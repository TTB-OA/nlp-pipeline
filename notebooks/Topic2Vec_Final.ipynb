Consuming an alcoholic beverage with an unlabeled allergen can be life-threatening, and the failure to implement this policy would lead to a dangerous gap in current food and beverage labling standards in the US. Witho ||| I write in favor of this regulation.<br/><br/>I think it is wise to require major food allergens to be included on labels for wines, spirits, and malt beverages.
