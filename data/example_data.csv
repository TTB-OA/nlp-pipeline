We write separately here to underscore how \nthis rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and \nto urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the \nbasic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other \nbeverages and food. \nLeading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol \nlabeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates \nalcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers \nwhat’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with \ncheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, \nCalley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full \ntransparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 \nCFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol \nlabeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the \navailable evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have \ndocumented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that \n \n1 hƩps://foodbabe.com/alcoholic-drink/  \n2 hƩps://foodbabe.com/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/  \n3 hƩps://www.statnews.com/2025/01/14/alcohol-health-risks-rŅ-jr-maha  \n4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but \nsignificant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  \nSimilarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard \ndrinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate \ntheir alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that \ndo not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more \nconscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of \nalcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related \nharms.7  \nThese spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to \nconsumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for \nSurgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third \nbiggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can \nincrease the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public \nawareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate \ndrinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating \nthe health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage \nLabeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that \nworthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its \npledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  \nThere is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see \non the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism \ncan end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   \nThank you for your consideration of these comments.  \nSincerely,  \n  \nThomas Gremillion \n Director of Food Policy \n Consumer Federation of America \n \n \n5 hƩps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/arƟcle/abs/pii/S0091743517302359  \n6 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.1186/s12889-023-16327-x  \n7 Rossow I, Mäkelä P.

Labeling \n \nThe labeling of the products covered by this \nStandard, in addition to complying with the \nprovisions of the Regulations and other applicable \nlegal provisions, shall be subject to the following: \n(…) \n“Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"" \nThis wording differs from the current voluntary \nallergen declaration (interim rule,  T.D. TTB -53 \n(71 FR 42260) which states that in alcoholic \nbeverages such as wines and distilled spirits, \nprimary allergens may be voluntarily declared \non labels affix ed to the container. The \ndeclaration must consist of the word \n""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of \nthe food source of each allergen (e.g., \n""Contains: egg""). \n9.3 Mandatory Requirements. The following are \nmandatory sanitary and commercial information \nrequirements: \n(…) \n9.3.7 Sanitary Information. \n \n9.3.7.7 List of ingredients. \n9.3.7.1.1 The list of ingredients must appear on the \nlabel of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or \ncreams and all these alcoholic beverages, which \nafter distillation and/or before bottling use \noptional ingredient s and/or additives that cause \nhypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy and are \npresent in the final product. \nDefinition of Major Food Allergen: \n \n""The proposed regulations define the term \n""major food allergen"" as any of the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Milk \n\uf0b7 Egg \n\uf0b7 Fish (e.g.,  bass, flounder, or cod) \nCrustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, \nor shrimp) \n\uf0b7 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or \nwalnuts) \n\uf0b7 Wheat \n\uf0b7 Peanuts \n\uf0b7 Soybeans \n\uf0b7 Sesame \n \nThe defined term also includes any food \ningredient that contains protein derived from \none of these nine foods or food groups, subject \nto certain exceptions. \nThe following foods and ingredients have been \nshown to cause hypersensitivity and must always \nbe declared: \n \n9.3.7.1.1.1 Cereals containing gluten, e.g.: wheat, \nrye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybr idized strains, \nand products thereof; \n \n9.3.7.1.1.2 Egg and its products; \n \n9.3.7.1.1.3 Peanut and its products; \n \n9.3.7.1.1.4 Soy and its products, with the \nexception of soybean oil; \n \n9.3.7.1.1.5 Milk and dairy products, including \nlactose; \n \n9.3.7.1.1.6 Tree nuts and their derivatives, and \n \n9.3.7.1.1.7 Sulfite in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or \nmore. \nCompliance Period: The TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date a final rule \nresulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. \nIn Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that food allergens must be declared in the \ningredient list only if they are present in the final product, without the need for a specific warning, \nand only in liqueurs or creams, cocktails, and prepared beverages. \nOn the other hand, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with \nthe phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the example \n""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". Furthermore, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim rule, T.D. TTB-53 \n(71 FR 42260)) establishes that in alcoholic beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, p rimary \nallergens may be voluntarily declared on labels.  The declaration must consist of the word \n""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the food source of each allergen (e.g., ""Contains: \negg""). However, the TTB proposal seeks to make allergen declaration mandatory. It should be noted \nthat the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in distilled alcoholic beverages, \nprovided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes a distillation process that completely \nremoves any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled product or ingredient. \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement (“Contains major \nfood allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major \nfood allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including \nthe following: \n\uf0b7 “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major \nfood allergen is derived; or \n\uf0b7 A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other \nlanguage and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. \nWhile we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that adding \nan additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real benefit to the \nconsumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for manufacturers, importers, and \ndistributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which would go against \nArticle 2.2 of the World Trade Organization\'s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks \nto avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers. The CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the \nGeneral Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), recommends that allergen \ndeclaration be preferably done within the ingredient list.  In cases where a separate declaration is \nrequired, it should be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the \nallergen and, when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.  The \ninterim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily \ndeclare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include the word ""Contains"", \nfollowed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as ""Contains: egg"". It is proposed \nthat the TTB consider the possibility of declaring major allergens as part of the ingredient list, which \nis only mandatory for prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients that \ncause hypersensitivity and are present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word \n""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for \nthe consumer to understand and would be in line with the current regulation for voluntary allergen \ndeclaration in alcoholic beverages. \nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developme nt (OECD) recommends that \ninformation on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and that \nexcessive information can confuse the consumer. If it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic beverage labeling, it \nis essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to provide additional information.  \nThis can be achieved through electronic labeling, using a QR code, a digital medium, or a website. \nThis tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited space for consumer information, presenting it \nin a friendly and easy-to-understand format. In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in \nregulatory provisions, and facilitates information reaching young people, a vulnerable g roup, to \nprevent harmful alcohol consumption.  It also allows for the development of educational and \ninteractive content for the consumer.  Thus, consumers would be effectively informed without \noverloading alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. \n2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement \non labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? \nVoluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To clearly \nand accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed that it be sufficient to include them in \nthe product\'s ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen\'s name.  It is \nalso proposed to consider the use of e lectronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to \ndisplay this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  \n3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major \nfood allergens in the list of  ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen \nstatement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the “Contains” \nstatement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA\'s approach? Should TTB limit the use of \nthe “Contains” statement only for major food allergens? \nIt is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient list, \nincluding the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section.  It is also suggested to \nevaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display detailed \nallergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical product label. \n4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C \nYellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) be required to be listed in one \nstatement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement \nthat includes the major food allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the \nmajor food allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for \nexample, “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another statement be \nused for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow \nNo. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” \nstatement for major food allergens? \nIt is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, as they \ncan easily identify them on the label.  Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic labeling (QR \ncodes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding  overloading the \nphysical product label. \n 5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including the \nproposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this information? \nWould such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on industry members \nas compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately? \nRequiring specific wording and location for allergen information on the label can create trade \nbarriers and increase costs, negatively affecting the trade of alcoholic beverages.  Therefore, it is \nproposed that this information can be placed anywhere on the label.  According to studies by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), presenting too much information \ntogether can make it difficult for consumers to identify important data. To avoid this, it is suggested \nto consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display \nadditional allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical label. \n6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements for major \nallergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already applicable to all mandatory \ninformation on alcohol beverage l abels? For example, should the required allergen disclosure \nstatement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent practicable, should TTB mandate formatting \nconsistent with FDA requirements for major allergen labeling? \nIt is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for allergen \ndeclarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional costs for \nmanufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs could be considered \na tec hnical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization\'s \nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade \nbarriers. This agreement establishes that technical regulations should  not be implemented that \nhinder international trade without valid justification in the legitimate objectives of member states. \nIn the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985): \nProvisions for Allergen Labeli ng of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established that the \npresentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. Should a separate \ndeclaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains ________"" (or an equivalent term) \nand be placed directly below or very near the ingredient list, when present.  This provision avoids \nthe use of a more extensive legend, which could confuse the consumer. \nConclusion: \nBased on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic beverages \nbe presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs and barriers to \ninternational trade.  Likewise, it is proposed that the declaration of major allergens in alcoholic \nbeverages be limited to thei r inclusion in the ingredient list.  Should an additional declaration be \nrequired, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the CODEX Alimentarius and the \nVoluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)), using only the legend \n""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a more extensive text. It is essential that \nthe possibility of using electronic labeling (through QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to \nprovide additional information or legends about ma jor allergens be considered.  This method \nfacilitates access to relevant information for the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary \nregulatory and commercial burdens. \nEnd of the document  '}]",TTB-2025-0003-0179,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-08 18:18:29,,False,Comment 174:  Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT: Chamber of the Tequila Industry; Mexico),09000064b8eef27a,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, Camara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT for its acronym in Spanish)",me1-z7kt-m9wd,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,"Chamber of the Tequila Industry, (CNIT for its acronym in Spanish - Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera)",,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:20,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

BWSCNZ \nceased operations in December 2006, and the Application was taken over by the Brewers \nAssociation of New Zealand (BANZ). In referring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment \nReport refers to BWSCNZ for activities prior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  \n \nThe Applicant sought an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass (a processing \naid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain tropical and subtropical fish) on \nthe label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. The \nexemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a fining \nagent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse reactions \nin susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant provided evidence that dietary \nexposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption was extremely low. Results of oral \nchallenge studies were also provided indicating that isinglass did not cause an allergic \nreaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher than the \npotential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer and wine. \nA new Good Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in \nisinglass has also been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. \n \nAt Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public \nhealth and safety implications of this Application. At Draft Assessment, two options were \nproposed; (1) reject the Application thus maintaining the status quo; or (2) prepare a draft \nvariation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the requirement to \ndeclare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a \nclarifying agent.  \n \nRisk Assessment \n \nAt Final Assessment, the key risk assessment findings include: \n \n• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically \nrelevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  \n \n• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  \n   \n• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration \nor centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, \ndo not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  \n  \n• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not \ndetectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed \nin the filtration process; and \n  iii\n• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very \nlow and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in \nfish-allergic consumers.  \n \nTherefore, taking into account all of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of \nisinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic \nconsumers.  \n \nThe key risk assessment issues, including issues raised by submitters, are discussed in \nSection 8 of this Report. Additional information is provided at Attachment 3 – Risk \nAssessment Report and Attachment 4 – Food Technology Report. \n \nRisk Management \n \nAt Draft Assessment, submitters raised concerns regarding the maintenance of the quality of \nisinglass and its usage. FSANZ considers current production methods and market factors \nadequately address the quality of isinglass; and the usage and amount of isinglass in food \nproducts is managed through existing provisions in the Code for the use of processing aids. \nInformation from the wine and beer industries also emphasises that isinglass is sparingly used \nas it is one of the most expensive fining agents available.  \n \nSome submitters raised further concerns regarding the impact of an exemption on the \nprovision of information for informed choices. FSANZ notes, however, the particular issues \nraised were not in respect of allergenicity or related matters and, therefore, fall beyond the \nscope of this Application.  \n \nDue to the above factors, FSANZ does not consider further regulatory measures are required. \nFurther detail is provided at Section 9 of this report. \n \nDecision \n \nFSANZ approves a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant an \nexemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer \nand wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. \n \nReasons for Decision \n \nFSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant \nexemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and \nwine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: \n \n• does not raise any health and safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers;  \n \n• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the \ninformation related to the allergenicity of the product. \n \n• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products; \n \n  iv\n• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen \ndeclaration; and \n \n• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass \non the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, \nprovides a net benefit to affected parties. \n \nThe approved draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. \n \nConsultation \n \nIn response to the release of the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ received twenty-seven \nsubmissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from industry, two from \ngovernment and one from a public health organisation. A summary of submissions on the \nDraft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. \n \nOverall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to \nproviding an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption. Of the \nremaining two submitters, one provided support, in-principle, indicating concern that the \nevidence did not show that there is no risk. The other indicated support based on a condition \nthat FSANZ consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced \nlevels of parvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration.  \n \nA significant proportion of submitters who objected to the proposed exemption linked their \narguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information \nrelating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. \nThe requirement to declare isinglass was seen to enable consumers to make informed choices \nabout foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons with a particular \nfocus on vegetarianism/veganism.  \n \nThere were two submitters who objected to an exemption as they believed they had \nexperienced an allergic fish-related reaction from consuming wine. Further information was \nsourced from these submitters in relation to their allergic condition and the products that may \nhave caused allergic reactions.   \n \nAfter considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ clarified some of \nthe issues raised by submitters through targeted consultations.  \n  \nImplementation and Review \n \nThe FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food \nRegulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). \n \nSubject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to \ngrant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer \nand wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal. \n \n \n  \n 1\nCONTENTS \n \nINTRODUCTION....................................................................................................................3 \n1.

BWSCNZ ceased operations in December 2006, and \nthe Application was taken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand (BANZ). In \nreferring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment Report refers to BWSCNZ for activities \nprior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  \n \nThis Final Assessment Report discusses matters in relation to providing an exemption from \nthe allergen labelling requirements for isinglass and addresses issues raised in submissions to \nthe Draft Assessment Report. The draft variation to the Code is provided at Attachment 1. \n \n1. Nature of the Application \n \n1.1 Background to the Application \n \nOn 12 August 2002, the BWSCNZ, on behalf of the Brewing Industry of New Zealand, wrote \nto FSANZ requesting that an exemption be granted for isinglass from the mandatory \ndeclaration requirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory \nStatements and Declarations. In the accompanying documentation that was provided to \nFSANZ, the BWSCNZ requested a permanent exemption, or if this was not possible, a \ntemporary exemption, to allow further scientific evidence to be obtained regarding the non-\nallergenicity of isinglass.   \n \nOn 20 September 2002, FSANZ responded to this request, advising that, in the absence of \nsubstantial scientific evidence on the relationship between residual levels of isinglass in beer \nand associated allergenicity, it was not in a position to consider exemptions to the \nrequirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. However, FSANZ advised that it would consider \nan application to amend the Standard should further research provide persuasive new \nevidence in this area. \n \nOn 6 January 2003, the BWSCNZ resubmitted the document dated 12 August 2002 and \nrequested that it be considered as an application. It was formally accepted and placed on the \nFSANZ Work Plan on 7 February 2003.  \n \nOn 15 October 2003, the Applicant requested that wine also be considered within the scope \nof their Application. Additionally, the Applicant requested a four-year exemption from the \nrequirement to label for isinglass, in line with the European Commission’s proposed \namendment to Directive 2000/13/EC. Under this amendment, the European Commission \nproposed to consider temporary exemptions from allergen labelling until November 2007, for \nderivatives of allergens that are unlikely to cause allergic reactions, while awaiting further \nscientific evidence for a permanent exemption.   \n \nOn 19 December 2003, FSANZ agreed to expand the scope of the Application to include \nwine. However, FSANZ did not agree to the request for a temporary exemption and sought \nfurther information from the Applicant under subsection 34(1) of the Food Standards \nAustralia New Zealand Act 1991 (FSANZ Act) (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). A \nresponse to this request was received on 28 June 2004.   \n 4\nHowever, further information provided by the Applicant was considered to be insufficient \nand a subsequent request for information under subsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was \nin force prior to 1 July 2007) was sent in December 2004.  \n \nMeanwhile in October 2004, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that \nwas submitted to the European Commission by the Brewers of Europe, and the Brewing, \nFood and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BE/BFBi) under the requirements of \nCommission Directive 2003/89/EC. This dossier titled ‘Notification for the temporary \nexemption from labelling for isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing’ (the BE/BFBi \nnotification), was used by FSANZ in the assessment of this Application.   \n \nOn 16 May 2005, FSANZ received further information from the Applicant and proceeded to \nthe Initial Assessment of Application A490. The Initial Assessment Report for Application \nA490 was advertised for public comment from 5 October to 16 November 2005. Following \nan assessment of submitters’ comments, together with the information provided by the \nApplicant, FSANZ concluded that sufficient information was not available to progress the \nApplication to the Draft Assessment stage. \n \nIn March 2006, FSANZ requested the Applicant to provide further information under \nsubsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). In February 2008, \nFSANZ received further information from the Applicant, and proceeded to the Draft \nAssessment.  \n \nThe Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director, \nAllergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Loblay endorsed the FSANZ \npreferred regulatory approach. The Draft Assessment Report was advertised for public \ncomment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. Following an assessment of the comments \nreceived from submitters and the completion of targeted consultations with submitters on \nspecific issues raised by them, FSANZ proceeded to the Final Assessment.  \n \n1.2 Basis of the Application \n \nThe Applicant is seeking to amend the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of \nStandard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared when present in food as \nan ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food additive or component of a \nfood additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing aid.   \n \nSpecifically, the Applicant is seeking an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass \non the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. \nIsinglass is a permitted processing aid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain \ntropical and subtropical fish. A statement such as ‘Produced with isinglass (fish product)’ is \nused to declare isinglass on the label. The exemption was initially sought on the basis that \nisinglass has a long history of use as a fining agent in the production of beer and wine and has \nnot been known to cause adverse reactions in fish-allergic individuals.  \n \n1.3 Scope of the Application \n \nThis Application is specific to the use of isinglass in the production of beer and wine only.  \n  \n 5\nIsinglass, for the purpose of this Application, is defined as a piscine collagen derived \nexclusively from the dried swim bladder of tropical and subtropical fish species for use as a \nfining/clarifying agent in beer and wine. Collagen derived from other parts of fish has not \nbeen considered in this Application.  \n \n1.4 Additional information provided by th e Applicant since Initial Assessment \n \nDuring Initial Assessment in 2005, FSANZ was aware of a number of scientific studies in \nprogress in Europe, USA and Australia aimed at addressing outstanding questions on the \nallergenic potential of isinglass. Results of these studies were made available to FSANZ as \ndetailed below.  \n \nIn February 2008, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that was \nsubmitted to the European Commission in October 2006 jointly by the BE and the BFBi, in \nsupport of a request for an extension of the exclusion from Annex IIIa of Commission \nDirective 2005/26/EC beyond 25 November 2007, and thus, from the requirement to label \nisinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing. This dossier contained analytical studies and \nclinical trials on isinglass coordinated by FARRP (Food Allergy Research and Resource \nProgram), University of Nebraska, USA. Further investigations related to residues of \nisinglass in beer were carried out by Brewing Research International. \n \nIn April 2008, the Australian Wine Research Institute and Wine Federation of Australia \nprovided relevant scientific information in relation to the use of isinglass in wine. In addition, \nFSANZ requested specific information in relation to the supply and usage of isinglass by \nAustralian and New Zealand beer and wine manufacturers.   \n \nThese documents answered the outstanding questions on the allergenic potential of isinglass \nand enabled the completion of the Draft Assessment of this Application. \n \n2. The Issue \n \nCurrently, clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared \nwhen present in food as an ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food \nadditive or component of a food additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing \naid. This declaration enables fish-allergic consumers to be aware of the presence of any \npotential allergenicity in the food and provides for informed choices in the context of health \nand safety.   \n \nThe exemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a \nfining agent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse \nreactions in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant has provided evidence that \ndietary exposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption is extremely low. Results of \noral challenge studies have also been provided indicating that isinglass does not cause an \nallergic reaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher \nthan the potential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer \nand wine. Parvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. A new \nGood Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in isinglass has \nalso been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. \n  \n 6\nThe issue is whether granting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the \nlabel, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, can have an \nimpact on the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers. That is, is consumption of \nisinglass-fined beer or wine likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic \nconsumers and therefore, is the fish-related declaration meaningful to those consumers? \n \n3. Objectives \n \nThe specific objectives for the assessment of this Application are to: \n \n• consider the granting of an exemption from the mandatory requirement to declare \nisinglass on the label of beer and wine; \n \n• ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergic to \nfish; and \n \n• ensure adequate label information is provided to fish-allergic consumers. \n \nIn developing or varying a food standard, FSANZ is required by its legislation to meet three \nprimary objectives which are set out in section 18 of the FSANZ Act.  These are: \n \n• the protection of public health and safety; \n \n• the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make \ninformed choices; and \n \n• the prevention of misleading or deceptive conduct. \n \nIn developing and varying standards, FSANZ must also have regard to: \n \n• the need for standards to be based on risk analysis using the best available scientific \nevidence; \n \n• the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards; \n \n• the desirability of an efficient and internationally competitive food industry; \n \n• the promotion of fair trading in food; and \n \n• any written policy guidelines formulated by the Ministerial Council. \n \n4. Historical Background \n \nThe current mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 were developed during the \nreview of the Code, as part of Proposal P161 – Review of Specific Labelling Statements, and \nwas gazetted in December 2000. The list of substances included in the Table to clause 4 of \nStandard 1.2.3 is based on the recommendations of an Expert Panel commissioned by the \nthen Australia New Zealand Food Authority.   \n 7\nThese substances are: cereals containing gluten and their products, namely, wheat, rye, \nbarley, oats and spelt and their hybridised strains; crustacea and their products; egg and egg \nproducts; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; tree nuts and sesame seeds and their \nproducts; peanuts and soybeans and their products; and added sulphites in concentrations of \n10 mg/kg or more.   \n  \nTo qualify for mandatory declaration, the substance(s) needed to be recognised by medical \nexperts as a frequent cause of severe systemic reactions resulting in significant morbidity or \nmortality. \n \nThe justification for the mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 was based on \nthe requirement to protect the health and safety of those individuals who are susceptible to \nadverse reactions from certain foods or substances in foods.     \n \nAmong the substances included in the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3, the Code grants \nexemption from mandatory labelling declaration for beer and spirits made using cereals \ncontaining gluten.   \n \n5. Current Regulations \n \n5.1 Current domestic regulations \n \n5.1.1 Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code \n \nThe Standards relevant to this Application are 2.7.2 – Beer, 2.7.4 – Wine and Wine Product, \n1.3.3 – Processing Aids and Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements \nand Declarations. \n \nAlcoholic beverages meet the definition for food in the FSANZ Act and are therefore \nrequired to comply with the General Food Standards set out in Part 1 of the Code. In addition, \nbeer and wine are further regulated by Part 2.7 – Alcoholic Beverages and are defined in \nStandards 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 respectively.  \n \nThe Table to clause 6 in Standard 1.3.3 permits isinglass to be used as a processing aid in \nfood. This Standard defines a processing aid as a permitted substance used in the processing \nof raw materials, foods or ingredients, at the lowest level necessary irrespective of any \nmaximum permitted level specified, to fulfil a technological purpose relating to treatment or \nprocessing, but does not perform a technological function in the final food. The Table to \nclause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in \nregulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The \nrelevant GMP criteria are: \n \n(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to \naccomplish its desired effect;  \n \n(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, \nprocessing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any \nphysical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent \nreasonably possible; and  \n 8\n(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. \n \nThe Standard most relevant to this Application is Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 \nrequires that the presence of fish or fish products in a food must be declared on a label (or \ndeclared in connection with the display of the food or provided to the purchaser on request \nwhen a food is not required to bear a label). This requirement is irrespective of the fish or fish \nproduct being used as an ingredient; a compound ingredient; a food additive; or a processing \naid.  \n \n5.1.2 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report \n \nSuggestions were raised by some submitters to the Draft Assessment Report with respect to \ndealing with exemptions for allergens more generically, rather than on the basis of individual \napplications. These are addressed below. \n  \n• Possible exemptions from the allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3 should be dealt \nwith in a systematic and broader fashion and not through individual applications. \n \nApplications to FSANZ seeking to change the Code are made by individuals, organisations or \ncompanies. FSANZ is required to respond to and assess each application received. Applying \ngeneral criteria to all possible exemptions from allergen declarations may not be practical due \nto the diversity of products and their applications. The risk assessment process may require \ncase specific scientific information, as is the case in this Application. \n \n• Standard 1.2.3 should be reviewed so that there is no requirement to declare products of \nallergens where it can be demonstrated that they do not contain the allergenic protein. \n \nFSANZ considers the above issue to be beyond the scope of this Application. At the request \nof the Ministerial Council, FSANZ has commenced a review of the regulatory management \nof food allergens. The overall aim of the review is to determine whether regulatory and non-\nregulatory measures are meeting the needs of allergic consumers in a manner that is practical \nfor industry to implement, and that is effective in achieving the objectives of food regulatory \nmeasures outlined in the FSANZ Act. A number of issues relevant to the regulatory \nmanagement of food allergens are being considered including a framework to identify non-\nallergenic ingredients derived from allergenic foods. \n \n5.2 Overseas and international regulations \n \n5.2.1 Codex Alimentarius \n \nThe Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods [Codex Stan 1-1985] \nrequires the mandatory declaration of substances that are known to cause adverse reactions. \nThe list of substances that are required to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’, in \naddition to other major food allergens. The use of isinglass as a processing aid is subject to \ningredient declaration in accordance with Sections 4.2.1.4 and 4.2.4 of the General Standard \nfor the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods.  \n \nThe Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods has been in place for \nmany years and no revision relevant to the exemption considered here has taken place as yet.   \n 9\nFSANZ’s consideration of the labelling exemption for isinglass used in the clarifying process \nof wine and beer is based on the more recent scientific information available and is in line \nwith other international regulations. \n \n5.2.2 United States of America \n \nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Food Allergen Labelling \nand Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) applies to most domestic and imported \nfood and beverage products. However, it is the responsibility of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax \nand Trade Bureau (TTB) to issue regulations with respect to the labelling of wine, distilled \nspirits and malt beverages. In July 2006, the TTB proposed mandatory labelling of major \nfood allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages. The proposition of mandatory \nallergen labelling parallels amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \ncontained in the FALCPA.  \n \nThese proposed regulations were published as an interim rule which allows producers, \nbottlers and importers of alcoholic beverages to voluntarily declare the presence of major \nallergens (including fish and proteins derived from fish). The interim regulations set forth \nmandatory requirements for how such labelling must be applied should an industry member \nchoose to do so. The purpose of introducing interim regulations was to allow adequate time \nfor consultation on the proposed final regulations whilst encouraging the alcohol beverage \nindustry to introduce allergen labelling.  \n \nThe proposed regulations and interim rule establishes a petition process through which a food \ningredient may be exempted from the labelling requirements if the ingredient does not cause \nan allergic response that poses a risk to human health or if the ingredient does not contain \nallergenic protein. FSANZ is aware that the TTB is currently considering petitions for the \nexemption of isinglass. \n \n5.2.3 Canada \n \nIn February 2004, Health Canada proposed amending the Food and Drug Regulations to \nenhance allergen labelling requirements on pre-packaged foods for specific allergens. This \nproposal included the requirement for mandatory labelling of fish by species name. In \nSeptember 2004, Health Canada amended its original proposal such that fining agents derived \nfrom fish, milk and egg, used during the manufacture of standardised alcoholic beverages, \nwould be exempt from the allergen labelling requirements.   \n \nHealth Canada recently published its proposed regulatory amendments for allergen labelling \n(including the exemption from labelling for isinglass and other fining agents) in Canada \nGazette, Part I in July 2008. The final regulations are expected to be published in the Canada \nGazette, Part II, in early 2009. The exemption was based on a history of use of such fining \nagents and the lack of documented clinical evidence of allergic reactions caused by \nconsumption of these products. Health Canada has expressed that it may reconsider its \nposition on a labelling exemption for fining agents used in the production of standardised \nalcoholic beverages, should scientific evidence become available suggesting that residues of \nthese substances remaining in the final beverage could cause a health risk to susceptible \nindividuals.     \n  \n 10\n5.2.4 European Union Member Countries \n \nThe European Commission’s Directive 2000/13/EC provides for the possibility of an \nexclusion from the allergen labelling requirement for substances derived from allergenic \ningredients, for which it has been scientifically established that such substances are unlikely \nto cause an adverse reaction in susceptible individuals. As a result, Commission Directive \n2005/26/EC granted a temporary allergen labelling exemption for specific derivatives of \nallergenic ingredients or substances until 25 November 2007. This provisional list of \nexemptions included ‘fish gelatine or isinglass used as a fining agent in beer, cider and wine’. \n  \nDuring the period of this temporary labelling exemption, industry sectors wishing to make an \napplication for a permanent labelling exemption were responsible for submitting research to \nthe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA received and considered applications for \na permanent labelling exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in beer and wine \nproduction.  \n \nEFSA considered the information on isinglass used in wine and concluded that ‘the data \nsubmitted do not allow the Panel to assess the likelihood that isinglass used as fining agent \nwill trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals under conditions of use stated by \nthe applicant’.  \n \nEFSA also considered, separately, information on isinglass used in beer and concluded that \n‘it is not very likely that isinglass used as a clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe \nallergic reaction in susceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use \nspecified by the applicant’.  \n \nThe Commission considered EFSA’s opinions and concluded that a permanent exemption \nfrom allergen labelling should apply to isinglass used in the production of both beer and \nwine. Annex IIIa of Commission Directive 2000/13/EC was amended by Commission \nDirective 2007/68/EC as of 27 November 2007. This amendment stipulates a revised \nregulatory approach to allergen labelling and includes the requirement that fish and products \nthereof must be declared on a label except fish gelatine and isinglass used as a fining agent in \nbeer and wine.  \n \n5.2.5 Japan \n \nJapan’s current allergen labelling requirements became enforceable in April 2002 and divides \nallergen labelling into two categories, mandatory and recommended, according to the number \nof cases and degree of seriousness of allergic reactions.  \n \nFish is not included on the list of allergens requiring mandatory labelling (these are eggs, \nmilk, wheat, buckwheat and peanuts) and only specific species of fish (salmon and mackerel) \nare recommended for allergen labelling. \n \nFurthermore, alcohol beverages and related products are not subject to the allergen labelling \nrequirements. Hence labelling of isinglass and other fining agents used in the production of \nalcoholic beverages is not required in Japan.   \n  \n 11\n5.3 Regulatory differences and its impact \n \nAs stated above, labelling exemption for isinglass has already been granted in many \ncountries, including all of the European Union member countries. Currently, beverage \nmanufacturers in Australia and New Zealand supplying the market in these countries would \nhave to meet different isinglass declaration requirements for local and export markets. This \nregulatory difference to labelling may have an impact on trade and increase the costs to \nmanufacturers.  \n \n6 Matters of Relevance \n \nDetails of technical information and analytical data related to this Application are provided in \nthe Risk Assessment Report in Attachment 3 and the Food Technology Report in Attachment \n4. This section provides some key information related to isinglass. This information has been \nextracted from the documents provided by the Applicant, the Australian Wine Research \nInstitute, and the Wine Federation of Australia.  \n \n6.1 Parvalbumin \n \nParvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. Parvalbumins have \nmolecular weights of approximately 10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values\n1. Parvalbumins are water \nsoluble and resistant to heat treatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975 [as \ncited in Chen et al. 2006]).  \n \n6.2 Definition of isinglass \n \n6.2.1 Isinglass definition used by th e Applicant (submission 16 May 2005) \n \nIsinglass is a pure form of collagen, which is derived from the dried swim bladders of certain \ntropical and subtropical fish. In brewing, only isinglass from catfish, croakers and threadfins \nis used.  \n \n6.2.2 Isinglass definition from  the BE/BFBi notification \n \nIsinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen. Within the BE/BFBi notification, the term is \nused exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim bladders and does not \ninclude collagen from fish skins. This notification states that the isinglass used in brewing is a \npure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of a restricted range of specific \ntropical and subtropical fish species. These species are specific catfish, croakers and \nthreadfins.  \n \n6.3 Components of isinglass \n \nThe major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denaturation product, gelatin. \nIsinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. \nCollagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass. Only \nresidual amounts of the fish protein parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass.  \n \n                                                \n \n1 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     \n 12\n6.3.1 Collagen \n \nCollagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish \nmuscle, skin and swim bladder. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by \ncross linkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular \nweight of 800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, \nwhich are usually small, compact proteins with molecular weights ranging between 10 kDa \nand 80 kDa. \n \nCollagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to \nform random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass \nproduction because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from \ncoldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC.   \n \n6.4  Commercial production of isinglass \n \nThe swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish are used to produce isinglass on a \ncommercial scale for use in the alcohol beverage industry. The swim bladder is an air sac, \nlocated in the dorsal part of the body cavity quite separate from the fish muscle tissue. The \nadherence between the bladder and the body cavity is minimal and as such, it can be readily \ndetached without significant contamination with the fish muscle tissue.  \n \n6.4.1 Traditional processing method \n \nThe traditional basic production process has been reported to vary between manufacturers, \nwhich can also depend on the source and species of the fish. However, a number of steps are \nconsidered standard practice. Dried swim bladders are blended according to specific quality \nand other criteria, followed by granulation, washing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen \nperoxide and rinsing. A temperature of less than 15ºC is maintained throughout the wet steps.  \nThe product is then sold as powder, paste or liquid. The paste and liquid forms include a \nsource of sulphur dioxide as a preservative.  \n \nAs a result of the traditional processing method the final parvalbumin levels in isinglass have \nshown to be reduced by about a half compared to the starting material. \n \n6.4.2 New manufacturing protocol (Good Manufacturing Code of Practice) \n \nThe three major European isinglass manufacturers (AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and \nMurphy & Son Ltd) have developed a Good Manufacturing Code of Practice for the sourcing \nand manufacturing of isinglass. This new protocol, which minimises the parvalbumin content \nin isinglass, includes the following additional steps.  \n \n• The fish species with high parvalbumin level in the swim bladder have been excluded. \n \n• A granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed      \n25 mm has been introduced. This step increases the surface area thus ensuring adequate \nsterilising during peroxide wash and improving the extent of washing out of the \nparvalbumin in the subsequent buffer wash. \n  \n 13\n• Additional washing steps using phosphate buffer and further water washing have been \nintroduced. Phosphate buffer wash has shown to have the greatest effect in reducing \nparvalbumin levels in samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin levels.  \n \nAll of the isinglass produced by the major European manufacturers supplying to the \nAustralian and New Zealand markets is now produced in accordance with the Good \nManufacturing Code of Practice (new protocol) designed to minimise the levels of \nparvalbumin. \n \n6.4.3 Products used by the Applicant \n \nBased on the information received from the beer and the wine industry, isinglass \ncommercially available for their use in Australia and New Zealand is manufactured by the \nEuropean manufacturers AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son Ltd.  \n \nFSANZ has also been made aware of the existence of other European companies who are not \nmanufacturers of isinglass but resellers or blenders of fining agents who source the raw \nmaterial from the above mentioned manufacturers. In Australia and New Zealand, isinglass is \npredominantly sourced through a local supply network from the European manufacturers, \nblenders and resellers.  \n \n6.5 Isinglass as a processing  aid/clarifying agent  \n \n6.5.1 History of usage  \n \nAt Initial Assessment, the Applicant stated that isinglass has been used in the clarification of \nbeer and wine for over a hundred years. The dossier submitted by BE/BFBi in 2004 made a \nsimilar statement and, based on a rigorous literature search, concluded that no isinglass-\nrelated allergy cases have been reported. A further literature search was completed by \nBE/BFBi to identify any reports which might have been published since 2004. No reports of \nallergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish sensitised individuals have been found. \n \nA literature search has also shown no reports of any adverse reactions to wine ingestion that \nis attributable to the consumption of isinglass. \n \n6.5.2 Usage levels in beer and wine \n \nThe rod-like structural integrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for \nefficient clarification (Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the \nfining activity is based upon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically \nattract yeast cells with negatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged \npolyphenolic and protein components. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the \nbottom of the container.  In the sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in a \nfirm sediment that is resistant to disturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  \n \nThe Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 in the Code specifies the use of Good Manufacturing \nPractice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the food \n(i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  \n  \n 14\nIn the brewing process, isinglass is typically added after fermentation and cooling of the beer.  \nThe typical usage level is 15 mg/L for brewery conditioned beer and 35-60 mg/L for cask-\nconditioned beer. Isinglass is subsequently removed by sedimentation followed by filtration \nor centrifugation. Cask-conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or centrifugation and \nrelies on gravity settling.  \n \nIn the wine production process, isinglass is added prior to fermentation to remove phenolic \ncompounds from white juice or immediately post fermentation to remove yeast, phenolic and \ntannin compounds from white wine. The typical usage level is 10-25 mg/L for white wines. It \nis assumed that isinglass is seldom used in red and rosé wines. Isinglass is removed by \nsedimentation and filtration. The information provided by the Australian Wine Research \nInstitute states that a laboratory trial is undertaken on individual batches of wine prior to the \naddition of isinglass to accurately determine the amount of isinglass to be added so as not to \nresult in an over-fined wine. \n \n6.5.3 Residues of isinglass in beer and wine \n \nIsinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration or \ncentrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.   \n \n6.6 Toxicological assessment \n \nIsinglass is a natural product derived from the swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish. \nFSANZ is not aware of any toxicity concerns related to the use of isinglass as a clarifying \nagent. The BE/BFBi notification reports that in addition to being a source of isinglass, the \nfish swim bladders (also known as fish maws) are consumed as food in many parts of the \nworld. More than 2750 metric tons are accounted for by such consumption.  \n  \n7. Key Risk Assessment Questions \n \nWhat is the evidence in relation to the allergenicity of isinglass?  \n \nWhat is the level of isinglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an adverse \nreaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the final product? \n \nWhat is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then being \ncarried into the final product? \n \nRISK ASSESSMENT \n \n8. Risk Assessment Issues \n \nThis section assesses the allergenicity of isinglass and addresses risk assessment issues raised \nby submitters in response to the Draft Assessment Report. The full details of the risk \nassessment are presented in Attachment 3. \n  \n 15\n8.1 Allergenicity of isinglass \n \n8.1.1 What is the evidence in relation to  the allergenicity of isinglass?  \n \n• The three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not of \nclinical importance in IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin, the allergenic fish \nprotein of clinical significance, is only present in trace amounts in commercial \nisinglass. \n \n• A number of searches of the published literature failed to identify any reports of \nadverse reaction to wine or beer that can be attributed specifically to isinglass. \n \n• Oral challenge studies have indicated that isinglass manufactured according to either \nthe traditional or the new protocol, do not provoke allergic reactions. Two separate oral \nchallenge tests have been conducted using twenty-one fish-allergic patients in total. \nNone of the patients had positive reactions to the oral challenge tests.  \n \nThese findings support the conclusion that isinglass is unlikely to pose a risk to fish-allergic \nconsumers. \n \n8.2 Presence of isinglass in beer and wine \n \n8.2.1  What is the level of isi nglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an \nadverse reaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the \nfinal product? \n \n• The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing \nPractice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the \nfood (i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  \n \n• Isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, \nfiltration or centrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.  \n \n• Residual amounts of isinglass in bottled and canned beer are below the limit of \ndetection, and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/ L. Isinglass residues are 3 mg/L \nfor keg beer and 5 mg/L for cask beer.  \n \n• The results for wine indicate no residual isinglass has been detected in a small sample \nof commercially available wines fined with isinglass (detection limit 1 mg/L) and made \nfollowing GMP. Therefore, it has been concluded that the concentration of isinglass is \nlikely to be less than 1 mg/L. Results of subsequent analysis of isinglass-fined wines \nhave supported this conclusion. \n \n• The dose of isinglass, regardless of whether isinglass was manufactured according to \neither the old or new protocol, tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral \nchallenge studies, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of \nbeer or wine that could be consumed by an individual within a single sitting. \n  \n 16\n• Parvalbumin would only constitute a minute fraction of isinglass residue in beer or \nwine. This is supported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples \nfined using isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol.  \n \n8.3 Potential of parvalbumin partit ioning out into the bulk liquid  \n \n8.3.1 What is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then \nbeing carried into the final product? \n \nThe information provided by the Applicant indicates the following.   \n \n• Due to the inherent entrapment property of collagen, it can be expected that the \nparvalbumin residues present in isinglass would remain entrapped to a certain degree. \n \n• Parvalbumin is insoluble in the acidic conditions of beer and wine. Analytical testing of \nthe sediments indicates that parvalbumin indeed precipitates with the isinglass and is \nremoved prior to packaging the final product.  \n \n8.4 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report \n \nThe following issues were raised in relation to the risk assessment for this Application. \n \n• There is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass does not raise any safety concerns for \nfish-allergic consumers. \n \nThe Applicant provided information on three clinical studies that have been conducted, in \nAustralia and in Europe, to evaluate the effect of isinglass and isinglass-fined wine on fish-\nallergic consumers. The three clinical studies, which involved thirty-one fish-allergic patients \nin total, were conducted according to robust protocols. No allergic reactions related to \nisinglass were reported under the conditions of the oral challenges described in any of the \nstudies. Taking into account all the other information provided by the Applicant, these results \nsupport the conclusions that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any \nsafety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.   \n \nAdditionally, since 2005 an explicit exemption has been granted from declaration in beer and \nwine by the European Commission. FSANZ is not aware of any health risks or concerns in \nthe European Union member countries as a result of this exemption. \n \n• The literature review was based on only one search engine and used only two search \nterms.   \n \nThe Applicant has provided the outcomes of a total of three literature searches. Information \non two of the literature searches have been presented in the Initial Assessment Report and the \nDraft Assessment Report. Information on all three searches is now presented in the Final \nAssessment Report. All three searches have failed to identify any publications that may be \nrelevant to isinglass allergy. \n \n• There are uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod \nparvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived \nisinglass.   \n 17\nParvalbumin is a fish protein that appears to be highly conserved among a wide range of fish \nspecies including cod and tropical fish species.  \n \nAnalyses comparing available sequences from a range of fish species have demonstrated \nclose sequence similarity across many fish species as a general rule, and there is no reason to \nsuggest this would not be the case for fish species used in isinglass production. The well \npurified and characterised cod parvalbumin was used to generate polyclonal antibodies to \nparvalbumin, to provide broader specificity, allowing detection of parvalbumin from various \nfish species. Western blot data provided by the Applicant indicates that the cod-parvalbumin \npolyclonal antibodies detected parvalbumin from tropical fish species. The polyclonal \nantibodies were utilised in the cod-based ELISA. In addition, the Applicant also provided \ndata where a monoclonal carp-based ELISA was used to detect parvalbumin in various test \nsamples. The two methods vary slightly in their sensitivity and specificity, but together they \nprovided mutually supporting information on the level of parvalbumin in isinglass.  \n \n• The test numbers used in the clinical studies are small and therefore, have limited \nstatistical power. \n \nThe clinical studies provide information on a total of thirty-one fish-allergic patients, and \nundoubtedly a larger number would have been desirable. However, the fact that the number \nof fish-allergic patients that could be recruited is relatively small, may reflect the prevalence \nof fish allergy in the community. The targeted nature of the recruitment of fish-allergic \nindividuals and the strict qualifying criteria applied in the selection of participants, limits the \nnumber of subjects available to participate in clinical studies. No statistical analysis was \nundertaken due to the small number, however, the studies were conducted according to robust \nprotocols and no allergic reactions were reported under the conditions described in the report. \nIn this case, the high quality of the clinical testing data obtained using a panel of consumers \nclinically diagnosed to be fish allergic minimises concerns over quantity. These studies, \nwhich provide an important piece of scientific evidence, were not considered in isolation. \nTogether with other evidence, the clinical studies support the conclusions that consumption \nof isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic \nconsumers.   \n \n• One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed \npotatoes. This trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually \nconsumed. In addition, alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food \nallergic reaction in susceptible individuals. \n \nFifteen fish-allergic individuals, aged between 21-66 years, participated in a double-blind \nplacebo-controlled food challenge according to an internationally accepted protocol. The oral \nchallenge material was prepared using four doses (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) of \nisinglass in 40 g mashed potato. The use of mashed potato as a matrix made it possible to use \nsuch relatively high doses of isinglass. This could not be achieved if the oral challenge was \nconducted using isinglass-fined beer or wine based on the extremely low level of isinglass \n(generally below 1 mg/L) in such beverages.  \n \nIn relation to the role of alcohol in lowering the dose that may trigger an allergic reaction, it \nwould have to significantly lower the dose for it to be relevant to the level of isinglass that \ncould possibly be present in fined beer and wine (generally below 1 mg/L).   \n 18\nAlso, the study report indicates that all individuals have reported regularly consuming beer or \nwine, at least some of which would have been fined with isinglass, without incident. \n \nThis study should be considered in the context of two additional oral challenge studies \nprovided by the Applicant. These are briefly outlined: \n \nA second study was conducted on a younger group of fish-allergic individuals, aged between \n6-22 years with isinglass in mashed potato. No allergic reactions were reported in any of the \nsix individuals tested up to a dose of 20 mg isinglass.   \n \nThe third study included ten fish-allergic subjects and each consumed 100 mL of isinglass-\nfined or control wine over 10-15 minutes. No subjects developed an allergic reaction \nrequiring medical treatment and no abnormalities were noted during follow-up reports. \n \nCollectively, information from all the oral challenge studies presented by the Applicant, \nincluding those where mashed potato was used as a matrix, support the conclusion of the risk \nassessment.   \n \n• The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-\nallergenicity. Whilst most known allergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a \nnecessary condition for allergenicity. Therefore, this method is unsuitable for assessing \nthe allergenicity of isinglass. \n \nPepsin digestion information was submitted by the Applicant. However, the information was \nnot considered in the risk assessment and had no bearing on the risk assessment conclusion. \nReference to pepsin digestion has been deleted in the Final Assessment Report. \n \n• The data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand \npopulations and the threshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are \nunknown. \n \nFSANZ acknowledges the general lack of information on the prevalence of various food \nallergies in Australia and New Zealand. There is currently no consensus on a threshold dose \nfor fish allergens. Such information would be a valuable resource and would certainly add to \nthe strength of the evidence base for the assessment of isinglass. However, even in the \nabsence of such information it is possible to reach a scientific conclusion based on all the \nother information that is available. For example, a published report of a clinical study \nconducted in Australia provides such information. The study, discussed in more detail in the \nRisk Assessment Report, presents outcomes of an oral challenge of ten adult fish-allergic \nindividuals with isinglass-fined and un-fined wine. No allergic reactions were reported during \ntwo hours post challenge and over the following six days.  \n \n• There is a possibility of significant under-reporting of allergic reactions due to: \n \n- a lack of awareness among wine drinkers and health professionals of the possible \npresence of fish proteins in wine \n- the tendency to blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse \nreactions occurred \n- the lack of reporting of food allergic reactions to an authority or a medical \npractitioner, especially in adult sufferers  \n 19\n- the absence of a requirement in New Zealand for food allergic reactions to be \nreported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the \nreaction in a public journal. \n \nClinical studies discussed above indicate that fish-allergic individuals do not react to isinglass \nor isinglass-fined wine. Also, the extremely low level of isinglass and the even lower level of \nparvalbumin that may be present in isinglass-fined beer and wine argues against these \nsuggestions. \n \n• The evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under \nthe new code of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in \nthe Draft Assessment Report.  \n \nThe Draft Assessment Report presents analytical data on bottled beer and wine which \nindicates that the level of residual isinglass, if it can be detected at all, is around 1 mg/L. This \nresidual level would be expected regardless of whether the isinglass was prepared according \nto the old or new protocol. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-allergic consumers, \nwould only constitute a minute fraction of the isinglass residue in beer or wine. This is \nsupported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples fined using \nisinglass prepared according to the old or the new protocol. On this basis, information can be \nextrapolated and will be clarified as such in the Final Assessment Report.  \n \n• The allergenic fish proteins are normally found in the flesh of the fish, but in some rare \ncases, also collagen can cause allergies. Isinglass contains this particular collagen \nwhich is found in fish so theoretically it can cause, in select individuals, an \nanaphylactic reaction. \n \nThere is no credible evidence to support the clinical relevance of this statement. Collagen is \nnot considered by allergy clinicians to be a significant fish allergen and FSANZ is not aware \nof any reports of anaphylactic reactions to fish collagen. The medical literature reports that \nIgE to fish collagen has been detected in only a few Japanese individuals. However, the \nclinical relevance of these findings has not been confirmed by oral challenges. In addition, \nthe oral challenge studies presented in the Risk Assessment Report do not support the \nsuggestion that collagen is relevant in fish allergy. In two of these studies, twenty-one fish-\nallergic individuals of various ages, were challenged with up to 50 mg fish isinglass (collagen \nfrom the fish swim bladder) within a period of two hours. No allergic reactions were reported \nin any of these individuals.  \n \n• The assessment that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely\n to \npresent a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, does not indicate that \nthere is no risk. \n \nFood regulation does not aim to achieve, and can not deliver, zero risk. FSANZ risk analysis \nindicates the consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of \nallergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers and therefore it does not require a regulatory \nmeasure.  \n \n• Two submitters objected to providing an exemption as they have experienced allergic \nreactions to wine containing fish products and/or seaweed. \n  \n 20\nFurther information was sought from these submitters. One indicated a seaweed specific \nallergy and no allergy to fish or shellfish. Isinglass is derived from the swim bladders of fish \nand is not a derivative of seaweed. \n \nAdditionally, the labelling exemption is specific to isinglass alone, for use as a clarifying \nagent in the production of beer and wine. Isinglass and seaweed are unrelated and therefore, \nthe issue raised by the submitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  \n \nThe other submitter indicated an allergy to fish and shellfish which had been diagnosed by a \nmedical practitioner specialising in allergies. This submitter also indicated the use of a skin \nprick test as part of the diagnosis. This submitter was unable to provide the details of the wine \nthat caused the allergic reaction except for the information that the product contained a \nstatement ‘may contain fish products’. In this case it cannot be categorically concluded that \nthe reaction to wine ingestion experienced by this submitter is attributable to isinglass \nwithout further information and testing.  \n \nThe scientific evidence shows that isinglass does not raise any health and safety concerns for \nfish-allergic consumers. In addition, as stated previously since 2005 an explicit exemption \nhas been granted from declaration in beer and wine by the European Commission. FSANZ is \nnot aware of any health risks or concerns in the European Union member countries as a result \nof this exemption. FSANZ is unable to conclude that the allergic reactions mentioned above \nare related to the use of isinglass in the fining process of the wine.   \n \n• One submitter indicated that a family member had experienced a severe reaction to fish \ncontaining a ciguatoxin and continues to experience reactions in circumstances such as, \nwhen coming into contact with objects such as hand rails which people who have \nhandled fish have touched. \n \nFish contaminated with ciguatoxin causes food borne illness in humans, which is unrelated to \nfish allergy. The Primary Production and Processing Standard for Seafood (Standard 4.2.1) \nregulates the safety of all seafood in Australia, including toxin contamination. In New \nZealand these requirements are covered by the New Zealand Fishing Industry Agreed \nImplementation Standards. Application A490 deals specifically with the exemption of \nisinglass from the labelling requirements of mandatory allergen declarations in Standard \n1.2.3.  Isinglass and ciguatoxin are completely unrelated and therefore, the issue raised by the \nsubmitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  \n \n8.5 Summary of risk assessment  \n \nIn summary, the key risk assessment findings include: \n \n• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically \nrelevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  \n \n• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  \n   \n• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration \nor centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, \ndo not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  \n   \n 21\n• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not \ndetectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed \nin the filtration process; and \n \n• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very \nlow and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in \nfish-allergic consumers.  \n \nOn the basis of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and \nwine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.  \n \nRISK MANAGEMENT \n \n9. Risk Management Measures \n \nAt Draft Assessment submitters raised their concerns regarding the maintenance of the \nquality of isinglass and its usage, and impact on the provision of information for informed \nchoices. These matters are addressed below.  \n \n9.1 Maintaining the quality of isinglass  \n \nIsinglass is a highly valued clarifying agent and is specifically sought by wine and beer \nmanufacturers for its superior functionality compared to other clarifying agents. There are a \nnumber of market factors that underpin maintenance of high quality isinglass including:  \n \n• Isinglass commercially available for use by the beer and wine industry in Australia and \nNew Zealand is manufactured by AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son \nLtd. These are the three major manufacturers supplying the world market. \n \n• These three manufacturers have come together in developing a Good Manufacturing \nCode of Practice, for the manufacture of isinglass low in parvalbumin (new \nmanufacturing protocol).  \n \n• All of the isinglass produced by these manufacturers is now produced in accordance \nwith the new manufacturing protocol. \n \n• The commercially available isinglass referred to above has an established market \nadvantage and is widely used by the beverage manufacturers who seek a superior \nfunctionality. Any quality issues will undermine its status and use in the market place. \nAs such, there would be no obvious advantage or incentive for isinglass manufacturers \nto compromise the quality of isinglass.  \n \n9.2 Usage of isinglass \n \nThe usage of isinglass is regulated in the Code. The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 – \nProcessing Aids, specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice in regulating the \nmaximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The relevant Good \nManufacturing Practice criteria for isinglass include: \n  \n 22\n(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to \naccomplish its desired effect; \n  \n(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, \nprocessing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any \nphysical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent \nreasonably possible; and \n(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. \n \nAdditionally, information from the industry indicates that isinglass is sparingly used as it is \none of the most expensive fining agents available. \n  \n9.3 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report \n \nThis section addresses risk management issues raised by submitters in response to the Draft \nAssessment Report.  \n \n9.3.1  Issues related to the quality and use of isinglass\n \n \n• How will the isinglass manufacturing standard be monitored? \n \n• Isinglass could be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards. \n \nThere are a number of market factors that support the maintenance high quality of isinglass as \noutlined in Section 9.1.  \n \nDue to these factors FSANZ considers market imperatives will serve to maintain the \nprovision of high quality product and it is unlikely that isinglass in commercial quantities \nwould be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards.  This process \nwill inherently be self monitored by industry and its use of product.   \n \n• Impose a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing \nprotocol, is sourced and used. \n \nOnly trace amounts of parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass (from 1µg/g for the new \nprotocol to 10 µg/g for the traditional method). For consumers, exposure to isinglass in the \nfined beverage (bottled beer and wine) is unlikely to be more than 1 mg/L regardless of \nwhich protocol was used to prepare the isinglass. This aspect is already regulated in the Code \n(Standard 1.3.3) for the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent. Accordingly, consumer \nexposure to parvalbumin would be in nanogram levels regardless of whether the isinglass \nmanufacturing protocol is old or new. In addition, the oral challenge studies discussed in this \nreport indicate that isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol (up to 20 mg and \n50 mg, respectively) did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the fish-allergic participants. \n \nTherefore, imposing a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new \nmanufacturing protocol is sourced and used is unjustifiable. Including provisions for \nmanufacturing to the new protocol would be unenforceable.  \n  \n 23\n9.3.2 An alternative approach to declaring isinglass \n \n• If beer and wine industry’s concern is the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not \npermit the use of the term ‘isinglass’? \n \nThis Application deals specifically with the labelling requirements for mandatory allergen \ndeclarations. The available scientific evidence shows that isinglass is not likely to cause an \nallergic reaction to fish-allergic consumers. Therefore, FSANZ considers the current \nrequirement for the mandatory declaration of isinglass on product labels of beer and wine is \nnot warranted regardless of how it may be worded.  \n \n9.3.3 Review procedures \n \n• Regular reviews should be undertaken and if reactions do start to occur, amendments to \nthe Code should be made. \n \nFSANZ can prepare a proposal to amend the Code based on emerging evidence, as \nappropriate. This would apply to any new evidence relevant to the allergenicity of isinglass \nwhen used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. \n \n9.3.4 Provision of information beyond allergenicity \n \n• Labelling is required for vegetarians and vegans, and for people with other ethical, \nreligious, environmental or personal reasons to make informed choices. \n \n• Removing the labelling requirement would breach current Australian and international \nlaw regarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans.  \n \n• Allowing an exemption for labelling would be misleading and deceptive as it does not \nprovide adequate information for consumers to make informed choices for example \nvegetarian/vegan consumers. \n \n• Manufacturers should be required to disclose every ingredient used in the production \nprocess for all foods. \n \nThe purpose of this Application is to seek an exemption from the labelling requirements of \nmandatory allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3. The purpose of allergen declarations is to \nprotect the health and safety of those individuals susceptible to adverse reactions from certain \nfoods or substances in foods. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of isinglass-fined \nbeer and wine, is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers. \nTherefore providing an exemption would enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity \ninformation, to enable fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. Maintaining the \nstatus quo on the basis of the consequential use of allergen labelling by vegetarian and vegan \nconsumers to make informed choices goes beyond the scope of this Application.  \n \nIn Australia and New Zealand food manufacturers have the option of providing the food \nsuitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans on the label on a voluntary basis and \nmay do so as a customer service and to meet the consumer needs. Where manufacturers \nchoose to make a voluntary claim of this type, the general provisions in food law and fair \ntrading law as they relate to misleading or deceptive conduct, apply.   \n 24\nFurthermore, if the food suitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans is not \nprovided on the label of packaged foods, the supplier can be contacted to obtain this \ninformation. Standard 1.2.2 of the Code requires the name and address of the supplier to be \nlisted on the label, and many suppliers provide a free call telephone number on their labels. \nAdditionally, information from several sources such as websites and advocacy groups are \nalso available to assist vegetarian and vegan consumers.     \n \nA requirement to label packaged foods to enable vegetarians to make informed choices is the \nsubject of a separate Application (A545 – Vegetarian labelling), currently being considered \nby FSANZ. \n \nThere is no requirement in the Code to declare non-allergenic processing aids in the label. \nSpecifically, clause 3 of Standard 1.2.4 does not require the declaration of a substance (other \nthan those mentioned in Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3) used as a processing aid in \naccordance with Standard 1.3.3. As such, other animal-derived clarifying agents are not \nrequired to be labelled. This approach is consistent with ingredient labelling requirements \ninternationally. \n \n10. Options \n \nAt Final Assessment two options are presented for addressing this Application: \n \n10.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application \n \nReject the Application, thus maintaining the status quo – this would not allow the exemption \nfrom the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present in beer and wine as a \nresult of its use as a clarifying agent.  \n \n10.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  \n \nPrepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of the Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the \nrequirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its \nuse as a clarifying agent. \n  \n11. Impact Analysis \n \n11.1 Affected parties \n \nThe parties likely to be affected by this Application and preferred approach include: \n \n• Consumers of beer and wine who are allergic to fish; \n \n• Industry – Australian and New Zealand manufacturers and importers of beer and wine \nand isinglass manufacturers and distributors supplying to the Australian and New \nZealand markets ; and  \n \n• Government, including the enforcement agencies of Australia States/Territories and \nNew Zealand. \n  \n 25\n11.2 Benefit Cost Analysis \n \nThe Benefit Cost Analysis assesses the immediate and potential impacts of each regulatory \noption on the affected parties. \n \n11.2.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application \n \nUnder this Option, the status quo would be maintained and the Code would not be amended \nto allow the exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in \nbeer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent.  \n \n11.2.1.1 Benefits and Costs \n \n \nIt is unlikely that maintaining the status quo will greatly impact the identified parties.  As \nbeer and wine will continue to be produced and consumed in the current environment, there \nwill be no additional benefits or costs to consumers, industry and government. \n \n11.2.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  \n \n11.2.2.1 Benefits\n \n \nIndustry  \n \nGranting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in \nbeer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, provides the following potential \nbenefits: \n \n• provides industry with an additional choice of clarifying agent that does not require an \nallergen declaration, therefore, providing greater technical flexibility without creating \nnegative consumer perceptions. FSANZ has been made aware that although isinglass is \nconsidered a superior clarifying agent, the brewing industry does not currently use \nisinglass due to the mandatory declaration requirement.  \n \n• industry will be able to use isinglass without incurring allergen labelling costs. \n \n• beer and wine manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand currently supplying the \nlocal as well as labelling exempted export markets will not be required to provide \nseparate labelling. Similarly wine and beer imported from the labelling exempted \ncountries would not require additional labelling.  This reduces costs and enables \nmanufacturers to compete more effectively in the global environment.  \n \nConsumers \n \n• Removing the requirement to declare isinglass should minimise the confusion between \nperceived and actual risk and contribute positively to a more accurate assessment of \nproducts among fish-allergic consumers.  \n \n• Generally, fish-allergic consumers will benefit in terms of increased choice of beer and \nwine products.  \n  \n 26\nGovernment \n \n• Enforcement agencies would no longer be required to enforce the mandatory allergen \ndeclaration for isinglass.  \n \n• Since this amendment is not likely to present a health and safety risk to fish-allergic \nconsumers the health care expenditure of government will not be impacted.  \n \n• There may be further enhancement in consumer confidence in the regulatory system as \na consequence of the improved accuracy in product allergenicity information due to the \nproposed changes. Enforcement agencies may benefit from this increase in consumer \nconfidence.  \n \n11.2.2.2 Costs\n \n \nIndustry  \n \n• As the use of isinglass in beer and wine would be a voluntary choice and does not incur \nadditional labelling, no additional costs would be imposed on industry. \n \n• Submissions from industry did not identify any added costs.  \n \nConsumers \n \n• Consumers will continue to have a broad choice in terms of quality and price points \nacross the range of beer and wine in the market place.  \n \n• Consumers are not expected to incur additional costs.  \n \nGovernment \n \n• There are no expected costs to government as a result of this amendment to the Code.  \n \n11.3 Comparison of options \n \nOptions 1 and 2 would continue to protect the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers of \nbeer and wine clarified using isinglass. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of \nisinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic \nconsumers.  \nOption 2 will provide fish-allergic consumers with an increased choice of beer and wine \nproducts, and enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity information, to enable fish-\nallergic consumers to make an informed choice. This option will also provide the industry \nwith greater technical flexibility and ease the presence of international trade obstacles due to \ndifferent labelling requirements. \n \nOverall, a comparison of the options at Final Assessment suggests Option 2 provides greater \nnet benefit to the affected parties.  \n  \n 27\nCOMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY \n \n12. Consultation \n \n12.1 Public consultation \n \n12.1.1 Initial Assessment \n \nThe Initial Assessment Report for Application A490 was advertised for public comment from \n5 October to 16 November 2005. In response, FSANZ received twenty submissions, with \neleven submissions from industry, six from government, and three from consumers. \n \nOverall, eleven of the submitters provided support for the exemption, six objected to \nproviding an exemption and one did not provide a preferred option. Of the remaining two \nsubmitters, one indicated cautious support awaiting results of the safety assessment. The \nother indicated support based on a condition that only isinglass derived from the swim \nbladders of (tropical and subtropical) fish should be exempt.  \n \n12.1.2 Draft Assessment \n \nAt Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public \nhealth and safety implications of this Application. The Draft Assessment Report was \nadvertised for public comment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. In response, FSANZ \nreceived twenty-seven submissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from \nindustry, two from government and one from a public health organisation. \n \nOverall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to \nproviding an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption.  Of the \nremaining two submitters, one indicated support, in principle, for granting exemptions from \nmandatory labelling of ingredients derived from allergenic sources.  However, with regard to \nisinglass this submitter expressed concern that the evidence did not indicate that there is no \nrisk.  This submitter was also concerned as to how the manufacturing standard that minimises \nthe level of parvalbumin in isinglass will be monitored, and the possible supply of isinglass in \nthe marketplace from a manufacturer with less stringent manufacturing standards. \n \nThe other indicated support based on a condition that FSANZ consider making it a \nrequirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of parvalbumin be exempt \nfrom allergen declaration for isinglass.  \n \nA significant proportion of submitters that objected to providing an exemption linked their \narguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information \nrelating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. \nThe requirement to declare isinglass was considered as enabling consumers to make informed \nchoices about foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons. In \naddition, the majority of submitters from this group indicated that they were either a \nvegetarian or vegan or support the provision of information on this basis.  \n \nThere were two submitters who objected to providing an exemption since they believe they \nhad experienced an allergic reaction from consuming wine.  \n  \n 28\nA summary of submissions to the Draft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. \n \n12.2 Targeted consultation \n \nThe Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director of \nthe Allergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Rob Loblay endorsed the \nFSANZ preferred regulatory approach.  \n \nFollowing an assessment of the comments received to the Draft Assessment Report, targeted \nconsultations with submitters on specific issues were conducted. These targeted consultations \nincluded contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an allergic reaction \nin response to consuming wine.  \n \n12.3 World Trade Organization \n \nAs members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Australia and New Zealand are \nobligated to notify WTO member nations, where proposed mandatory regulatory measures \nare inconsistent with any existing or imminent international standards and the proposed \nmeasure may have a significant effect on trade. \n \nThe proposed permission has already been granted in some international markets and \nproducts with similar allergen labelling exemptions are marketed internationally. FSANZ \nconsiders providing an exemption will further reduce variations between countries and \nfacilitate international trade. This position is supported by domestic and international \nsubmitters from the industry. \n \nTherefore at Draft Assessment, FSANZ considered it was not necessary to notify WTO \nmember nations of the proposed amendment under either the Technical Barriers to Trade or \nthe Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreements. \n \n13. Communication Strategy \n \nSubmissions indicated support from industry for the proposed labelling exemption. However \na significant proportion of other submitters objected to the proposed exemption. The \nobjection was based on the provision of information with a particular focus on \nvegetarianism/veganism which is beyond the scope of this Application.  \n \nAfter considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ completed \ntargeted consultations to clarify some of the issues raised by submitters. These targeted \nconsultations included contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an \nallergic reaction in response to consuming wine.  \n \nIssues raised by submitters have been considered and addressed as part of the Final \nAssessment. Should this standard be amended, FSANZ will work closely with Anaphylaxis \nAustralia and Allergy New Zealand on messages to inform their members that this measure is \nsafe and supported by themselves and allergy specialists. A fact sheet will be placed on the \nFSANZ website. \n  \n 29\nCONCLUSION \n \n14. Conclusion and Decision \n \nDecision \n \nFSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant \nan exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in \nbeer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. \n \nFSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant \nexemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and \nwine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: \n \n• does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers  \n \n• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the \ninformation related to the allergenicity of the product. \n \n• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products \n \n• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen \ndeclaration \n \n• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass \non the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, \nprovides a net benefit to affected parties. \n \nThe draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. \n \n15. Implementation and Review \n \nThe FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food \nRegulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). \n \nSubject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to \ngrant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer \nand wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal. \n \nATTACHMENTS \n \n1. Draft variation to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code  \n2. Summary of Submissions to the Draft Assessment Report \n3. Risk Assessment Report \n4. Food Technology Report \n \n  \n 30\nAttachment 1 \n \nDraft Variation to the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code \n \nStandards or variations to standards are considered to be legislative instruments for the \npurposes of the Legislative Instruments Act (2003) and are not subject to disallowance or \nsunsetting. \n \nTo commence: on gazettal \n \n[1] Standard 1.2.3 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code is varied by \nomitting from the Table to clause 4, the entry for Fish and fish products, substituting – \n \nFish and fish products, except for isinglass derived from swim bladders and used as a clarifying agent in beer \nand wine. \n  \n 31\nAttachment 2 \n \nAPPLICATION A490 – EXEMPTION OF ALLERGEN DECLARATION FOR ISINGLASS \nSummary of Submissions on the Draft Assessment Report  \n \nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nAB Vickers Industry • Supports the Application. \n• The robust and comprehensive risk assessment conducted by FSANZ has taken into consideration the best \nscientific evidence that is now available concerning the allergenic potential of isinglass. \n• Until quite recently, a lack of scientific evidence had made it difficult to substantiate any claims regarding the \nlikely risk to fish-allergic consumers consuming beverages in which isinglass had been used. Previously, the \nstrongest argument in favour on non-labelling was that isinglass had a long history of safe use without a single \nrecorded incident of allergic reaction. \n• The scientific studies in the Draft Assessment Report have now confirmed that any residual levels of isinglass \nthat may be present are extremely low, if present at all. \n• Clinical trials have further demonstrated that isinglass does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive \nindividuals at far higher exposure rates than would be encountered in beers and wines. \n• The isinglass exemption will allow fish sensitive consumers to make informed choices concerning beverage \nconsumption and will allow consumers a wider choice of beverages though the removal of a precautionary-\nbased label approach. \n• The brewing and winemaking industries will also benefit from this exemption through increased flexibility of \nchoice in processing (clarifying) aids and isinglass producers will benefit through the increased opportunity to \ntrade with Australian and New Zealand beer and wine producers. \n• The Draft Assessment Report acknowledges the regulatory approach to allergen labelling of isinglass in \nseveral countries where labelling exemption has already been granted. An exemption for isinglass in Australia \nand New Zealand will contribute to increased confidence in allergen labelling statements for those consumers \nwho travel globally. \n• A consistency in allergen labelling declarations will benefit beverage manufacturers through simplification of \nlabelling strategies and will also benefit isinglass manufacturers who will be able to trade freely with beverage \ncompanies.  \n 32\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nAustralian Food and \nGrocery Council \n(AFGC) \nIndustry • Supports the Application. \n• Where there is little clinical evidence of allergic reaction and there is a low risk that the substances are \ncapable of inducing an allergic response at the concentrations present in the final product, then the product \nshould be exempt from mandatory allergen labelling requirements. \n• The AFGC supports the requirement for allergen labelling and the need to inform consumers, and supports the \nFSANZ assessment that isinglass-fined beer and wine, are not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in \nfish-allergic consumers. \n• However, the AFGC notes the work being undertaken by FSANZ to review the entire standard, and that the \nprinciples and assumptions on which the standard is based need to be reassessed, in line with this \nrecommendation.  Such an assessment would provide a comprehensive reassessment of exemptions to \nallergen labelling, rather than dealing with exemptions in a piece-meal approach. \nBrewers Association of \nAustralia & New \nZealand \nIndustry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: \n• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to \nconsumers. \n• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the \nbeer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. \n• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. \n• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material \nwhich is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. \n• Where isinglass is not used because of such labelling requirements, the increased unnecessary costs to the \nconsumer and the environment resulting from increased filter powder usage. \n• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label. \n• The new and standardised process for isinglass production. \n• In this case, the requirement to label for the presence of isinglass results in misleading information being \nprovided to the consumer.  \n 33\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nFood Technology \nAssociation of Australia \nIndustry  • The Technical Sub-Committee agreed with option 2 for the exemption of allergen declaration for isinglass, \nhowever, after much debate also considered the following: \n- Beer and wine had been again exempt from another labelling requirement required on all other foods, the \nrationale for which is still unclear to other food manufacturers as alcohol is no less a nutrient than any \nother of the specified nutrients and alcoholic beverages are part of the average diet of many consumers. \n- Is this application the beginning of similar requests for allergen exempt labelling from other \nmanufacturers? \n- It is understood that egg white (albumen) is also used as a clarifying/fining agent in some sectors of the \nwine industry and the labelling of this possible allergen has not yet been discussed. \nFoster’s Group Industry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: \n• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to \nconsumers. \n• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the \nbeer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. \n• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. \n• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material \nwhich is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. \n• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label. \n• The new and standardised process for isinglass production.  \n 34\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nInter-Industry Coalition: \n- Brewers Association \n- Distilled Spirits \nCouncil of the \nUnited States \n- National Association \nof Beverage \nImporters \n- Presidents’ Forum \n- WineAmerica \n- Wine Institute \nIndustry • Fully supports the Application. \n• Any labelling for food allergens must take into account whether or not that food will produce an allergic \nreaction and that labelling for all allergen levels may lead to further restricted diets, increased frustration and \nrisk-taking and undermining the integrity of labelling statements. \n• Consumers need to trust that allergen labelling information is reliable and not be subjected to misleading, \nprecautionary statements that may be ignored based upon, for example, prior experience consuming the food \nproduct in question without an adverse reaction. \n• A robust, scientifically based labelling allergen schema, which properly identifies those products containing \nallergenic protein likely to cause adverse reaction, will provide consumers with beneficial, non-misleading \ninformation.  The exemption of isinglass meets and serves these interests. \n• With a global economy and free travel among consumers, determinations made by respective government \nbodies about allergen labelling should not impede trade without serving a public interest. The applicability of \nan allergen labelling requirement for a particular product should be the same from one country to another.  \nConsumers will benefit from meaningful allergen labelling statements they can rely upon to make food \nchoices whether they are a resident or visiting a particular country. The exemption of isinglass meets these \ngoals.  \n 35\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nNew Zealand \nWinegrowers (NZW) \nIndustry • Supports the Application, based on the information presented in their submission of 16 November 2005 and \nthe additional findings of the Report (submission lists Draft Assessment Report findings). \nHistory of Non-Allergenicity \n• To date, not aware of any incident of a consumer ever having suffered an allergic reaction due to the use of \nisinglass in wine. Nor has any such incident been relayed to NZW from relevant New Zealand health \nauthorities.  The absence of any reported allergic reactions was also noted in the EFSA report. \nUsage in New Zealand \n• The average level of isinglass addition in New Zealand is approximately 0.05-0.25 g/L.  Isinglass is used \nsparingly as it is one of the most expensive fining agents available. Both the Draft Assessment Report and the \nAustralian Wine Institute submission note that isinglass is not intended to be in the final product and any \nresidue is likely to be negligible due to the filtering and racking processes. \nBenefits to New Zealand Producers if Exemption is Granted \n• New Zealand and Australia are the only major wine producing countries in the world that require an allergen \ndeclaration if isinglass is used in the production of wine. In addition to the concerns of the potential for the \nrequirement to create a trade barrier, it is also relevant to consider the unfairness which arises as a result of \nimporter non-compliance. Mandatory label statements on all New Zealand wine are verified by the producer’s \ncompliance with the Wine Act 2003.  No such system applies to imported wine, many of which bear no \nallergy statement and due to difficulty detecting isinglass residues in wine, it is very likely that a proportion of \nthese will have been made using undeclared isinglass. If the exemption is granted, the negative consumer \nperceptions associated with the declaration of fish products will be removed and compliant producers can \ncompete on a level playing field with non-compliant users of isinglass. \n• The exemption of isinglass labelling will also: \n- give wine producers the option to choose the best quality clarification option without losing consumer \nconfidence; \n- increase consumer choice for consumers who suffer from fish allergies, and \n- reduce costs by removing the need to produce different labels for different vintages and batches or for \nexport markets which do not require the declaration of isinglass. \n• A considerable body of evidence and international research supports the key findings of the Draft Assessment \nReport that isinglass raises no safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers when present in wine and beer.  \n 36\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nThe Allergen Bureau Industry • Supports the Application. \n• Considers that the risk to allergic consumers from the consumption of wine and beer treated with isinglass is \nvery low, that advisory allergen labelling for the presence of fish does not constitute an effective risk \nmanagement strategy and that the proposed exemption from labelling is justified. \n• Labelling of allergens represents a risk management strategy intended to inform potentially allergic \nconsumers to the presence of a hazard in food and thereby enable them to make appropriate food choices. In \norder for this strategy to be effective, the information provided must be understood by, and relevant to, the \nconsumer. Where labelling accurately advises of the presence of an identified allergen, the use of such \nlabelling provides useful information to the consumer. However, the use of allergen advisory labelling in \nrelation to a food component that does not contain the allergen moiety devalues the benefit of allergen \nlabelling. This unnecessarily limits consumer choice and is likely to confuse consumers and can potentially be \nmisunderstood or ignored. \n• This recommendation is consistent with the recent conclusion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, \nNutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that ‘it is not very likely that isinglass \nused as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a sever allergic reactions in susceptible individuals’ (reference \nprovided). \n• As identified by FSANZ, the major components of isinglass are type 1 collagen, gelatin and small quantities \nof elastin.  The Bureau is not aware of evidence to suggest that these components are clinically relevant to fish \nallergies.   \n• The level of parvalbumins in isinglass is reported in the EFSA evaluation and the FSANZ Draft Assessment \nReport to be very low, in the range 1-34 ppm. The introduction of a modified preparation procedure for \nisinglass has the potential to yield concentrations up to 10-fold lower and consistently below 1 ppm. \n• During the development of the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) procedure for \nlabelling of the presence of cross-contact allergens in food, the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels \n(LOAEL) for total fish protein of 1-100 mg were identified (reference provided). The lower end of this range \nwas used in establishing the first action levels. At this level, subjective responses such as numbness or pruritis \nat the site of contact or general uneasiness may be reported by sensitive individuals, although these cannot be \nverified by observers in clinical studies.  The first VITAL action level separates Action Level 1 at which it is \nconsidered a precautionary advisory statement is not required and Action Level 2 at which a precautionary \nadvisory statement is required. In another comparison of clinical studies, the lowest reported provoking dose \nwas identified as 5 mg (reference provided). Based on parvalbumin concentration in fish muscle of 4000 g/g \nor 0.4% (reference provided), a consumer would need to drink unrealistic amounts of beer (80 L of cask beer \nor 200L of packaged beer) to consume an amount of parvalbumin consistent with exposure to 1 mg total \nprotein, that at which only mild subjective reactions are observed in clinical trials. \n  \n 37\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nNew Zealand Food \nSafety Authority \n(NZFSA) \nGovernment • Supports option 2 for the exemption of isinglass subject to the following condition: \n• FSANZ should consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of \nparvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration for isinglass. This could be achieved, for example, through \nan industry guideline or Code of Practice, requiring wine and beer manufacturers to comply with the ‘new \ncode of GMP’ (Good Manufacturing Practice) for the sourcing and use of isinglass as outlined in the Report. \nReasons for suggesting a condition \n• The Report states that the three major European manufacturers of isinglass have developed a common code of \nGMP for the sourcing and manufacturing of isinglass (‘new code of GMP’) to reduce the parvalbumin content \nin isinglass. The Report also states that the Application claims that nearly 100% of the isinglass used in New \nZealand and Australia is sourced from these three manufacturers. NZFSA is concerned that ‘nearly all’ is not \nALL, therefore, some isinglass used in the production of wine and beer in New Zealand and Australia is not \nsourced from the three European manufacturers using the ‘new code of GMP’. There is also no guarantee that \nimported wines use isinglass manufactured to this new Code.  Isinglass not manufactured under the ‘new code \nof GMP’ is considered to contain higher levels of parvalbumin and therefore, puts fish-allergic consumers at a \nhigher risk of having an allergic reaction. \nAdditional Comments on the Draft Assessment Report \nCorrect use of the term GMP \n• Throughout the report the term GMP has been incorrectly referred to as Good Management Practice.  The \nterm GMP applies to Good Manufacturing Practice which is a different practice to Good Management \nPractice. \nRisk Assessment \n• Agrees with the conclusion in the FSANZ risk assessment that if industry uses isinglass prepared under the \nindustry agreed GMP, then the risk of exposure to fish allergens is expected to be extremely low. \n• Some concerns in relation to the evidence supplied by the applicant on which this risk assessment was based \nand asks that these be addressed in the Final Assessment Report. These same concerns were raised in the \nOpinions of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety \nAuthority (the Panel): \n- While there have been few if any documented reports of adverse events that can be attributed to fish \nallergy from consuming wine or beer fined with isinglass, it should be noted that there could be a \nsignificant underreporting of reactions because it is uncertain whether wine drinkers and health \nprofessionals have been aware of the possible presence of fish proteins in wine.  \n- The literature review was based on one search engine and used only two search terms.  The Panel noted \ncertain limitations associated with the restricted search strategy used. This would not support the statement \nin the Report that a comprehensive literature search was undertaken.  \n 38\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \n- The Panel noted that there were ‘uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod \nparvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass’.  \nTherefore, testing for residual isinglass should be treated with caution. \n- The results of the clinical studies need to be treated with caution as the test numbers are small and \ntherefore, have limited statistical power. \n- One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed potatoes. The Panel \nnoted that this trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually consumed. In addition \nit noted that alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food allergic reaction in susceptible \nindividuals. \n- The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-allergenicity.  The \nPanel noted that this method is ‘unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass’. Whilst most known \nallergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a necessary condition for allergenicity. \nSummary \n• Notes that the Panel took a cautious approach when presenting its opinions on the isinglass exemption, \nparticularly where there was insufficient information available on which to base an opinion. Despite this a \npermanent exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in both beer and wine was granted in 2007. \n• Assume that the evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under the new \ncode of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in the Report. Asks that FSANZ \nprovide the scientific evidence in the Final Assessment Report that would support this extrapolation. Without \nthis evidence believes there is a sound basis to impose the condition with regulatory option 2 as proposed by \nNZFSA.  \n• Essential that regular reviews are undertaken and if necessary, amendments are made, especially if reactions \ndo start to occur. \nQueensland Health Government • Does not support the Application. \n• Response made by Queensland Health representing whole of Queensland Government. \n• Need to err on the side of caution particularly where in relation to the following key assessment findings: \n- ‘parvalbumin is….possibly the sole allergen for most individuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish’ \n- ‘the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new protocol has been shown to be \nextremely low…’ \n- ‘a significant amount of isinglass introduced in beer and wine is removed allowing only a residual amount \nof isinglass to remain…’ \n- ‘parvalbumin….is unlikely  to be present in the bulk of beer or wine….’ \n  \n 39\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \n- ‘the residual amounts of isinglass that are shown to remain in beer and wine are well below the isinglass \ndosage used in oral challenge tests…’ \n• Notes the Codex general standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods. The list of food allergens that are \nrequired to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’. There are no exemptions to these labelling \nrequirements. In addition, there are variations in approaches between countries. \n• In addition, ‘the data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand populations and the \nthreshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are unknown’ (Report, p22). \n• There would be a significant under-reporting of reactions (if any) against the substances in wine, as most wine \ndrinkers and health professionals are probably unaware of the possible presence of isinglass. They would most \nlikely blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse reactions occurred. \n• Dr Andreas Lopata from the Allergy Research Group at RMIT University stated in an ABC radio interview on \nThursday, 2 October 2008 that, ‘It is not really known if isinglass itself actually can cause an anaphylactic \nreaction in fish-allergic people. The major allergens in fish are normally found in the flesh of the fish but in \nsome rare cases also collagen can cause allergies. And isinglass contains this particular collagen which is \nfound in fish so theoretically it can cause in select individuals….an anaphylactic reaction.’ \n• The first of the reasons for preferred approach by FSANZ to grant an exemption is that it ‘does not raise any \nsafety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.’ However, the second objective for the assessment of the \napplication is to ‘ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergenic to \nfish.’ Is there any reason why only safety is referred to in the reasons for preferred approach? \n• Allowing an exemption will undermine the provision of adequate information on the product label to make an \ninformed choice by vegetarians and vegans who will find the ‘extremely low’ levels of isinglass present in \nbeer and wine as unsuitable for vegetarian diets. \n• Research commissioned by the Sanitarium Health Food Company in 2000 found 2% of Australians reported \nbeing vegetarian. \n• It is of little use in addressing the vegetarian/vegan issue by stating ‘FSANZ is considering Application A545 \non vegetarian labelling.’ The Work Plan on FSANZ website notes that it was received on 23 August 2004, \nstarting in 4th quarter of 2006 and initial assessment to the Board in February 2009. Accordingly, clarification \nis requested. \n• It is disappointing that FSANZ chose not to show this cost in the benefit cost analysis since the issue of \nvegetarian labelling was identified following the release of the Initial Assessment Report. \n• Resources across government, industry and other stakeholders could be better utilised if the issue of allergen \ndeclaration generally was addressed at one time rather than by a ‘case-by-case’ type basis.  \n 40\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nAllergy New Zealand Public Health • Supports, in-principle, the granting of exemptions of mandatory labelling, as long as there is undisputed \nevidence that the ingredient: \n- is proven to be clinically safe for all individuals allergic to that allergen, and \n- has been manufactured to strict standards that are monitored and assured by the regulatory authority who \nhas granted the exemption. \n• Concerned that there is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass ‘does not raise any safety concerns for fish-\nallergic consumers’ as stated in FSANZ’s reasons for preferred approach.   \n• Accepts that evidence to date indicates that isinglass-fined beer and wine are not likely to present a risk of \nallergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, however, this does not indicate that there is no risk. \n• The FSANZ report states that there are no documented reports of allergic reactions to beer or wine fined \nisinglass in fish-allergic consumers. However, many food-allergic reactions are never reported to an authority \nor medical practitioner. Furthermore, there is no requirement in New Zealand for food-allergic reactions to be \nreported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the reaction in a published journal.  \nTherefore, questions the safety of this being used as evidence of no risk. \n• Two areas of concern regarding the manufacturers of isinglass and use in the wine and beer industry: \n- how will the manufacturing standard be monitored, and \n- wine and beer manufacturers may source isinglass from another manufacturer in a country with less \nstringent manufacturing standards. \n• Fish-allergic individuals are entitled to make an informed choice. \n• If beer and wine industry’s concern is borne out of the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not permit the \nuse of the term ‘isinglass’? This will only be of concern to those consumers who are allergic to fish, who \nwould then be advised to avoid products using isinglass. \n• With ongoing research internationally, the situation may become a lot clearer in regard to the risks to fish-\nallergic consumers of isinglass-fined wine and beer. It is therefore recommended that FSANZ, in whatever \ndecision it takes in regard to this Application, undertakes to review it within 5 years, or sooner if clearer \nevidence becomes available.  \n 41\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nDaniel Beecher Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• FSANZ legally required to act in consistency with Australian and international law, regardless of the limited \nscope of Application A490.  As such, despite being beyond the scope of the application, the following \nobjections are immediately relevant to FSANZ’s review of Application A490, since they are directly relevant \nto the legality of FSANZ’s proposed outcome. \n• FSANZ’s reasons are irrelevant to the issues raised in this submission. The relevant facts are: \n1.  that the previous decision was the only legally valid decision that FSANZ could make, and \n2.  that FSANZ would be breaking the law by overturning the previous decision \n3.  any past oversights of FSANZ’s legal responsibilities should not be used as an excuse for making further \nbreaches of Australian law \n• For FSANZ to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass would be a breach of current Australian law \nregarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans. Particularly human rights and anti discrimination laws, \nstatutory bills of rights, and UN conventions. \n• The onus is now upon FSANZ to immediately consider the impact of their actions (such as the proposed \napproval of Application A490) upon the legally protected human rights of vegetarians and vegans. As such, \nthe submitter formally requests that FSANZ immediately desist from approving the Application, or from \nmaking any other decisions that allow food manufacturers to reduce or remove the capacity of vegetarians or \nvegans to be aware of animal derived ingredients within foodstuffs. \n• The submission provides references (available upon request) to current law that would be contravened if \nFSANZ were to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass. \nLinda Cuthbertson Consumer • Does not support the Application as a vegetarian. \n• In order to select wine, the label is checked for fish products and bottles are excluded that fits that category. \n• It is becoming increasingly difficult to find wines that do not include fish products but the statement on the \nlabel enables wines to be chosen that are suitable for vegetarians. \n• It would be more useful if the label was more specific; the words ‘may contain’ are somewhat vague. \n• The warning should be retained for dietary purposes so that vegetarians are able to select wines that have no \nfish content.  \n 42\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nEmma Delaney Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• As a vegan, relies on labels being truthful to make an informed decision. If not informed of a particular \ningredient, such as a fish product, it is not clear if the product is vegan. \n• The ingredient could cause an allergic response in some individuals, even if reaction may only be mild it \nshould be up to the individual with the allergy to decide if they are going to take the risk, not up to companies \nwho do not want to lose profits. \n• The consumer deserves to know exactly what it is that they are consuming whether they avoid certain \ningredients due to ethical reasons, health reason or other reasons.  \n• If fish products are taken off beer and wine labels, the submitter will no longer try new wines as will not be \nable to trust that the label is truthful and the only choice will be to assume that fish has been used. Therefore, \nthe submitter will only buy wines that are labelled as vegan. This will affect the consumer and the profits of \nthe companies involved. Consumers with an allergy to fish would make a similar decision.  \nLynsey Edgar Consumer • Does not support the Application as a wine consumer who is very allergic to fish. \n• Suffered an allergic reaction 6 months ago and another time subsequently whilst drinking white wine. On both \noccasions, the label indicated that fish products were used in the clarifying process. \n• If exemption is permitted, it will be impossible for consumers to determine if fish products are present. How \nare consumers who are allergic to fish, ever to be sure they will not experience a reaction to white wine?  \nInformation on the label is the only way to be sure, prior to drinking wine, that the consumer will not \nexperience an allergic reaction. \n• Consumers are entitled to full disclosure of the food products used in producing wine, to make an informed \ndecision, particularly where the decision can affect their health. \n• If exemption allowed, the consumer will have to maintain own ‘safe’ list of wines that they can consume. This \nwill curtail purchasing choices as they will not stray from list of known, non-allergy inducing wines. \nEleanor Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Sister ate a fish that contained an almost lethal dose of ciguatera toxin. She was hospitalised and semi-\nconscious for a week and not mentally herself for 6 months following. 10 years later she experienced another \nreaction from paper handled by another person who had eaten fish and continues to get these types of \nreactions from other people who have handled fish. The toxin firstly stops her thinking but still functioning \nand then stops her functioning. Therefore, anything that contains fish derived items should be labelled for the \nwellbeing of all.  \n 43\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nDiane Francis Consumer • Does not support the Application.   \n• As a vegetarian, does not consume fish and therefore, relies on correct labelling of food and beverage \nproducts. \n• Why should wine be exempt from responsible labelling? \nRon Hewit Consumer • Does not support the Application due to vegan interests. \n• The exemption of isinglass labelling in wines will prevent people not wishing to eat fish products from \nconsuming any wine as they cannot tell from the label. \n• Labels must state if traces of egg whites are used (as opposed to bentonite or similar clarifiers), so there \nshould not be any exemption for fish products.  \n• Other foodstuffs from soups, biscuits and noodles must state if fish or crustacea are included in the product. \nThis permits a choice for those who do not wish to consume these products whether for allergenic, religious, \nhealth, or animal welfare reasons.  \n• Without the isinglass labels, wine that does not include this product will be penalised because some people \nwill not purchase any wine for fear of unlabelled isinglass traces.  \n• It seems a poor reason to request an exemption just because wine makers don’t wish to include a fish product \nlabel.   \n• All foodstuffs should be labelled with all products, it helps indicate the cleanliness and purity of the \nmanufacturing process; traces of unpleasant products should be declared, people need the choice.  \nRuth Jackson Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Removing isinglass from labelling will not allow consumers to make informed choices about purchasing beer \nand wine.  \n• Ethics in business is not fundamentally a question of whether it is right or wrong to tell the truth…rather \nethics in business is fundamentally a question of implementing and maintaining communication systems \nwhich question, discuss and validate ethical claims.  \n• Exempting isinglass from labelling effectively takes away the ability of each individual to judge for \nthemselves whether they want to consume a product that contains fish. It is misleading or deceptive because it \ndoes not provide adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices.  \n• Submitter does not want to drink beer or wine with fish products, so the only option would be to stop drinking \nalcoholic products unless know they do not contain isinglass.  \n• It is honest to label what is in a product, no matter how minute it is.  \n 44\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nLynda Kriflik Consumer • Does not support the Application for vegetarian/vegan interests. \n• The removal of notification of isinglass in wines is problematic for another group of consumers other than \nthose that suffer allergies. Consumers who choose not to eat or intake animal products will be severely \ndisadvantaged by the removal of warnings indicating that isinglass was used as the refining agent.  \n• Failure to advise consumers of the refining agent is inadequate ‘provision on the product label to make \ninformed choices’ by any consumers. \n• Vegetarians/vegans use label information to avoid products that contain rennet or gelatin, both animal \nproducts, and expect that labels would also allow them to avoid fish products, regardless of the quantity, as \nthey choose not to include any ‘fellow creatures’ in their diet.  \n• Submitter has contacted several viniculturalists to express concern that such advice is an ethical recognition of \nthe right to choose dietary intake. \nLefki Pavlidis Consumer • Strongly disagrees with the Application.  \n• Wishes to know all the ingredients contained in any product for human consumption. \n• The small traces of fish in beer & wine may or may not cause allergic reactions in people with fish allergies, \nbut FSANZ must also consider the many people who choose not to consume anything that contains animal \ningredients for ethical reasons.  \n• Manufacturers should be up-front and provide a full list of ingredients used in the production of their \nproducts, so consumers can make the right purchasing decisions according to ethical beliefs. \nKathryn Puxty Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Labelling is essential for vegetarians and vegans to be able to make an informed decision about which wines \nthey can and can't drink to follow their chosen diet. Whether or not there are significant traces remaining in \nthe wine is irrelevant. The fact that it has been produced using fish (or milk or eggs) is sufficient to make it \nunsuitable. If this exemption goes ahead then the range of wines that vegetarians and vegans can drink will be \ngreatly limited as we won't know what is suitable and what is not.  \n• If this exemption is granted then an acceptable, or perhaps preferable, alternative would be to make it \nmandatory to label all wines, or in fact all alcohol, as being suitable for vegetarians and vegans. This is \nsomething that many food brands currently do, though they are not obligated to do so.  \n• The wine industry is overreacting the negative reaction of general consumers to the labelling of fish products, \nsince rarely anyone ever reads the labels, and those that do are people with allergies or special diets that make \nlabel and ingredient checking a normal part of life. \n• If labelling is going to be insufficient then the only other option is to avoid products that we cannot be sure \nabout. This will also have a negative impact on many producers in the wine and alcohol industry.  \n 45\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nPenny Rankin Consumer • Does not support the Application as an allergy sufferer. \n• The argument that the amount of fish products in wine is so small they could not be harmful is not true. \n• Submitter experienced an allergic reaction after only 2 sips of wine containing fish products and seaweed and \nnow checks wine labels very carefully.  Submitter is dangerously allergic to seaweed which causes angio \noedema and can be fatal. \n• Need to ensure labels continue to list ingredients such as isinglass, fish products and seaweed, so allergy \nsufferers can avoid them and stay alive without requiring emergency tracheotomies. \nJessica Robinson Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• In the interests of both consumers who have, for ethical, religious, or personal reasons, an opposition to the \nuse of fish products in their consumables, and also the general public for the basic reason that every consumer \nhas a right to know exactly how a product has been produced.  \n• People who have adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet do not purchase beer or wine that has been brewed using \nisinglass. If there are no standards, these groups of people will not know which products are appropriate for \nthem, causing unnecessary stress, uncertainty and inconveniences. \n• Understands that the association has concerns that consumers may be put off purchasing a product if they read \nthat it has been produced using fish products. However, it is essentially the responsibility of the consumer to \neducate themselves in the process of beer and wine production, and omitting certain information from the \nlabels is insulting to the informed consumer and a tactical cover-up of the truth. It does not change the fact \nthat these products are used. If a consumer takes issue with the production process then they have the right to \nresearch and make an informed decision about where they place their purchasing power.  \n• It is quite clear that the driving force behind the application is the prospect of higher sales for the beer and \nwine industry, and accepting their proposal would mean sacrificing the moral duty of a producer of \nconsumables to be truthful. \nJohn Wakerman Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Whilst labelling may or may not be important for those with fish allergies, it is important for those who \nsimply wish to be informed about what they consume, in whatever concentration. Accurate labelling is also \nimportant for those with religious or other beliefs, be they Muslims or vegans.  \n• Where isinglass is used and residual is to be found in beers or wines, it should be thus labelled, regardless of \nallergenicity. Only thus will consumers be able to make informed choices and not be misled about the content \nof common foodstuffs or drinks.  \n 46\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nTara Ward Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Submission focuses on the objectives of FSANZ, specifically ‘the provision of adequate information relating \nto food to enable consumers to make informed choices’. \n• The focus of the application and Draft Assessment Report was limited to consumers of beer and wine who are \nallergic to fish.  This submission considers the impact on all consumers of beer and wine, rather than merely \nthose who are allergic to fish. \n• The requirement to declare isinglass on beer and wine labels allows consumers to make informed choices \nabout food based on political, religious and/or ethical preferences, including preferences not to purchase \nproducts made using animals or fish.   \n• To date, a major obstacle for consumers wishing to make informed food choices has been improper or \ninsufficient labelling. The preferred regulatory approach of granting the exemption will only exacerbate this \ntrend.  In the absence of mandatory labelling systems for products containing, or produced with, animal or \nfish products, this submission urges that exemption not be granted. \n• According to the Report, the requirement to declare the use of isinglass does not provide accurate information \nfor fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. It is difficult to understand how the declaration on a \nlabel of factual information regarding the production system associated with a product does not count as \n‘accurate’ information. \n• The mandatory requirement regarding isinglass is not to make assertions about the possibility of an allergic \nreaction to it, but merely to declare that it was used in the production of food in question.  Removing such \nfactual information would diminish the ability of consumers to make an informed choice, as it would conceal \nthe nature of the process used to produce the food. \n• Retaining the existing limitations of the requirement avoids the need to alter the information on labels \naccording to the changing nature of research findings regarding isinglass and/or the changing social \nconscience of consumers. \n• If there is concern about the general level of awareness regarding the potential (or lack thereof) for allergic \nreactions to isinglass, it would be better to continue the requirement to declare its use, and as well to provide \nadditional information on relevant websites and other sources. \n• Should the requirement to declare isinglass be removed, it would reduce choice for consumers who do not \nwish to buy wine or beer where it is unclear whether its production involved the use of isinglass. If consumers \nconcerned about the use of fish products were to cease purchasing wine or beer that does not declare the \npresence of isinglass, this may result in a cost to certain sectors of the industry.  \n 47\nSubmitter  Sector Comments \nSharnie Wu Consumer • Does not support the Application. \n• Submitter spoke to the allergy clinic at Royal Price Alfred Hospital since original submission, who suggested \nthat isinglass is not a major allergy threat. \n• Therefore, the main reason to label is the need for transparency for consumers who want to know what the \nproduct inputs are. Isinglass uses an animal product and consumers need to know this to make informed \nchoices with their purchase. \n• Many vegetarians and vegans would not buy these wines if they knew that fish had been killed in the process \nof making them. It is their right to know what they are buying. People have a fundamental civil right to know \nthe truth of what they are putting into their own bodies and make the appropriate decisions. \n• It is up to the wine industry to market appropriately to avoid the stigma of using fish products. \n• Also for consideration is the possible environmental impact of using isinglass. In this world of fish \npopulations being severely depleted by overfishing, climate change and ocean pollution, is it absolutely \nnecessary to use fish for an incremental gain in the taste of wine which the wine producers are too \nembarrassed to tell the public about? \n• The ultimate goal of FSANZ is ‘A safe food supply and well-informed customers’. The people of Australia \nand NZ hold FSANZ to this task. \n \n \n  \n 48\nAttachment 3 \n \nRisk Assessment Report  \n \nDefinition:  Isinglass is a processing aid derived from the swim bladder of tropical and \nsubtropical fish species for use as a fining/clarifying agent. \n \nRisk Assessment \n \n1. General \n \n1.1 Fish allergy - parvalbumin \n \nAllergy to vertebrate fin fish is well documented in the scientific and clinical literature, \nincluding double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies. Fish muscle, \nskin and roe have been reported to cause allergic reactions, the latter only rarely (Sicherer et \nal., 2000; Escudero et al., 2007). Allergic reactions to the consumption of fish/fish products \nmay include life-threatening anaphylaxis. Fish allergy reportedly affects 0.4% of the US adult \npopulation (Sampson, 2004); but there are currently no data on the prevalence of fish allergy \nin the Australian and New Zealand adult population.   \n \nParvalbumins are a class of calcium-binding proteins found at highest concentration in fast \ncontracting/relaxing muscle fibres of vertebrates. In fish, parvalbumins are generally \nassociated with skeletal muscle. Parvalbumins have molecular weights of approximately  \n10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values\n2. Parvalbumins are water soluble and resistant to heat \ntreatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975-[as cited in Chen et al. 2006]).  \n \nParvalbumins are the allergenic fish proteins, and possibly the sole allergens for most \nindividuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin is the allergen in several fish \nspecies including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel and tuna. Parvalbumin sequences from \ncommonly consumed fish species are highly homologous. This would indicate a high \nlikelihood of IgE cross-reactivity to a range of fish species for at least some fish-allergic \nindividuals (Swoboda et al., 2002; Hilger et al., 2004; Van Do, 2005).  \n \nThere is limited information on the potential allergenicity of fish collagen. In a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) study, a mild, subjective reaction was reported \nby one out of 30 fish-allergic patients given 7.6 g codfish skin gelatine (Hansen et al., 2004).  \n \n1.2 Fish swim bladder – anatomical location and tissue composition \n \nThe swim bladder is an air sac located in the dorsal part of the body cavity of most fish \nspecies. As such, it can be readily detached without significant contamination with the fish \nmuscle tissue. The swim bladders from certain tropical and subtropical fish species are used \nto prepare commercial isinglass.  \n \nThe major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denatured product, gelatin. \nIsinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. \nCollagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass.\n                                                \n \n2 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     \n 49\nThere is no evidence to suggest that elastin is allergenic and, as mentioned above, the clinical \nrelevance of collagen/gelatin allergenicity has not been shown.   \n \nCollagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish \nmuscle, skin and swim bladder. The fish swim bladder is the source of collagen, known \ncommercially as isinglass. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by cross \nlinkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular weight of \n800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, which are \nusually small, compact proteins with molecular weight ranging between 10 kDa and 80 kDa. \n \nCollagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to \nform random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass \nproduction because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from \ncoldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC. There is no evidence that gelatin is a clinically \nimportant allergen in fish-allergic individuals. \n \n1.3 The hazard and the risk  \n \nFor fish-allergic consumers, fish parvalbumin is the relevant allergen of significance i.e. the \nhazard. The FSANZ risk assessment process considers that the hazard is the potential\n to \ncause an adverse reaction and the risk is the likelihood of the adverse reaction actually \noccurring within the conditions of exposure. In the context of this Application, the overall \nrisk to fish-allergic consumers is dependent on the level of exposure to parvalbumin through \nthe consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine.   \n \n2. Beer-related data \n \nInformation in this section is mainly extracted from documents provided by the Applicant to \nFSANZ in 2008 (originally submitted by the Brewers of Europe and the Brewing, Food and \nBeverage Industry Suppliers Association to EFSA in 2006).  \n \n2.1 Analytical methods used in beer studies \n \n2.1.1 Isinglass detection   \n \nA method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in fined beers can be \nconcentrated using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to pure isinglass. The separated \nisinglass can then be hydrolysed to its constituent acids and quantified by measuring the \ncontent of hydroxyproline, an imino acid characteristic of animal collagens. The limit of \ndetection (LOD) of this method is 0.17 mg isinglass/L of beer. Information provided by the \nApplicant indicates this method was used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues \nwhich could be present in beer. \n \n2.1.2 Parvalbumin detection   \n \nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fish parvalbumin was used to measure \nparvalbumin levels in swim bladders, isinglass and beer. Using monoclonal antibody directed \nagainst carp parvalbumin, a competitive ELISA was developed and found to be capable of \ndetecting 0.05 µg/ml of carp parvalbumin (or 1 µg/g).  \n  \n 50\nAn improved method was developed based on anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibodies \nwhich would have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider range of fish \nspecies. The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not substantially cross-react with \ncommon food ingredients. The sensitivity of the anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA was shown to \nbe 0.20 µg/g. However, using the sandwich ELISA to measure parvalbumin levels in \nisinglass samples suggests the possibility of matrix inhibition of two to four-fold. Therefore, \nquantitative estimates of parvalbumin levels need to take this into account.    \n \n2.2 Parvalbumin in fish swim bladd er and in isinglass preparations \n \nAlthough parvalbumin is not a major component of the swim bladder, it has been identified in \nthe swim bladder tissue of a western Atlantic fish (Opsanus tau or the oyster toadfish), a \nspecies not used in isinglass production. This information raised the question whether \nparvalbumin may also be present in the swim bladders of some fish species that are used in \nthe commercial production of isinglass. The Applicant provided analytical data on \nparvalbumin levels in eight isinglass samples from three commercial manufacturers. Using \nthe anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA, six samples were below 10 µg/g, one sample at 34 µg/g and \none below 1 µg/g. Various levels of parvalbumin were detected in the swim bladder of seven \nfish species. According to this information, it is possible to minimise the level of parvalbumin \nin isinglass by identifying and eliminating fish species with high levels of parvalbumin.   \n \nParvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions, at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, \nmaking it possible to further minimise residual levels of parvalbumin in isinglass by \nincorporating a washing step in the manufacturing process. The Applicant provided analytical \ndata which indicates that significant reduction of residual parvalbumin in isinglass is \nachieved after washing with a phosphate buffer. The effect of different washing procedures \non parvalbumin levels was tested. The most effective washing process appears to reduce \nparvalbumin level by about four-fold.  \n \nTo ensure minimum parvalbumin content in isinglass, the Applicant indicated that a new \nCode of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the manufacture of isinglass low in \nparvalbumin has been developed and agreed by the industry. The new GMP Code \nincorporates an additional washing step using phosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving \nstep in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed  \n25 mm, and the exclusion of fish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. \nData presented by the Applicant shows that parvalbumin residues in eight samples of \ncommercial isinglass, prepared using the new GMP, are below 1 µg/g.  \n   \n2.3 Residues of isinglass and parvalbumin in fined beer \n \nInformation provided by the Applicant states that residual amounts of isinglass in bottle and \ncan beer are below the LOD and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/L. For keg and cask \nbeer, isinglass residues are at 3-5 mg/L.  \n \nExperiments were conducted using ELISA methods in order to determine whether detectable \nparvalbumin remained in the fined beer. Samples of beer fined with isinglass, containing \nvarious levels of parvalbumin, were freeze-dried and tested. Data provided indicates that no \nparvalbumin could be detected in the beer samples, which included lager and cask ale.  \n  \n 51\nTheoretical calculations suggest that parvalbumin levels would be below the level of \ndetection of the ELISA method used in these tests.   \n \nSince parvalbumin residues in beer are too low to measure, the Applicant provided an \nestimate of potential parvalbumin based on the following information:  \n \n• The dose of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/L. This is around the highest dose which \nwould be used commercially for cask beers and is 2-3 times higher than the dose used \nfor most brewery-conditioned beers.  \n• Residual levels of isinglass in beer, when detectable, range from 1 mg/L for can and \nbottle beer to 5 mg/L for cask beer. Even in cloudy beer, the level is not reported to \nexceed 5 mg/L. \n• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products currently on the market (old \nprotocol) is 10 µg/g (cod equivalent) on a dry weight basis.   \n• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products using the new GMP protocol is \n1 µg/g. \n• Parvalbumin most likely co-sediments with isinglass residue and does not partition into \nthe fluid part of the beer (see section 2.4 below). \n \nBased on this information, parvalbumin levels in beer are calculated to be 0.001 µg/L for \nbottle and can beer, and 0.005 µg/L for cask-conditioned beer using isinglass prepared \naccording to the new protocol. For traditionally prepared isinglass, the levels are estimated to \nbe ten times higher at 0.01 µg/L and 0.05 µg/L for can and cask beer, respectively. These \nestimated levels of parvalbumin are considered, together with oral challenge studies, in the \nexposure assessment.   \n \n2.4 Parvalbumin levels in beer sediments \n \nParvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions at neutral and alkaline pH. Data \nprovided by the Applicant indicates that the level of parvalbumin in isinglass can be \nminimised by washing in buffer solution. For any residual parvalbumin, which is not \neliminated from isinglass, there are two potential scenarios. Parvalbumin residues would \neither end up in the sediment or in the fluid. In the acidic environment of beer brewing, \nparvalbumin would be expected to precipitate with the isinglass to form the sediment. \nAnalytical data provided by the Applicant suggests this to be the case.   \n \nIsinglass commercially prepared using the old protocol (which assumes a typical parvalbumin \ncontent of 10 µg/g as determined by cod parvalbumin ELISA) was added to beer at a dose of \n36 mg/L (0.36 µg parvalbumin/L) of beer. The sediment was collected and tested for \nparvalbumin content using the cod parvalbumin ELISA. The results suggest that parvalbumin \ncontent in isinglass is concentrated in the sediment and therefore, is unlikely to be present in \nthe clear portion of the beer.     \n \n2.5 Clinical testing \n \n2.5.1 Skin prick tests \n \nSkin prick testing (SPT) provides information about the presence of IgE antibody specific to \na given allergen. Although SPT for food allergy is valid, interpretation can be complex and \npositive tests often occur without clinical allergy (ASCIA-SPT Manual 2006).  \n 52\nThe Applicant provided information on skin prick tests performed using extracts from a \nnumber of the fish species that are used in the manufacture of commercial isinglass. Flesh \nand swim bladder extracts were prepared from six fish species, and checked for microbial \ncontamination to eliminate false positive due to non-allergic inflammation. SPT was \nperformed on eight fish-allergic individuals according to a protocol developed at the Food \nAllergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP). Samples of blood were also taken from \nthe individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. All eight patients tested were positive \nwhen skin tested with fish flesh extracts. Seven of eight patients were positive with fish swim \nbladder extracts.  \n \nInformation was also provided by the Applicant on a separate study conducted in France \nwhere six patients with verified fish allergy were challenged with commercial isinglass. Two \nof the six patients were skin-test positive, but all six patients were negative in the oral \nchallenge test (see below). \n \nThese skin prick test results, when considered in conjunction with the oral challenge results \nconducted on the same patients, do not appear to be clinically relevant. This is because \nindividuals may have allergen-specific IgE which leads to positive skin prick tests, but do not \nreact to oral challenge with the same allergen. This is a well-acknowledged and commonly \nencountered response in food allergy testing.   \n \n2.5.2 Oral challenge tests \n \nControlled oral food challenges are the gold standard in diagnosing food allergy. However, \nthe targeted nature of the recruitment and the strict qualifying criteria, including convincing \nclinical history, limits the number of subjects available to participate in such studies.\n   \n \nIn the context of this Application, oral challenges are conducted to determine whether or not \nthe test samples (isinglass used as a fining agent) can provoke an allergic reaction in fish-\nallergic individuals. \n \nA protocol for DBPCFC tests were developed by FARRP using isinglass prepared according \nto the new protocol. Fish-allergic patients were dosed every half an hour with isinglass \nstarting from a low dose and gradually increasing over a period of two hours. The doses used \nwere 0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg of isinglass in mashed potatoes. In this study, 15 fish-allergic \npatients were tested but none reacted to the oral challenge with isinglass, even at the very \nhighest dose used. Based on parvalbumin content of 1 µg/g isinglass, the total of the \nchallenge doses is equivalent to over 50 L of beer (or 10 L of cask beer) exceeding the \nvolume that is possible to consume in a single sitting.  \n \nAnother study was conducted separately in France using isinglass containing 10 µg/g \nparvalbumin.  \nAccording to information provided by the Applicant, this is a typical sample of commercially \navailable isinglass. Six patients with allergy to fish, as determined by oral food challenge or \nby a convincing clinical history at the time of the study, were included. Each patient received \na total of 20 mg of isinglass, mixed with cooked potato, over two hours. None of the patients \nhad positive reactions to the oral challenge (while two of the six patients showed positive \nreactions in the skin prick test using the same material). \n  \n 53\nThese two studies, conducted by experts in the field using rigorous protocols, provide \nsupporting evidence that isinglass does not pose a safety concern for fish-allergic consumers.    \n \n2.6 Exposure assessment \n \nThe data suggest that levels of isinglass that may remain in beer do not exceed 1 mg/L for \nbottle or can beer, and 5 mg/L for cask beer. The level of parvalbumin in isinglass is likely to \nvary according to the manufacturing protocol (from 1 µg/g for the new protocol to 10 µg/g \nfor the old protocol). No data are available on the level of parvalbumin in beer because it is \nbelow the LOD for current methodologies. As parvalbumin is known to be insoluble in the \nacidic environment of fermentation, it is expected to co-sediment with isinglass which is \nremoved during the beverage production and is not consumed. \n \nFSANZ notes that currently there are no agreed thresholds for any food allergen including \nparvalbumin. A threshold is the lowest dose of the allergen (parvalbumin) that can trigger an \nallergic reaction in fish-allergic individuals. However, the levels of parvalbumin that may be \nconsumed in isinglass-fined beer are likely to be very low (estimated to be 0.001-0.005 µg/L \nfor new protocol isinglass and ten fold higher at 0.01-0.05 µg/L for old protocol isinglass). \n \nThe oral challenge studies indicate that isinglass prepared according to either the old or the \nnew protocol did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the 21 fish-allergic individuals. The \nisinglass doses used in these studies and corresponding volumes of beer are as follows: \n \nIsinglass prepared \naccording to: \n \nThe cumulative oral challenge dose \n(no reactions observed): \nEquivalent volume of beer \nNew manufacturing protocol  \n \n50.5 mg isinglass \n(isinglass was given in increasing \ndose of 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 \nmg in about 40 grams in mashed \npotato over 2 hours) \n50 L of bottle/can beer \n10 L of cask beer \n \nOld manufacturing protocol  \n \n20 mg isinglass 20 L of bottle/can beer \n4 L of cask beer \n \nAn average drinker of beer may consume about 1.5 L of beer within a single sitting, while a \nheavy drinker of beer may consume up to 3 L of beer within a single sitting. Clearly the dose \nof isinglass tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral challenge studies, as reported by \nthe Applicant, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of beer that \ncould be consumed by an individual within a single sitting.  \n \nIn light of the normal constrains on the volume that can be consumed by an individual within \na few hours, FSANZ considers that potential exposure to parvalbumin through the \nconsumption of beer fined with isinglass is likely to be extremely low.   \n  \n 54\n2.7 Literature search \n \nTwo literature searches were provided by the Applicant to demonstrate the rarity of reports \non beer allergy. The searches, conducted in 2004 and in 2006, had numerous search words \nand covered 33 databases3. These extensive searches have failed to identify any publications \nthat may be relevant to fish allergy due to consumption of beer. \n \n3. Wine-related data \n \nInformation in this section is derived from documents provided to FSANZ by the Australian \nWine Research Institute (AWRI) in April 2008; and from EFSA opinion (Request N\no EFSA-\nQ-2006-154 – published in the EFSA Journal 2007, 533:1-8).   \n \n3.1 Usage of isinglass in wine \n \nInformation provided to FSANZ by the AWRI indicates that isinglass is used under GMP (as \nrequired in the Code under Standard 1.3.3) as a fining agent mainly in the production of white \nwine.  \n \nThe amount of isinglass used is determined for individual batches to avoid overuse, but \ntypically falls between 10-25 mg isinglass/L of wine. Isinglass is removed by sedimentation \nfollowed by racking, which may include high performance centrifugation or filtration.  \n \n3.2 Residual amounts of isinglass in wine \n \nAnalytical data, commissioned by the AWRI, is provided for two commercial samples of \nisinglass-fined wine produced according to GMP (Hofman et al., 2002). The analytical \nmethod is based on partial purification of collagen from the test sample followed by analysis \nusing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) technique. \nThe wine samples had been fined with 0.42 and 4.4 mg isinglass/L wine, respectively. No \ncollagen bands were detected in the wine samples. Using the same method, collagen residues \ncould be recovered and detected in beer samples spiked with collagen at concentration of   \n1.0 mg/L or more. The AWRI concludes that the concentration of residual isinglass in the \ncommercial wine samples is likely to be less than 1 mg/L. This is the same level of residual \nisinglass that has been reported for bottled beer. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-\nallergic consumers, was not detectable in beer samples fined using isinglass prepared \naccording to the old or the new protocol. Although no data on parvalbumin detection was \navailable for wine, there is no reason to expect the findings would be different from beer. \nTherefore, theoretical levels of parvalbumin, estimated to be 0.001-0.05 µg/L can be \nextrapolated.  \n \nIn a recently published study, 16 wines were tested for residues of isinglass (Weber et al \n2007). The wines were fined with four commercially available isinglass preparations at 50 or \n250 mL isinglass/100 L wine. \n                                                \n \n3 Search words: beer, ale(s), lager, brewery, allergen(s), allergic, allergenicity, allergies, allergenic, \nhypersensitivity, sensitive, anaphylaxis, parvalbumin, isinglass. \nDatabases searched included: Analytical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, medline, Registry of toxic Effects, \nToxline, Food Science & Technology Abstracts, Conference Papers index, Dissertation Abstracts, etc… \n  \n 55\nNo residual isinglass could be detected in any of the wines when a competitive ELISA with \nLOD ≤ 5 µg/L was used. These findings further support results of undetectable isinglass in \ntwo samples of isinglass-fined Australian wines.  \n \n3.3 Potential allergenicity of isinglass-fined wine \n \nAn investigation of potential food allergens in fined wine was reported, including full details \nof the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and basophil activation analysis (Rolland \net al., 2006). The scope of the study included wine fined with isinglass as well as egg and \nmilk-derived processing aids. The data relevant to isinglass is outlined below. \n \n3.3.1 Literature search \n \nA search of the medical literature was conducted by the AWRI on PubMed using the terms ‘wine \nAND allergy’. The most commonly-reported adverse reactions among alcoholic beverage \nconsumers appear to be associated with sulphite additives. However, the search was unable to \nidentify any documented cases of adverse reactions specifically associated with isinglass.  \n \n3.3.2 Double-blind placebo-controlled trial -Exposure to isinglass in fined wine \n \nThe clinical study included ten fish-allergic subjects recruited from the Allergy Clinics, \nAlfred Hospital in Melbourne. The patients (five females and five males) were diagnosed by \na clinical allergist with IgE-mediated food allergy, based on a history of anaphylaxis and \ncorresponding demonstration of specific IgE to allergens of fish or by skin prick testing. The \nexception was one individual who had negative tests for IgE but a positive oral fish \nchallenge. Clinical characteristics of the ten fish-allergic individuals are included in the \npublished study (Rolland et al., 2006). \n \nControl subjects, with no IgE to any of the allergens including fish, were also included in the \nstudy.  \n \nAll subjects avoided antihistamine medications for three days, short-acting bronchodilator \ntherapy for four hours, and long-acting bronchodilator therapy for twelve hours before each \nvisit. Alcohol ingestion was avoided for at least three days before challenge, with subjects \nfasted for at least eight hours. \n \nSamples from 23 isinglass-fined wines were used in the study. Controls wines were clarified \nusing other non-food protein-processing aids and/or filtration.  \n \nEach subject consumed 100 mL (approximately one standard drink) over 10-15 minutes and \ncompleted a symptom questionnaire by using a visual analogue scale and repeated it at  \n15 minute intervals for two hours after challenge. Over the next six days, subjects abstained \nfrom alcoholic beverages and recorded any possible late reactions in a diary.  \n \nThe study reported that one fish-allergic subject developed mild lip numbness, which \nresolved spontaneously, after ingestion of a control unfined wine. No subjects developed a \ntypical IgE-mediated allergic reaction requiring medical treatment and no diary card \nabnormalities were noted during follow-up.  \n  \n 56\n3.3.3 Basophil activation analysis \n \nAn analysis using a modified basophil activation assay was described in the study by Rolland et \nal. (2006). The study reported that one isinglass-fined wine caused weak basophil activation for \ntwo out of ten fish-allergic subjects, but this same wine was also reported to have caused weak \nactivation of basophils from a peanut-allergic subject (who is not allergic to fish). The two fish-\nallergic subjects showed no clinical adverse reactions to another wine made using isinglass. \nOne of the two fish-allergic subjects showed weak basophil activation to a wine made using \nnon-grape tannin but this subject was not allergic to peanuts or tree nuts.   \n \n4 Conclusion \n \nThe Table to clause 6 in the Standard 1.3.3 (Processing Aids) requires that isinglass is used \naccording to GMP. Adherence to GMP in the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent minimises \nthe potential level of residual isinglass in the final product. Information provided by the \nApplicant indicates that residual level of isinglass in bottled beer and wine is about 1 mg/L   \n \nLow but variable levels of parvalbumin may be present in commercial isinglass. Reducing the \nlevel of parvalbumin in isinglass even further is technically achievable by incorporating \nsteps, including further washing, into the GMP for isinglass manufacturing. The Applicant \nstates that the revised GMP is now widely adopted by the isinglass manufacturers which \nsupply the Australian and New Zealand markets. Using currently available detection \nmethods, parvalbumin was not detectable in isinglass-fined beer regardless of whether the \nisinglass was prepared according to the old or new protocol. \n \nTogether, the GMP for the production of isinglass and the GMP for the use of isinglass in the \nfining of beer and wine, provide a high level of safety that counteracts uncertainties identified \nin this paper. The uncertainties relate to the newly developed analytical methodologies used \nin generating the data provided by the Applicant, the lack of information on the prevalence of \nfish allergy among the adult population in Australia and New Zealand, and the lack of an \nagreed threshold for parvalbumin.  \n \nTherefore, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely \nto present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.  \n \nReferences \n \nAas, K. and Elsayed, S.

The rod-like helical structure and amphoteric nature (able to be both an \nacid and base) of the isinglass collagen are responsible for isinglass’s clarification properties. \nThe yeast cells, polyphenolic and protein substances form complexes with the isinglass and \nsettle to the bottom of the fermentation vessels, thereby assisting in clarifying the liquid.    \n \nResidual isinglass in packaged beer and wine has been shown to be removed by the filtration \nprocess, whereas cask conditioned beer (which is unfiltered) would require sufficient \nsedimentation time to ensure all the isinglass has time to settle and form a stable mass at the \nbottom of the cask. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) needs to be followed when isinglass \nis utilised as a clarifying agent to ensure the minimum possible residue of isinglass in the \nfinished product. \n \nThe isinglass may potentially contain the protein parvalbumin, a known fish allergen. The \nlevel of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be minimised by establishing and adopting a \nmanufacturing Code of Practice which is intended to reduce the level of parvalbumin.  \n \n1. Introduction \n \nIsinglass is used extensively as a processing aid in the brewing and wine industry to improve \nthe efficiency of the fining process (also called clarification) of beer and wine. Isinglass has \nbeen used for several centuries for this purpose. An estimated 200 tonnes of isinglass is used \nannually to clarify an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide. \n \n2. Production process of isinglass \n \nIsinglass is a collagen derived from dried swim bladders of specific tropical and subtropical \nfish. The traditional basic production process may vary between manufacturers, which can \nalso depend on the source and species of the fish and does not seem to have a high level of \nstandardisation (EFSA, 2007). The main steps involve blending swim bladders of specified \nfish to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply; granulation to reduce the size; washing in \nchilled water, sterilizing in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution and final rinsing with water. \nThe sterilised granulated swim bladder is then further processed to different product forms \nsuch as powder, paste, ready-to-use paste and dry parchment or matted form. The three main \nforms of commercial isinglass are summarised below.  \n \n2.1 Isinglass powder \n \nThe sterilised hydrated isinglass is extruded using narrow apertures, which disrupts the \ncollagen fibres.  It is then dried and milled into a powder of less than 1000 microns.   \n  \n 59\n2.2 Isinglass paste  \n \nThe sterilised hydrated isinglass is macerated to less than 1000 microns paste by high shear \nmixing with the addition of sodium or potassium metabisulphite (as preservative). The paste \nis standardised to about 10% solids. \n \n2.3 Ready-to-use paste \n \nThe isinglass paste can be further diluted then acidified with food grade acids to a pH of 2.0-3.0. \nThe solids level is typically 0.3-1.5%. Sulphur dioxide is often used as a preservative. \n \n2.4 The new manufacturing protoc ol for isinglass production  \n \nAn industry-agreed GMP for isinglass has been adopted by the major suppliers of isinglass to \nensure the presence of parvalbumin can be minimised. This GMP includes an additional \nwashing stage using a phosphate buffer and successive washing steps with fresh water, the \nintroduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall size \ndoes not exceed 25 mm and the exclusion of certain fish species. Some fish species appear to \nhave low levels of parvalbumin and therefore, have been specifically included in the new \nGMP (EFSA, 2007). \n \n3. Physico-chemical characteristics and technological function of isinglass \n \n3.1 Functions and characteristics \n \nA fining agent such as isinglass is added to beer and wine to reduce or remove the presence \nof one or more undesirable components in order to achieve clarity and potentially improve \nsensory appeal, flavour and physical stability in the final product (Morris and Main, 1995). \n \nThe major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen (95%) along with small amounts of \ngelatine, its denaturation product (Hickman et al., 2000; EFSA, 2007). The isinglass collagen \nexists as a rod-like triple helical molecule, amphoteric in nature (able to be both an acid and \nbase) and is thermally labile, denaturing at about 29\noC to form the random coils of gelatine \n(Hickman et al., 2000). However, the fish allergen, parvalbumins, present mainly in fish \nmuscles and at low levels in fish bladders, seems to be heat stable after heating for three \nhours at 90oC (Arif et al., 2007). The parvalbumin has a pI (isoelectric point) of around  \n3.9-5.5 (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000). \n \nIsinglass collagen has a molecular weigh of 800-1300 kDa and contains hydroxyproline in its \nstructure, which is important to its functionality (EFSA, 2007). The rod-like structural \nintegrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for efficient clarification \n(Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the fining activity is based \nupon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically attract yeast cells with \nnegatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged polyphenolic and protein \ncomponents. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the bottom of the container. In \nthe sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in firm sediment that is resistant to \ndisturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  \n  \n 60\n3.2 Clarifying process procedure in the brewing industry \n \nIn the brewing process, after fermentation, the beer is cooled to around freezing, which \nencourages settling of the yeast and causes proteins to coagulate and settle out with the yeast. \nSimilar to the wine production process, it is at this stage that isinglass powder dissolved in \ndilute solutions of food grade acids is added to the fermented beer to aid in the clarifying \nprocess. The pH of beer is typically between 3.9 and 4.6 (Siebert and Lynn, 2005). At this \npH, isinglass is positively charged (iso-electric point of isinglass is around 5.5) and thus \nattracting and aggregating negatively charged particles. However, if the pH of the beer is \nbelow 3.5, the fining activity is severely inhibited (Ward, 2008).    \n \nFor optimum fining performance, beer must be fined at the coldest point in the process. The \nreason is that if the chill haze (from protein precipitation) is present prior to isinglass \naddition, it is then readily removed by fining. This is especially important for cask beer, since \nthere are no effective alternatives to the use of isinglass in producing bright unfiltered beer \n(Ward 2008).   \n \nInformation provided by the Applicant suggests that the brewing industry typically uses \nisinglass at a low level of between 10-15 mg/L but this level can potentially go as high as    \n60 mg/L in some brews. The sediment formed by the collagen and yeast complex is removed \nby filtration and/or the centrifugation processes, resulting in very low residual levels of \nisinglass in the final product. Cask conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or \ncentrifugation and relies on gravity settling.  \n \n3.3 Clarification function of isingl ass in wine production process  \n \nThe flowchart in Figure 1 below shows generalised processing steps of white wine. The red \nwine process is expected to be similar. The fining step, where isinglass is usually added, \noccurs after alcohol fermentation has been completed and before filtration. The main purpose \nis to aggregate polymeric carbohydrates, proteins and polyphenols to form larger aggregates \nthat sink to the bottom. Such aggregation improves the filtering efficiency as a consequence \nby initially clarifying the wine (Wucherpfenning, 2003).  \n \nThree different types of filters are commonly used in wine filtration; precoat filter, sheet filter \nand membrane filter, which are membranes of different pore size that can be used to remove \nparticles down to the molecular level from the wine.   \n \nAfter the fining and filtration process, the wine is normally sufficiently clear and has a pH \nvalue ranged from 2.8-4.0, depending on the types of wine (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). \nSome wines are subjected to further cold stabilisation before they are ready for development \nto maturity and bottled. \n \nIsinglass is claimed to be a preferred clarification agent compared to egg or casein, because \nof its mild effect on flavour. Different batches of wine require different amounts of isinglass, \nas determined by laboratory tests. In Australia, isinglass is typically added at between \napproximately 20-50 mg/L in the production of wine (Wine Australia, 2008), in New \nZealand, use in wine is typically about 6-10 mg/L (New Zealand Winegrowers, 2008) and use \nin white wine in France is typically between 10-25 mg/L (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). In \nboth Australia and New Zealand isinglass is considered as the best and most expensive \nclarifying agent and is not likely to be used in excess if usage is not warranted.  \n 61\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1:  Flow chart of white winemaking stages with the clarification steps indicated in the \ndotted box (Amended from diagram provided by Winemakers' Federation of Australia, 2005). \n \n3.3 Good Manufacturing practice for usage of Isinglass  \n  \nGood Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a requirement in regulating the maximum amount of \nthe isinglass which may be present in a food. The relevant GMP criteria for isinglass are: \n \n(a) the quantity added to food shall be limited to the lowest possible level necessary to \naccomplish its desired effect;  \n \n(b) the quantity that becomes a component of f ood as a result of its use in the manufacture, \nprocessing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any \nphysical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent \nreasonably possible; and \n \n(c) the material is prepar ed and handled in the same way as a food ingredient. \n \n4. Allergenic residue issues \n \n4.1 Parvalbumin as the allergen \n \nParvalbumin has been identified as a fish allergen, based mainly on studies of three species of \nfish: Atlantic salmon, carp and Japanese horse mackerel.  \nIsinglass  \nsolution \npressings\nfree-run juice\ncombined or \nkept \nChilled, settled, racked \n white gr apes\n↓\nfermented \nwine racked off yeast deposit \ncold stabilised and fined\nracked and filtered\nstored\nsterile filtered\nbottled\n↓\n↓\n↓\n↓\n↓\n↓\n↓\n↓\nwhite grapes \ncrushed \ndrained \nskins and stems \npressed \nmarc \ndisposal or distillation \nafter \nfermentation \nlees \n↓ \n↓ \n↓ \n↓ \n↓ \n↓ \n↓ \n↓\nClarification process  \n 62\nFurther immuno-blotting analyses led to the conclusion that parvalbumin is the major fish \nalbumin independent of fish species (Hamada et al., 2001). Parvalbumin is generally \nassociated with skeletal muscle tissue, even though the presence of parvalbumin has \npreviously been detected in swim bladders of fish not used for isinglass manufacture (Feher \net al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).   \n \n4.2 Reported studies on residues of isinglass in beer and wine \n \nIt was reported that the filtration process removed all isinglass residues in filtered beer during \nthe process, tested using a HPLC method that can detect amino acids concentration as low as \n3.9 x 10-13 mg/L. However, the study showed that in order for the cask beer to be free of \nisinglass, sufficient time is required for the sediment to settle properly before dispensing \n(Chlup et al., 2006). \n \nA recent study investigated the manufacturing processes on the removal of a range of fining \nagents in four German wines. The wines were dosed with isinglass at 10-50 mg/L and other \nfining agents at five times their normal dosage levels. ELISA assays were used as the \nanalytical method and detected no isinglass or fish gelatine in wine, except lysozyme and \ndried egg white, which are soluble in wine. It demonstrated that fining agents used for wine \nare removed during the manufacturing process or those that are insoluble are removed by \nfiltration (Weber et al., 2007).   \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nIsinglass derived from fish swim bladders used as a clarifying agent in the brewing and wine \nindustry may contain parvalbumin. The level of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be \nminimised by following a GMP that is specifically designed for this purpose. \n \nResidual isinglass has been shown to be removed by the filtration/settling process in wine, in \nbeer that is filtered; and in cask conditioned beer (that is unfiltered) if sufficient \nsedimentation time is received. It is very likely that parvalbumin with its pI at around 3.9-5.5, \ncould precipitate out in wine and beer, which also has pH around 4 and lower. The \nprecipitated parvalbumin would then settle with the sediment with isinglass-protein \ncomplexes or be filtered out by the filtration processes. \n \nReferences \n \nArif, S.H., Jabeen, M. and Hasnain, A.U.

Those appli-\ncations concern substances for which provisional\nexemptions were granted by Directive 2005/26/EC. On\nthe basis of the EFSA opinions and other available infor-\nmation, it can be concluded that certain ingredients or\nsubstances derived from those ingredients listed in Annex\nIIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC are not likely, under specific\ncircumstances, to cause adverse reactions in susceptible\nindividuals.\n(5) Those ingredients or substances derived from those\ningredients should therefore be permanently excluded\nfrom Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(6) Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended\naccordingly.\n(7) Directive 2005/26/EC should be repealed on\n26 November 2007 in view of the deadline set by\nArticle 6(11), second subparagraph of Directive\n2000/13/EC.\n(8) In order to avoid disruption of the market, it is necessary\nfor this Directive to apply from the 26 November 2007.\n(9) It was expected that this Directive could be adopted and\npublished well in advance of the date of 26 November\n2007 in order to give time to the industry to adapt to\nthe new rules. Since this has not been possible in\npractice, temporary measures appear therefore necessary\nto facilitate the application of the new rules.

Fining  is achieved by mixing fining \nagents with the beer duri ng production, thereafter comple xed materials are removed by \nsedimentation, filtration, or both. Commonly used fining agents include a collagen preparation \nfrom fish swim bladders, isinglass. Fish alle rgy has been reported to affect 0.2%-2.2% of the \npopulation in European countries. Fi sh can cause severe reactions in allergic individuals and it \nis appropriate to assess allergen levels in beer clarified with isinglass. \n                                                                                                                                                                              \nAllergens of concern in isinglass are primaril y residual amounts of the major fish allergen \nparvalbumin, and collagen/gelatine which constitu te the major component (95%) of isinglass. \nAn industry-agreed Code of Good Manufactur ing Practice (GMP) for isinglass has been \nadopted by the applicant to lower the content of parvalbumin in the product. This substantially \nreduced the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass. A history of safe use is claimed. However, there \nmay have been a significant under-reporting of react ions against isinglass in beer, because it is \nuncertain whether beer drinkers and health pr ofessionals have been aware of the possible \npresence of fish protein in beer. Analytical data indicate a re sidue level of isinglass in beer up \nto 5 mg/L. Parvalbumin levels in isinglass ranged from 0.2 mg/Kg to 0.7 mg/Kg. The estimated \nmaximum concentration of parvalbumin in beer is 0.005 μg/L. However, there is considerable \nuncertainty about the accuracy of the assa ys. Two new double-blind placebo-controlled food \nchallenge studies with isingla ss are reported, in which none of  21 fish allergic patients \nexperienced any adverse effects.  \n \nOn the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass \nused as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals \nunder the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant. \n \n  \nKEY WORDS \n \nBeer, fining, isinglass, fish, allergy.  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 2 of 10 \nBACKGROUND  \n \nIn November 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted  Directive 2003/89/EC 1 \namending Directive 2000/13/EC, as regards indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. \n  \nAnnex IIIa of the Directive specif ies a list of food ingredients or substances that are known to \ntrigger allergic reactions or intolerances in sensitive individuals for which no labelling \nexemptions are allowed. Whenever the listed ingr edients/substances or their derivatives are \nused in the production of foodstuffs, they must be labelled. \n \nArticle 1, paragraph 11, subparagraph 2 of the Di rective establishes a procedure allowing for \ntemporary labelling exemption of derivatives fr om ingredients listed in Annex IIIa for which it \nhas been scientifically established that it is not  possible for them to cause adverse reactions. In \naccordance with this provision, submissions of re quest for temporary labelling exemption were \nnotified to the Commission before 25 August 2004. The Commission, after consultation with \nthe European Food Safety Authorit y, adopted a list (Directive 2005/26/EC\n2) of those \ningredients which are temporarily excluded fr om Annex IIIa until 25 November 2007, pending \nthe final results of the notified studies.  \n \nConsequently, applicants who submitted a dossier in 2004 on the basis of subparagraph 2, \nresulting in the inclusion of a product in the list of Direc tive 2005/26/EC, and who are seeking \nexclusion of that product from Annex IIIa beyond 25 November 2007, will have to submit a \nrequest enclosing the final results of the notified scientific studies. Therefore in the context of \nthe permanent labelling exemption procedure, th e European Food Safety Authority is asked to \nprovide scientific opinions on the submissi ons in accordance with the present terms of \nreference. \n \n \nTERMS OF REFERENCE \n \nIn accordance with Article 29 (1) (a) of Regulation (EC) N° 178/2002, the European \nCommission requests the European  Food Safety Authority to evaluate the scientific data \nsubmitted by the Brewers of Europe and BFBi (Brewing Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers \nAssociation) in the framework of the procedur e laid down for temporary labelling exemptions \nin Article 6, paragraph 11 of Di rective 2000/13/EC. On the basis of that evaluation, EFSA is \nrequested to issue an opinion on the informati on provided, and particul arly to consider the \nlikelihood of adverse reactions triggered in susc eptible individuals by th e consumption of the \nfollowing ingredients/substances used under the conditions specified by the applicant: isinglass. \n \n \nASSESSMENT  \n \nThe magnitude of the adult fish-allergic popul ation is uncertain. A Danish population-based \nstudy with double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) verification of allergy \n                                                           \n1 Directive 2003/89/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2000/13/EC as regards \nindication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. OJ L 308. 25.11.2003, p. 15. \n2 Commission Directive 2005/26/EC of 21 March 2005 establishing a list of food ingredients or substances \nprovisionally excluded from Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. \nOJ L 75, 22.03.2005, p. 33-34.  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 3 of 10 \n(Osterballe et al., 2005), found 0.2% of the adult population to  be allergic to codfish. The total \nnumber of fish-allergic individuals may be somewhat higher, because some fish-allergic \nindividuals do not react to codfish. A population-based Amer ican study (telephone survey) \n(Sicherer et al., 2004) gave numbers in the same range , whereas in a European questionnaire-\nbased study (Woods et al., 2001) 2.2% reported (self-perceived) fish allergy or intolerance. \n \nTaking into account the numerous and well documented reports of allergic individuals reacting \nto fish (NDA, 2004a), it is appropriate for the Panel to assess th e likelihood of adverse \nreactions in allerg ic individuals consuming products wher e the fish-derived product isinglass \nhas been used during the manufacturing process. \n \nA dossier submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BFBi) \nand The Brewers of Europe to the European Commission pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 11 of \nDirective 2000/13/EC as amended by Dire ctive 2000/89/EC on 13 May 2004 for temporary \nexemption from labelling was the basis for an earlier assessment of isinglass by the NDA panel \n(NDA, 2004b).  \n \nThe present opinion is based on an updated dossi er from the same organization, with an \napplication for permanent exemption from labe lling. The updated dossier  contains additional \ninformation and data mainly with regard to  improvement of the manufacturing process, \nanalytical studies on isinglass in beer and on the amount of parvalbumin in isinglass, and \nclinical studies of allergenicity. \n \n1. Manufacturing process  \n \nIsinglass is a form of collagen derived from  dried swim bladders of  certain tropical and \nsubtropical fish. The production process vari es, according to the applicant, between \nmanufacturers. It consists of blending of swim bladders from di fferent fish to meet quality, \nfunctionality, cost and supply criteria. Then various step s follow including granulation, \nwashing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen peroxide and further washing.  \n \nIsinglass powder, paste and “ready-to-use” liqui ds are tested empirically for functionality \n(clarification efficiency) by the isinglass indust ry to ensure consiste nt performance of the \nproduct. The customers purchase according to certain specifications, including hygienic \n(bacteria, heavy metals) and functionality (pro tein) parameters. The Panel notes that the \ntraditional manufacturing process does not have a high level of standardization, which may \naffect possible residual levels of the majo r fish allergen, parvalbumin. However, in \nconsideration of results from an alytical studies (see below), an  industry-agreed Code of Good \nManufacturing Practice (G MP) for isinglass has been adop ted by the applicants. To reduce \nparvalbumin content in isinglass, this GMP C ode includes an additiona l washing stage using \nphosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim \nbladder wall particle size does not exceed 25 mm , and the exclusion of some previously used \nfish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. \n \n2. Characterisation of the product and its use  \n \n2.1 Characterisation of isinglass  \n \nIt is stated that the major component of isingl ass (95%) is Type I colla gen together with its \ndenaturation product, gelatine (Hickman et al ., 2000; Leach and Barrett, 1967; Moir et al. ,  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 4 of 10 \n1984). Isinglass collagen has a molecular wei ght of 800-1300 kDa. Key to the structure, \nfunctionality and quantification of  isinglass collagen is the presence of hydroxyproline, which \nis rare in other proteins but characteristic of collagen (regar ding its use for quantification of \nisinglass, see below). The profile  of amino acids varies dependi ng on the fish species, and the \nproportion of hydroxyproline reportedly depends on activity and environm ental temperature. \nIsinglass also contains elastin at levels up to 2.5% dry weight . Like collagen, elastin contains \nhydroxyproline.  \n \n2.2 Conditions of use  \n \nIsinglass is used to remove particles from beer . Isinglass is added to beer in soluble form, \ntypically after fermentation an d cooling of the beer, at 15  mg/L (range 10-60 mg/L) for \nbrewery-conditioned beers and around 50 mg/L for cask-conditioned beers. Isinglass is \nthereafter removed by sedimentation fo llowed by filtration (sometimes high-speed \ncentrifugation can replace filtration). Isinglass redu ces the particle load that goes to the filters, \nand also removes some small particles that would pass through the filters.  \n \nCask-conditioned beer is a traditio nal style of beer in England, in which the yeast remains in \nthe cask. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer  before filling or directly into the cask. The \naction of isinglass, it is state d, takes place within the first 3 to 4 hours and results in compact \nsediment at the base of the cask. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the sediment, \nand must be essentially free of suspended part icles. Cask-conditioned beer accounted for 7.5% \nof beer produced in the UK in 2002.  \n \n2.3 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer, and exposure levels \n \n2.3.1 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer \n \nData submitted for temporary exemption (NDA 2004b)  indicated that leve ls of isinglass in \ntypical commercial beers ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/L, based on a pr otein precipitation and \nseparation method. Another method was based on the separation by affinity chromatography \nusing rabbit anti-isinglass antibodies, followed by quantification of isin glass by measuring the \namount of hydroxyproline using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The method \nemploying hydroxyproline as a marker for collagen has been further developed, and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) is reported to correspond to 0.17 mg/L on an isinglass dry weight basis. \n \nResults indicate that for many bottle and can beers, residual levels of isinglass are below the \nLOD. The highest concentrations of isinglass detected in these types of beer did not exceed 1 \nmg/L. For large containers (kegs and casks), isi nglass concentrations were higher. Residues in \nkegs were generally below 1 mg/L, but occasio nal samples contained up to 3 mg/L. For cask-\nconditioned beers, the highest concentrations of isinglass measured did not exceed 5 mg/L. \nEven in cloudy beer, i.e. beer  drawn from just above the se dimented material, in which \nisinglass concentrations were slightly higher th an in the bulk, isinglass concentrations did not \nexceed 5 mg/L. Thus, there was little evidence of a concentration gradient of residues within \nthe beer in either casks or kegs. \n \n2.3.2 Exposure levels \n  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 5 of 10 \nAccording to the applicant, annually an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide are \ntreated with isinglass, approximately 30 milli on hectolitres of that being in Europe. An \nestimated 200 tonnes of isinglass are used annually worldwide to clarify beer. \n \nWith 5 mg/L isinglass and a serving of 350 mL clarified beer, the isinglass intake per serving of \nclarified beer would be 1.75 mg. A consumer drinking 1 litre of beer would have an intake of 5 \nmg. The Panel notes that  the new analytical methodology has led to the ten-fold increased \nexposure estimate for isinglass over that in the previous application (NDA, 2004b).  \n \nParvalbumin exposure must be calculated from isinglass residue data, because the applicant \nwas unable to measure parvalbumin directly in beer (see below). According to the applicant’s \ncalculations, the maximum concentration of pa rvalbumin in beer could range from 0.001 μg/L \n(bottle and can beer) to 0.005 μg/L (cask conditioned beer) ba sed on measurement data with \nthe new GMP isinglass. With the use of traditio nal commercial isinglass the estimate would be \nabout ten-fold higher. Taking measurement un certainties into account and making certain \nassumptions, e.g. that parvalbumin is not eluted from the isinglass into  the beer, the highest \nparvalbumin concentration (new GMP code) derived for cask beer is 0.02 µg/L according to the \napplicant’s estimates. These doses are lower than doses reported to trigger adverse reactions in \ndouble blind placebo controlled food challenge studies (Taylor et al., 2002), assuming that the \nparvalbumin content of fish muscle is 4000 µg/g or less (Vornanen et al., 1999). However, the \nPanel notes the uncertainties about the accuracy of the measurements and assumptions \nregarding the parvalbumin concentration in beer, as well as the uncertainty with regard to the \nlowest dose of parvalbumin that can trigger an allergic reaction.  \n \n3. Evidence of non-allergenicity \n \n3.1 History of non-allergenicity of the product  \n \n3.1.1 Literature search strategy  \n \nThe literature search strategy used to provide historical evidence fo r safety of isinglass used in \nthe process of brewing is well de scribed in the application, both in terms of databases searched \nand search terms used.  \n \n3.1.2 Historical evidence of safe use  \n \nThe applicant states that isinglass has been used  as a fining agent for at least two centuries. \nTraditionally, all beer in the UK was fined with isinglass. Addi tionally, isinglass has \nhistorically been used as an ingredient in f oods and as a setting agent for jellies. Finally, the \nswim bladders themselves are consumed as a food delicacy. In the lit erature search, three \npapers were identified that me ntioned isinglass or fish maws. However, no report s of allergic \nresponses to beer, isinglass or fish maws in fish sensitive individuals were found. \n \nThe Panel notes that it is uncer tain whether allergy to fish ha s been considered by patients \nexperiencing, or by doctors inve stigating, reactions to beer. Mo st people, including medical \npersonnel, are likely to be unaware that subs tances derived from fish are used during \nproduction of beer. Thus, there may have been under-reporting of reactions caused by isinglass \nin beer. \n  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 6 of 10 \nThe Panel further notes that according to the scien tific literature, adverse reactions in part with \nallergy-like symptoms, do not appear to be infrequent following alcoholic beverage \nconsumption. In some surveys of asthmatics,  over 40% have reported the triggering of \nsymptoms and 30-35% reported worsening of their asthma. Although wine was the most \nfrequently reported trigger of these adverse reactions (Vally and Thompson, 2003), reactions to \nbeer also occur often without etiological investigations being undertaken.  \n \n3.2 Preclinical studies on allergenicity  \n \nAllergic reactions to isinglass as fining agent in  beer could be due to residual amounts of the \nmajor fish allergen parvalbumin, or the collagen and gelatine th at are major constituents of \nisinglass. \n \n3.2.1 Residual amounts of parvalbumin  \n \nThe major fish allergen is parvalbumin (NDA , 2004a). The swim bladders of the primitive \nspecies of fish used for isingl ass production have certain anatomical differences from the swim \nbladders of other fish, and are not generally asso ciated with skeletal muscle tissue. However, \nthere is a smooth muscle layer in the swim bl adder wall, and the presence of parvalbumin has \npreviously been demonstrated in swim bladders  of fish not used fo r isinglass manufacture \n(Feher et al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).  \n \nSDS-PAGE analysis of fish used for isingl ass production showed a band at 12 kDa which is \ncharacteristic of parvalbumin, whereas a si milar band was not displayed by swim bladder \nextracts. With immunoblotting (polyclonal ra bbit anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum) however, \ntraces of parvalbumin were detected in one out of six swim bladder samples.  \n \nHomology studies of 18 fish parvalbumins fro m 10 species, based on publicly available \nsequences are reported (NCBI, 200 7). A given fish species cont ains usually 2-5 different \nparvalbumins. Fish species used for isinglass production were not included in the homology \nstudies. Two Atlantic and one Baltic cod pa rvalbumins were 63% to 74% identical, and \nparvalbumins from the other fish were from 53% to 92% identical to the three codfish \nparvalbumins. Referring to the literature (Aalberse, 2000), the applicants conclude that high \nlevels of sequence identity were observed th at indicate a high likelihood of antibody cross-\nreactivity.  \n \nELISA tests based on carp and cod parvalbumins were developed. The anti-carp parvalbumin \nmonoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA was capable of detecting 0.05 µg/mL carp \nparvalbumin in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extract (1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis), \nusing the amount of recombinant carp parvalbu min needed to obtain 20% inhibition as the \ndetection limit. Strong matrix effects were obs erved when 10% fish gelatine extract was used \ninstead of PBS. Comparing different fish speci es, the protein concentration needed to obtain \n50% inhibition was 1.8 µg/mL for carp, 0.4 µg/mL for catfish, 2.8 µg/mL for cod and 10 \nµg/mL for tuna, equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin. Fish used for isinglass \nproduction was not available for testing. The Pane l notes the lack of accuracy of the carp \nparvalbumin-based ELISA, possibly due to species differences, matrix effects or a combination \nthereof. \n \n \nThe anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibody-ba sed sandwich ELISA is reported to have a \nlimit of detection of 0.20 µg/g cod parvalbumin in PBS. Muscle extracts from the fish species  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 7 of 10 \nused for isinglass production did not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, \nalthough there was evidence for the presence of parvalbumin based on SDS-PAGE and \nimmunoblotting with an antibody used in the ELIS A. However, eleven isinglass preparations \ntested gave positive results (see below). The Panel notes that there are uncertainties with regard \nto the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of \nparvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass. \n \nParvalbumin was detected in single-species isingl ass preparations from a range of fish species, \nobtained from six different supplie rs. Certain fish species appear ed to have more parvalbumin \nthan others. Accordingly it was decided that t hose species with high levels of parvalbumin \nwhich were not otherwise essential in commer cial blends for func tional reasons would no \nlonger be used, and a common list of 6 fish speci es was agreed by isinglass manufacturers and \nincorporated into a new GMP code. Further st udies suggested that washing with phosphate \nbuffer could reduce residual parvalbumin in isingl ass approximately 4-fold over levels in the \noriginal raw material, and such washing was also  incorporated into the new GMP code. Levels \nof residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglas s blends on the market (8 products from 3 \nmanufacturers) were found to be in the range of 1-35 mg/Kg, but  mostly less than 10 mg/Kg. \nExperience with the new GMP code is limited, but isinglass parvalbumin levels are expected by \nthe applicant to be less than 1 mg/Kg, and valu es in 9 samples for which data are provided \nranged from undetectable to 0.7 mg/Kg, most being less than 0.3 mg/Kg (codfish ELISA).  \n \nStudies of beer from a 212.700 L tank, as well as theoretical considerations on parvalbumin \nsolubility, suggested that parv albumin was significantly concentr ated in the beer sediment, \nrather than partitioning into the bulk of th e beer. In studies on freeze-dried beers employing \nboth ELISA assays, with a detection limit of about 9 µg parvalbumin/L of beer, no parvalbumin \nwas detected.  \n \n3.2.2 Pepsin digestion \n \nThe applicant reports pepsin digestion experime nts on isinglass. The Pa nel notes that this \nmethod is unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass. \n \n3.2.3 Allergenicity of collagen and gelatine from fish – IgE binding studies \n \n \nGelatine is denatured collagen. A number of scientific papers re port that serum IgE from some \nfish allergic individuals binds to fish collagen and gelatine. However, the presence of IgE-\nbinding to gelatine and collagen does not mean that clinical reactivity is present (see below).   \n \n3.3 Clinical studies on allergenicity \n \n3.3.1 Skin testing  \n  \nProtocols were developed for skin testing with ex tracts of fish muscle and swim bladders from \na range of species of fish used for commercial isinglass manufacture. Of eight Danish fish \nallergic patients tested, 8/8 reacted to the fish muscle, and 7/8 reacted to the swim bladder. This \nindicates that fish allergic individuals in Wester n Europe have the potential to react to the fish \nspecies and the starting material from which isi nglass is produced. No skin prick testing with \ncommercial isinglass is reported. \n \n3.3.2 Double blind placebo cont rolled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies with isinglass   \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 8 of 10 \n \nAccording to the applicant, the isinglass us ed for DBPCFC was prepared from a typical \ncommercial blend of the agreed six fish species using the new GMP protocols. The \nparvalbumin content, as determined with the ELISA, was 1.0 μg/g carp parvalbumin \nequivalents, and 0.695 μg/g cod parvalbumin equivalents. Inclusion criteria were subjects age 3 \nto 70 years in good health, a convincing clinical hi story of a Type I allergic reaction when fish \nwas consumed, a positive skin pric k test (as large or larger than  the positive control histamine \nskin prick test) to one or more species of fi sh with a commercial ex tract, and a specific IgE \nscore to fish greater than 0.35 kU A/L; both tests had to be perfor med no more than 6 months \npreviously. Isinglass was given with mashed pot atoes at cumulative doses of 50.5 mg over two \nhours (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg ), corresponding to about 10 litres of cask conditioned beer \nor 50 litres of brewery conditioned beer. None of  fifteen patients subjected to this challenge \nprotocol in Denmark and Switzerland reacted to the challenges. \n \nIn a study in France employing a different protoc ol, a cumulative dose of 20 mg isinglass was \ngiven corresponding to the e quivalent of four litres of beer. Inclusion criteria  were “allergic \npatients” age 14 to 18 years, but are not further specified in the dossier. None out of six patients \nchallenged (2/6 skin test positive to fish) had a reaction.  \n \nThe Panel notes that the DBPCFC were performed in food matrices in which isinglass is not \nusually consumed. Alcohol is considered to lo wer the dose that may trigger a food allergic \nreaction in susceptible individuals (Sicherer, 2000). \n \n3.3.3 Food challenge studies with fish gelatine  \n \nThere are no reports of clinical reactions to fish gelatine in relation to food intake, and \nDBPCFC studies have so far been negative, except for one individual reacting to 7.6 g of \ngelatine (NDA, 2004 a and b). Food challenges with gelatine or collagen were not performed in \nthe various studies reporting fi sh collagen and gelatine IgE bi nding, except for the two studies \nreferred below.  \n \nIn a DBPCFC study by a Danish group (Hansen et al ., 2004), no adverse reactions were \nobserved when 30 codfish allergic patients were  given a cumulative dose of 3.6 g of fish \ngelatine derived from codfish skin. A mild r eaction confirmed in a repeated challenge was \nexperienced by one patient when given a cumulative dose of 7.6 g. There was no reaction to the \nnext higher dose.  \n \nIn a French single-blind study (André et al ., 2003) of 100 children and adults with IgE \nreactivity to various species of fish, fish (tuna) skin-derived collagen was used. It was found \nthat 3 out of 100 sera showed IgE binding to tuna  skin-derived fish ge latine. A food challenge \ntest using 5 g of tuna gelatine was negative in these three subjects.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \n \nOn the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass \nused as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals \nunder the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant. \n  \n  \n \n© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  \n Page 9 of 10 \nDOCUMENTATION PROVIDED TO EFSA \n \nDossier submitted by the Brewers of Europe and the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry \nSuppliers Association (BFBi) to the European Commission pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 11 \nof Directive 2000/13/EC as amended by Directive 2000/89/EC, 31 October 2006. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAalberse RC (2000).

Taylor, Ph.D. \nSusan L. Hefle, Ph.D. \nJamie Kabourek, R.D. \n \nFood Allergy Research & Resource Program \nUniversity of Nebraska \nLincoln, NE, USA \n \nOctober 25, 2006 \n \nPrevalence\n \n     Allergy to fish is a common cause of IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. Although \nthe exact prevalence of fish-allergic subjects is not firmly established clinically, fish is \nwidely accepted as one of the most common allergenic foods (Bousquet et al., 1998).  \nFish allergy is expected to be more common in geographic areas where fish is an \nimportant dietary component although other factors beyond dietary preferences appear to \nbe involved in determination of the sensitization to both food and airborne allergens \n(Gislason et al., 1999).  Because of certain nutritional benefits particularly the levels of \nomega-3 fatty acids, dietary advice often emphasizes the increased consumption of fish.  \nThe prevalence of adverse reactions to fish is expected to increase worldwide as \nconsumers increase their consumption of fish and also because of technological advances \nin fish processing which encourage fish consumption in areas further from the seaside \n(O’Neil and Lehrer, 1995).     \n \n     Certainly, fish consumption is reasonably high in the European Union and fish allergy \nis undeniably of considerable clinical importance.  Fish allergy is often identified as one \nof the most common allergenic foods in studies involving pediatric allergy patients \n(Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; Crespo et al., 1992; Sicherer \net al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  Fish is also an important cause \nof food allergy in adults (Helbling et al., 1999; Hansen and Bindslev-Jensen, 1992; \nHansen et al., 1997).  In the general population, fish was responsible for about 10% of all \ncases of food anaphylaxis in a case series reported in France by Moneret-Vautrin and \nKanny (1995).  In an investigation of anaphylaxis episodes in Italy, fish was the most \ncommon cause of food-related anaphylaxis accounting for 30% of all cases (Novembre et \nal., 1998).      \n     A recent survey in the United States indicated that the prevalence of fish allergy in the \npopulation was 0.4% (Sicherer et al., 2004).  Although this estimate was not confirmed \nby clinical studies, the estimate is probably reasonable given the immediate and often \nclinically noteworthy presentation of allergic reactions to fish.  Sensitization to fish was \nreported in 0.2% of the populations of both Iceland and Sweden (Gislason et al., 1999), \nalthough challenges were not done in this study either to confirm the existence of fish \nallergy.  The prevalence of sensitization to fish in Sweden had previously been estimated \nat 0.3% (Björnsson et al., 1996).  These prevalence estimates are in reasonable agreement \nwith one another suggesting that the true prevalence of fish allergy in the general \npopulation is likely to be 0.2-0.4%. \n \nClinical Manifestations\n \n     Symptoms of fish allergy are similar to other IgE-mediated food allergies (Lopata and \nJeebhay, 2001).  Symptoms usually appear immediately (minutes to an hour) following \nexposure and range from mild to life-threatening.  In clinical challenge trials, cutaneous, \ngastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms have been provoked by fish (Helbling et al., \n1999; Sicherer et al., 2000). \n \n     Severe, life-threatening allergic reactions have certainly been triggered by fish on \noccasion.  In a study of 60 patients who presented with severe, near-fatal reactions, fish \nwere identified as the cause of 13% of the cases (Andre et al., 1994).  In another study of \n14 patients with histories of severe allergic reactions to food, four reactions were caused \nby fish intake (Eigenmann and Calza, 2000).  Several fatalities in the USA have been \nattributed to inadvertent ingestion of fish by fish-allergic individuals (Yunginger et al., \n1988; Bock et al., 2001).  In the U.K., three fatalities are attributed to “seafood” which \ncould be fish (Pumphrey, 2000). \n \nNatural History of Fish Allergy\n \n     Clearly, fish allergy can have its onset in young children as documented by challenge \ntrials in pediatric patients (Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; \nCrespo et al., 1992; Sicherer et al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  \nWhile young children often become tolerant of certain allergenic foods, such as milk and \negg, over time, fish allergy is not known to be outgrown. \n \nClinical Cross-Reactivity\n \n     A large number of different fish species have been implicated in allergic reactions to \nfish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Typically, fish-allergic individuals are advised to avoid \ningestion of all species of fish (Helbling et al., 1999).  The Codex Alimentarius \nCommission has recommended the labeling of fish and products thereof because of the \nnotion that fish-allergic individuals are allergic to all species of fish and may also be \nallergic to ingredients derived from fish.  However, while this advice is likely prudent, it \nis not consistent with clinical challenge trials.  In clinical challenge trials conducted in \n 2several clinical centers, fish-allergic patients were sometimes reactive to all fish species \nbut on other occasions were able to tolerate certain species while reacting to others \n(Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Helbling et al., 1999).  In many studies, serological \ncross-reactivity among various fish species is widespread (examples see:  Hansen et al., \n1997; Sten et al., 2004; Helbling et al., 1999; De Martino et al., 1993). \n \nFish Allergens: Parvalbumin as the Major Allergen \n \n     The major allergen in codfish, namely Gad c 1, is a muscle protein that is a member of \nthe parvalbumin family (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  The muscles of all fishes contain \nparvalbumins that are homologous, acidic proteins with molecular weights in the range of \n11-12,000 Da that control the flow of Ca2+ in and out of cells.    Gad c 1 is a very stable \nmolecule, resistant to extremes in pH, temperature or random folding of the molecule \nwhen exposed to dissociating agents (Aas and Elsayed, 1975).  All cod-allergic patients \nreact to Gad c 1 (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  Parvalbumin is found as the major allergen in \nboth Baltic cod (Gad c 1; Elsayed and Aas, 1971) and Atlantic cod (Gad m 1; Das Dores \net al., 2002a).  The allergens from other fish species are also parvalbumins including \nsalmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel (Tra j 1), several species of tuna including bigeye tuna \n(Thu o 1), bluefin tuna, yellowfina tuna and albacore tuna, three species of mackerel (Sco \nj 1, Sco a 1, Sco s 1), pollack (The c 1), and carp (Cyp c 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., \n1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; \nHamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; \nShiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999).  Evidence indicates that parvalbumin is present \nin numerous other species of fish even if the protein has not been isolated and \ndocumented as the major allergen in these species.  Parvalbumin is also the major \nallergen in frog legs and appears to be responsible for cross-reactions between fish and \nfrog (Hilger et al., 2004).  Taken together, this research suggests that parvalbumins are \nmajor pan-allergens in fish and suggests a basis for the cross-reactivity of fish-allergic \nindividuals to many, if not all, species of fish.   \n \n    Curiously, fish-allergic individuals do not always appear to react on challenge to all \nspecies of fish.  Although unexplained, several reasons could exist for this lack of clinical \nreactivity.  Some species of fish may have very low levels of parvalbumin.  Chen et al. \n(2006) noted that tuna had low levels of parvalbumin as detectable with an anti-frog \nparvalbumin antibody that was able to detect parvalbumin in other fish species.  \nSimilarly, fish-allergic patients displayed little or no binding to parvalbumins or proteins \nin that molecular weight range in previous studies with tuna (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., \n1998; James et al., 1997; Lim et al., 2005).  Tuna are among the more commonly \ntolerated fish by individuals with fish allergy (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Torres \nBorrego et al., 2003).  Secondly, parvalbumin is now known to have conformational \nepitopes (Untersmayr et al., 2006).  Therefore, slight differences in the three-dimensional \nstructure of parvalbumin could affect individual patient reactivity.  Also, heat processing \nin particular could affect these conformational epitopes.  Severe heat processing such as \nthe canning of tuna appears to affect allergenicity (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992).  \nFinally, the dark muscles of sardine, horse mackerel, yellowtail, Pacific mackerel, and \nred sea bream were found to contain 4-8 times lower levels of parvalbumin than the white \n 3muscles suggesting another basis for individual patient variability (Kobayashi et al., \n2006).  Similar results were obtained in studies of dark and white muscles of longtail tuna \n(Lim et al., 2005). \n \nFish Allergens – Others\n \n     In addition to the major parvalbumin allergen, some evidence exists for the possible \npresence of other minor allergens in various species of fish including codfish (Aas, 1966; \nAukrust et al., 1978; Dory et al., 1998).  A 41 kDa protein, dissimilar to Gad c 1 with \nrespect to molecular weight, isoelectric point, and proportion of hydrophobic amino acids \nwas able to bind IgE from some cod-allergic individuals (Das Dores et al,, 2002b; \nGalland et al., 1998).  However, the clinical significance of this minor fish allergen has \nnot been established. \n \n    An unidentified IgE-binding protein of 50 kDa was identified in two species of fish, \nhilsa and pomfret, that are popular in India (Das et al., 2005).  Curiously, these fish \nspecies did not appear to contain parvalbumin or any IgE-binding proteins migrating in \nthat molecular weight range.  This immunoblotting study was not confirmed by oral \nchallenges to document the clinical reactivity of the patients who provided the blood \nserum. \n \n     Hamada et al. (2001) identified a high molecular weight allergen detected in bigeye \ntuna muscle as collagen.  However the clinical significance of collagen as a fish allergen \nwas not confirmed by oral challenge of fish-allergic individuals.  In subsequent studies, \nHamada et al. (2003b) noted in IgE-binding studies that 10 of 15 fish-allergic patients \nreacted only to parvalbumin from bigeye tuna, while 2 of 15 fish-allergic patients reacted \nonly to collagen, 2 of 15 patients reacted to both parvalbumin and collagen, and 1 of 15 \npatients reacted to neither protein.  Except for IgE-binding studies, no other evaluations \nwere done (challenges, skin tests, etc.) to document further the allergenicity of collagen.  \nThe sera of the collagen-reactive patients also reacted with collagen from other fish \nspecies including Japanese eel, alfonsin, mackerel, and skipjack (Hamada et al., 2003b). \nThus, collagen appears to be a minor fish allergen, although more studies are needed to \nbetter gauge the prevalence of sensitization to fish collagen.  And, oral challenge studies \nwould be useful to confirm the clinical relevance of fish collagen sensitization. \n  \nIsinglass \n \n     Isinglass is prepared from the swim bladders, also known as fish maws, of various \nspecies of tropical fish.  The fish species most commonly used in the preparation of \nisinglass on a worldwide basis include corvina, purse, and several types of sea catfish.  \nThese are very large fish that also have large maws.  Since these fish are not commonly \nconsumed beyond the local tropical areas in which they are caught, the allergenicity of \nthese species of fish is not documented.  However, research has now confirmed the \npresence of parvalbumin in these species of fish (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, parvalbumin-\nsensitized individuals seem likely to react to ingestion of these fish species although that \nhas not been confirmed by oral challenge trials. \n 4 \n     Isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines for \nmany years.  Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported despite this widespread use. \n \n     Furthermore, fish maws are commonly consumed as food in many parts of the world \nespecially in the form of fish maw soup.  Of the more than 3000 metric tons of fish maws \nthat are consumed each year, only 240 metric tons are used for the production of isinglass \nfor clarification of beers and ales.  The remainder is mostly eaten as fish maw soup.  \nAllergic reactions to fish maw soup have also not been reported.  Although consumption \nof this product occurs primarily in countries where clinical allergy is not a common \nmedical specialty e.g. China, consumption does also occur among Chinese populations in \ncertain EU countries such as the U.K. that have excellent allergy specialization.  Allergic \nreactions to fish maws have also not been reported in any of these EU countries. \nHowever, research has now confirmed that fish maws from the species of fish used to \nproduce isinglass do contain parvalbumin (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, the ingestion of fish \nmaws by fish-allergic individuals should be avoided. \n \n     Collagen is the primary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 \nkD are described for collagen preparations.  Fish maws are composed primarily of \ncollagen.  The processing of the maws is not extensive because the objective is to retain \nthe three-dimensional structure of collagen that allows it to entrap proteins and other \nhaze-producing substances in alcoholic beverages.  Collagen is very insoluble and \nprecipitates quickly upon addition to alcoholic beverages.  Since most of the collagen \nprecipitates, extremely low levels of collagen would be expected to remain in the treated \nbeverages.   \n \n     Since isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major \nallergen from fish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around \nthe presence of small amounts parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major \nallergen in several different species of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and \ntuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; \nBugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et \nal., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., \n1999) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals with fish allergy (Taylor et al., \n2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the muscle and swim bladders of the \nfish species used in the manufacturing of isinglass has now been confirmed.  Thus, the \ndetection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass seems to be a key factor \nin the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material. \n \n     As has now been demonstrated in research funded by the isinglass industry, very low \nbut detectable levels of parvalbumin do exist in isinglass as measured by ELISAs using \nboth anti-carp parvalbumin and anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  The presence of very \nlow levels of parvalbumin in isinglass is not surprising given its presence in the fish \nmaws used to obtain the isinglass.  This same research has documented that the \nparvalbumin content of isinglass can be reduced by washing with phosphate buffer.  \nSince parvalbumin is a highly soluble protein, this finding is also not surprising.  \n 5However, the results documented that parvalbumin could not be eliminated completely \nfrom isinglass by washing.  The 3-dimensional structure of collagen likely allows it to \nentrap some parvalbumin which is then very difficult to remove. \n \n     The ultimate documentation of the safety of isinglass involves various clinical \ninvestigations with fish-allergic individuals.  Furthermore, skin testing of fish-allergic \npatients with fish muscle and fish maw extracts from the relevant species of fish \ndemonstrated that the muscle and maws of these fish do contain parvalbumin because \npositive skin tests were obtained (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, these fish contain \nparvalbumin which is capable of provoking allergic reactions in the fish-allergic \nindividuals.  A number of double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge tests with \ncommercial isinglass have now been completed.  The isinglass used in these clinical trials \nwas equivalent to the isinglass samples that was previously shown to contain trace \nquantities of parvalbumin (FARRP-08-2006).  The exposure doses (up to 30 mg for the \nhighest individual dose and 50.5 mg cumulative dose) were beyond the levels of isinglass \nexposure from cask ale where exposure would be highest (using worst-case assumptions \nabout the amount of residual isinglass, the cumulative challenge dose is equivalent to the \nlevels of isinglass found in 50 liters of beer of 10 liters of cask ale consumed over a 2-hr \ntime period; thus, even high-level consumers of beer and ale are unlikely to reach this \nlevel of exposure).  So far, 15 fish-allergic individuals have been challenged with \nisinglass and none have reacted.  Although oral challenges on additional patients are \nplanned, the conclusion can already be reached that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit \nallergic reactions in the majority of fish-allergic consumers.  Additionally, under a \nseparate clinical protocol, Dr. Fabienne Rance of Toulouse, France challenged 6 fish-\nallergic patients with a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass and no adverse reactions \nwere noted.  This challenge study, while limited to a small number of patients, adds \nsupport to the conclusion that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in the \nmajority of fish-allergic consumers. \n \nExpert Opinion on Isinglass\n \n     In releasing their opinion on isinglass in late 2004, the EFSA panel commented that \nevidence was needed regarding the possible presence of residues of isinglass in treated \nbeers and also of the presence of residues of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Furthermore, the \nEFSA panel requested further research to establish whether isinglass may cause allergic \nreactions in fish-allergic individuals.  DBPCFC trials, in our opinion, would be the best \napproach to address this latter question. \n \n     As noted above, the research sponsored by Brewing Food and Beverage Industry  \nSuppliers Association (BFBi) and the Brewers of Europe is answering all of these  \nquestions.  Research has been conducted to develop a suitable assay for parvalbumin  \nresidues in isinglass.  ELISAs were developed to detect parvalbumin using anti-frog,  \nanti-carp, andanti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  All of these ELISAs were able to detect \nparvalbumins.  Trace quantities of parvalbumin were detected in commercial isinglass \nusing the anti-cod and anti-carp parvalbumin ELISAs.  The ongoing DBPCFCs with \nisinglass on fish-allergic individuals have demonstrated that exposure to low levels of \n 6parvalbumin through the consumption of treated beers and ales is unlikely to be \nallergenic to fish-allergic consumers.   \n \n    Exposure levels to parvalbumin in isinglass used to clarify beers and ales are likely to \nbe extraordinarily low.  Based on current application levels of isinglass in beer for its \nclarification function and based upon the new knowledge of residual parvalbumin levels \nin isinglass, an estimated 0.05 μg of parvalbumin is added per liter of beer.  However, a \nprudent assumption would be that the parvalbumin mostly co-sediments with the \nisinglass.  Since maximum isinglass residues are estimated at 5 mg per liter in unfiltered \nales (cask ale), a reasonable estimate of the level of parvalbumin in ale would be only \n0.0065 μg per liter.  The dosages of isinglass in the ongoing clinical challenge trial are \n0.5, 5.0, 15, and 30 mg which is equivalent to exposure of up to 50 liters of beer (and 10 \nliters of cask ale).  This dosage range covers all reasonable levels of exposure to beer and \nshould document whether isinglass ingestion presents any risk to fish-allergic consumers. \n \n    One remaining concern would relate to fish collagen as a fish allergen.  Evidence \nindicates that sensitization to fish collagen occurs in only a small percentage of fish-\nallergic individuals (4 of 15 in fish-allergic patients studied in Japan).  Oral challenge \ntrials have not been conducted to confirm that allergenicity of fish collagen in fish-\nallergic individuals.  Furthermore, the fish collagen used in the Japanese studies may \ndiffer from isinglass and no evidence exists to indicate that the fish collagen-sensitized \nindividuals would react to isinglass.  In our opinion, fish collagen is likely a minor fish \nallergen but it is likely a very minor allergen based on the lack of reactivity in the fish \ngelatin trials (Hansen et al., 2004).  Individuals with fish collagen sensitivity may be at \nsome risk of ingestion of isinglass but that risk remains unproven especially at low \nchallenge doses. \n  \n     Although isinglass is an ingredient derived from a commonly allergenic food (fish) \nand despite the fact that isinglass contains protein derived from that source (in fact \nisinglass IS protein from fish), the oral challenge trials and other key evidence obtained \nin recent industry-sponsored studies indicates rather clearly that ingestion of isinglass \ndoes not present a risk to fish-allergic individuals.  This information is pivotal to any \ndetermination of need for source labeling of isinglass when it is used in clarification of \nbeers and ales.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAas K.  1966.

The protocol was approved by the\nConsultative Committee for Human Protection in Biomedical Research\n(CPPRB) at Toulouse I on 17th March 2003.\n\nThis was a double-blind study using internationally recognised\nstandard tests. Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the\nstudy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge was\nperformed. For each patient the test was performed twice: once\ncontaining isinglass and once containing the placebo. The order of\nadministration of the tests was determined at random. The test\ncontaining the substance was prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of\nisinglass with 10 grammes of cooked potato.\n\nSix patients with fish allergy, aged 6 to 22 years participated in\nthe study. Fish allergy was determined by oral food challenge or by a\nconvincing clinical history at the time of the study.\n\nSize of skin prick test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE\nspecific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs,\ncumulative reactogenic dose in mg) for fish and isinglass was\ndetermined.\n\nFor this 6 fish allergic patients, we obtained 2 positive skin prick\ntest with isinglass, and 6 negative double-blind, placebo-controlled food\nchallenges with isinglass.\n\nThe study take its course in Toulouse to prospectively obtain 35\nallergic patients and 5 non-allergic.\n\n10/2005\n""}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_14.pdf', 'text': "" \nClinical Study Protocol \n \nProject Title \nStudy into the allergenicity of isinglass, a fi sh derivative, used as a technological aid in the \ndrinks industry \n \nSponsor \nLallemand SA, 19 rue des Briquetiers, 31072 Blagnac Cedex \nRepresented by Claude Espeillac \n \nInvestigator \nDr. Fabienne Rancé \nHospital practitioner (Hôpital des Enfants, Allergy and Pneumology, 330 avenue de Grande \nBretagne, TSA 70034, 31059 Toulouse cedex 9) \n \nThe protocol was approved by the Consultative Committee for Human Protection in \nBiomedical Research (CPPRB) at Toulouse I on 17th March 2003 \n \n \nI. State of Scientific Knowledge  \n \nThe frequency of fish allergy is regarded differently according to geographical location and \nfood habits. In France, fish allergy corresponds to the 5th food allergy in children, and the \n14th food allergy in adults [1, 2]. \n \nFish Allergy \nFish form a very wide group with over 20,000 species. The first publication of fish allergy is \nattributed to Besche in Norway [3]. The in vitro work by Tuft [4] and Aas [5], analysing \nseveral species of fish, notes that fish allergies apply to all species due to cross reactivity \nbetween them. However certain fish allergies trigger allergic reactions only for a particular \nspecies. Fish allergy can therefore be isolated to a single species or include all fish:  it \nappears that 40% of patients tolerate at least one fish species [6, 7]. There is no cross \nreactivity between fish and crustaceans or molluscs. \n \nAllergens are agents capable of provoking pathological reactions in an individual sensitive to \nthis allergen [8]. Allergens are proteins of molecular weight between 10 and 70 kDa [9]. Fish \nallergens belong to the family of parvalbumines, muscular proteins. The different \nparvalbumines are present in the sarcoplasma of fish muscular cells. The major allergen in \ncod was identified by Aas and Elsayed in 1971, then named according to international \nnomenclature Gad c 1 (Gadus callarias)  [10]. This is the M allergen of cod, a muscular \nprotein (sarcoplasma of muscular cells) with MW 12.3 kDa, a family of parvalbumines \nbonding calcium [11]. It is resistant to denaturation and proteolysis. This is an important \nallergen for cod but is not present in all fish species. There are homologies of structure of the \norder of 34% between fish species. Cod also has other allergens, known as intermediary or \nminor, of which one with a molecular weight of 63 kDa is also found in surimi [12]. Recent \nworks have also isolated the major allergen of Atlantic salmon Sal s 1 (Salmo salar) , \nmuscular extract, parvalbumine family [13]. Cooking or smoking reduces the allergenicity. \n \nFish Derivatives in the Drinks Industry \nThe swim bladders of tropical species such as Aridae, Siluridae, Sciaenidae and \nPolynemidae are used for the preparation of a glue or isinglass. This technological aid is \nused essentially to clarify beer but also wines. It is a collagen of molecular weight 800 to \n 11300 kDa. The swim bladder undergoes several processes: drying, granulation, cleaning \n(physical and cold water) and solubilisation. \n \nIn beer, as in wine, isinglass is used at the rate of 1 to 2 grammes per hl. After \nsedimentation, centrifuging and filtration, the highest value found in the end product for \nconsumption is 0.16 ppm. These derivatives are t herefore difficult to implicate in allergies \nbecause of the non-muscular origin in fish, the very high molecular weight far greater than \nfor listed allergens, and above all their presence at infinitesimally small levels. Despite the \ntraditional use dating from the 18th century, to our knowledge there is no information in the \nliterature mentioning an observation of allergy linked to this product. \n \n \n \nII. Purpose of the Study  \n \nNo work has studied the allergenicity of isinglass, used as a technological aid to clarify beers \nand wines. The allergenicity of isinglass has never been shown, although the allergic risk is \nlow. At present we have supposition only. \n \nThe main objective is to specify the allergenicity of fish-derived isinglass present in drinks by \nstandardised double-blind allergy tests, by comparing the results obtained in patients allergic \nto fish and controls. \n \n \n \nIII. Study Protocol  \n \nThis is a double-blind study using internationally recognised standard tests. \n \nInformed consent is obtained before inclusion in the study. A pregnancy test will be \nperformed in girls and young women of child-bearing age. \n \nAll patients will undergo the prick test for isinglass, placebo, different fish species, and \npositive and negative controls. \n \nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge will be performed. For each \npatient the test is performed twice:  once containing isinglass and once containing the \nplacebo. The order of administration of the tests is determined at random. The test \ncontaining the substance is prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of isinglass with 10 \ngrammes of cooked potato. This quantity has been selected to comply with the extreme \nconditions from the following hypotheses: \n \n* the maximum dose of use of isinglass in beer or wine is 2 g/hl, or 20 ppm \n* the maximum residual doses of the technological aid, isinglass, found in filtered beer is \nless than 0.16 ppm or 0.16 mg/l. As a precautionary measure, it is considered that these \ndoses could be 20 times larger, or 3.2 mg/l \n* the quantity of beer ingested is considered as being excessive, 4 litres \n \nThe placebo test contains only 10 g cooked potato. The mixture is given in 3 doses of 1, 3 \nand 6 grammes at 30 minute intervals. The second test (substance or placebo depending on \nrandom allocation) is performed 2 hours after the end of the first test. A clinical examination \nwith measurement is performed before the food challenge. The test is stopped as soon as a \nclinical sign appears. The patient fasts during the test with permission to drink water or apple \njuice. A meal is served 30 minutes after the end of the test. In the case of a reaction, food is \nserved earlier to delay the absorption or dilute the allergen. A doctor and a nurse watch and \n 2report all symptoms. The monitoring covers the skin condition and searches for digestive \nand respiratory signs. Emergency treatment in the case of reaction is prepared before the \nstart of the test and available during the test. A doctor with experience in allergies is present \nthroughout the test. \n \nNumber of patients \n40 patients aged 14 to 18 participate in the study (35 allergic to fish and 5 not allergic). It is \nnecessary to obtain 35 consecutive allergic patients to establish that, in the absence of \npositive tests in the allergic patients, it can be concluded with a confidence interval of 95% \nand an α  risk of 5% that isinglass is non-allergenic for at least 90% of patients with fish \nallergy. The same tests with isinglass performed in just 5 patients not allergic to fish allows \nus to establish the absence of allergy to isinglass also in persons not allergic to fish. \n \nChoice of adolescent or young adult volunteers \nRecruitment is not possible amongst adults for successful performance of this study. The \nfood allergy is three times more common in children than in adults. The study is easier to \nperform in young persons aged 14 to 18 years. The study cannot therefore be performed in \nany other way. \n \nMethods of recruitment \nVolunteers will be recruited by Dr. Rancé at the Children's Hospital, CHU Toulouse, on the \nbasis of 2 groups:  one allergic group and one non-allergic group. The study is carried out \nprospectively to obtain 35 allergic patients and 5 non-allergic. Patients will be selected in the \nsame location and time period (consecutive recruitment). \n \nData analysis \nThe data will be analysed at the Children's Hospital in Toulouse. It concerns the following \nindicators:  signs of fish allergy, size of cutaneous test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE \nspecific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs, cumulative reactogenic \ndose in mg) for fish and isinglass. \n \nThe statistical tests used are chi2 for qualitative variables, Student test for mean \ncomparison, calculation of association force with OR and precision measurement with IC at \n95%. \n \nCivil liability insurance will be concluded by the sponsor, the company Lallemand. \n \n \n \nIV.

Introduction: \n \nIsinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is \nprepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary \ncomponent of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kilo Daltons (kD) are described for \ncollagen preparations.  Parvalbumin, a comparatively small protein from fish muscle, is widely \nconsidered as the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004a).  Fish collagen is not \nconsidered as a major fish allergen.  Although swim bladders are composed primarily of \ncollagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  However, \nthe presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly investigated and \ncertainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Although parvalbumin is \nthought to be a ubiquitous protein in the muscles of all fish species, the presence of parvalbumin \nin the muscles of the fish species used in the preparation of isinglass has not been clearly \ndemonstrated.  Furthermore, the allergenicity of these particular species of fish is also not well \nknown even though another common assumption is that all species of fish are allergenic.  \nSensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-\nsensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  \nThis observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains \ninsufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. \n \nSkin testing was performed with extracts of fish muscle and swim bladders of the fish species \nused in the commercial manufacturing of isinglass.  The primary purpose of skin testing was to \nconfirm the likely presence of parvalbumin in the muscle tissues of these unique species and to \ndocument the presence of parvalbumin in the swim bladders of these species.  This clinical \ninvestigation will serve to demonstrate that these fish and their swim bladders are likely to \nprovoke allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals. \n \nB. Materials: \n \nFish samples Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 6 of 15 \n  \nWhole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers \nused by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1.1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 \nwhole fish).  The whole fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-\nlike tissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was \ndiscarded.  In this report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1.1) and \nthe description maw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.  \n \nTable 1.1 Description of Fish and Fish Maw Samples \n \nSpecies code Description Species \nJ 52/04 Corvina from S. America \n \nCorvina del Lago, Cynoscions \nacoupa \nFL 17/18/05 Singala from India \n \nBlack sea catfish, Arius \ndussumieri \nFL 13/04  Singala from Pakistan \n \nSpotted catfish, Arius maculates \nF 21/05 Purse from Uganda/West Africa \n \nBagrus docmak \nFA 1/2/05 Purse from the Gambia \n \nAfrican sea catfish, Arius \nafricanus \nFA 13/05 Purse from Venezuela \n \nBagre Blanco (white catfish), \nBagrus pseudopimelodus sp. \n \nAll maw samples arrived in dried condition.  The processing background of these samples was \nunknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and \ncovered with mold rendering this particular sample unusable.  Samples of maw and fish (after \nfillets were prepared) were stored until use at -20° C. \n \nExtraction buffer \nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to prepare extracts (see FARRP 08-2006 for details of \noptimization of extraction buffer).  PBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue \nnumber N400500) and contained per liter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na\n2HPO4·2H2O and 0.3 g \nNaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  PBS was sterile and pyrogen free solution.  Containers with \nextraction buffer were only used once after opening.  \n \nGeneral extraction procedure \nFish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a \nprofessional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-\nmix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared \nby stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of PBS for 2 hours at room \ntemperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4°C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml PP-\ntest tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 7 of 15 \n  \nExtracts were filtered over 0.22 μm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES \n[polyethersulfone] sterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic [Corning Inc., \nActon, MA, USA]). After filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml \npolypropylene cryo vials, 12.5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner \nBio-one catalogue number 121263).  Filtration and subdividing were done in a flow chamber.  \nThe extracts were aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at -80°C until distributed to \nthe clinical test sites.  One vial of each extract was prepared for each subject.  The materials were \ndistributed frozen and subsequently held frozen.  Once thawed for use, the material was used for \nonly one subject on one day and then discarded.   \n \nProtein concentration determination\nProtein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using Bradford reagent from \nSigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, catalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as \na standard (Sigma: A7906, minimum BSA content: 98%). \n \nHistamine analysis \nHistamine was measured with a Ridascreen Histamin kit (R1604, r-Biopharm, Darmstadt, \nGermany), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. All samples were measured once, in \nvarious dilutions. This assay is a competitive ELISA for the quantification of histamine in food \n \npH determination \nIn order to avoid cross contact between extracts, pH was determined using pH paper instead of a \npH electrode (pH-Fix 0-14, Machery-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany, catalogue number 921 10) \nwith an estimated accuracy of 0.5 pH unit. \n \nMicrobiological testing\nSkin test extracts were checked for sterility by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Food \nProcessing Center Microbiological Services Laboratory. \n \nParvalbumin concentration\nParvalbumin levels were determined by the ELISA method using anti-carp parvalbumin \nmonoclonal antibody as described in FARRP-07-2006.  The results are expressed in carp \nparvalbumin equivalents. \n \n  C.  Methods: \n \nSubject Selection\nFifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Thus far, 8 fish-allergic subjects have \ncompleted the skin testing challenge.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were: \n \n1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are consumed.  \nSubjects were well characterized fish-allergic children and adults in generally good \nhealth.  Potential subjects were at least three years old and not older than 70 years.   Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 8 of 15 \n  \n  \n2. Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish with a either commercial or \nfresh fish extract AND positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: \n \na).  Recently performed skin prick tests as large or larger than the positive control \nhistamine skin prick test or at least 3 mm in diameter. \nb).  Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. \n \nSince certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of the skin test \nresponses, conventional antihistamines were discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing, long \nacting antihistamines were discontinued for at least 7 days prior to skin testing, and topical \nsteroids were discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.  \nTricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin were withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing. \nTopical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and were avoided at skin test sites.  \n \nSkin testing procedure\n \nSkin prick testing was done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the cleansed \nvolar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a \nsterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same \nfashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution \n(1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify subjects for this study were either \nfresh cod extracts or commercial products expressly prepared for diagnostic skin testing.  The \ncommercial extract was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.   Experimental \nskin test materials were prepared by the procedures described above. \n \nSkin prick tests for fish extracts were judged and recorded based on the size of the wheal (raised \nwelt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as compared to the positive and \nnegative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-inspected at 30 minutes.   The SPT is \ndeemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests and needed \nto be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT or at least 3 mm in diameter to be \nconsidered positive.   \n \nEthics board approvals were obtained from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and from the \nparticipating clinical centers. \n \nD.  Results: \n \nProtein and parvalbumin content\nThe skin test extracts from fish muscle and swim bladders (maws) had somewhat lower protein \nlevels than reported previously in FARRP-08-2006 probably because of the ultrafiltration for \nsterilization.  The protein and parvalbumin levels are shown in Table 1.2. \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 9 of 15 \n  \n \nTable 1.2.

As noted, skin testing of 7 additional individuals is planned in Denmark and \nEngland but those results are not yet available. \n \nAll eight fish-allergic subjects had positive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish fillet \nmuscles of each of the fish noted in Table 1.2.  Seven of the eight fish-allergic subjects had \npositive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish swim bladders (maws) of each of the fish \nnoted in Table 1.2.  The eighth subject had positive skin test reactions to 5 of the 6 swim bladder \nextracts but had a negative response to a prick test with the extract of swim bladder of  FA 13/05 \n(Bagrus pseudopimelodus sp.). \n \nE. Discussion \n \nThese results indicate rather clearly that the fish muscle of these tropical fish species contain \nparvalbumin and that the parvalbumin is cross-reactive with IgE antibodies in European subjects \nsensitized to fish eaten more commonly in Europe.  This result is not particularly surprising \nbecause parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen (Taylor et al., 2004a) that should be found \nin the edible muscle tissues of all fish species.  However, while the levels of protein in the fish \nmuscle extracts were reasonably consistent from species to species, the levels of apparent \nparvalbumin were quite variable.  In earlier reports, three different ELISAs for parvalbumin \nwere developed and shown to have differing specificities for parvalbumin from various species \nof fish.  Thus, this result should be attributed, at least in part, to possible specificity issues arising \nfrom use of the monoclonal anti-carp parvalbumin antibody in this particular ELISA.  While the \nallergenicity of the muscle tissue of these species of fish has not been confirmed by oral Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 10 of 15 \n  \nchallenge tests, the presence of parvalbumin in these tissues strongly suggests that fish-allergic \nindividuals should avoid consumption of the muscle tissue of these fish. \n \nThe extracts of the swim bladders had considerably lower protein levels by comparison to the \nmuscle extracts (Table 1.2).  Certainly, this is due to the insoluble nature of the collagen, the \npredominant protein in swim bladders which is thus unlikely to be present in large amounts in \nthe saline extracts.  Parvalbumin levels in the extracts of the swim bladders are lower (in 5 of 6 \ncases) than parvalbumin levels in muscle extracts.  However, this investigation confirms that the \nswim bladders of these 6 species of fish contain parvalbumin.  While the swim bladder of the \noyster toadfish has previously been known to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), the \nubiquity of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders of various species had not been thoroughly \ninvestigated.  These results demonstrate that parvalbumin is present in swim bladders from all of \nthese species so perhaps parvalbumin is ubiquitously present in fish swim bladders.    \n \nThe swim bladder extract of the black sea catfish contained higher levels of apparent \nparvalbumin than did the muscle extract of that species.  However, that result could also be a \nfunction of the comparative specificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody.  The parvalbumin \ntypes in swim bladder and muscle could be different leading to variable recognition by the \nvarious antibodies to parvalbumin.  It would be interesting to repeat this result with the anti-frog \nand anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies but we have not yet done that experiment. \n \nSince fish swim bladders also contain parvalbumin, the ingestion of fish maws is likely \nhazardous for fish-allergic individuals.  Fish maw soup is consumed in several countries \nincluding China.  Again, oral challenge trials would be necessary to confirm the hazards \nassociated with fish maws but caution would certainly be prudent based upon the existing \nresults. \n \nSince the muscle tissue and maws of these fish species used to manufacture isinglass contain \nparvalbumin, the allergenicity of isinglass is likely related to residual levels of parvalbumin in \ncommercial isinglass.  As previously noted (see FARRP-08-2006), very low levels of residual \nparvalbumin were found in isinglass.  The following section will describe the results of clinical \noral challenge trials with isinglass on fish-allergic individuals which will determine the \nallergenic hazard, if any, associated with ingestion of isinglass by such individuals. \n \nII.

Although swim bladders are composed primarily of \ncollagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  \nSensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-\nsensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  \nThis observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains \ninsufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. \n   \nA clinical challenge trial was needed to confirm this suspicion that ingestion of typical quantities \nof isinglass does not pose a hazard to fish-allergic individuals.  In this section of the report, the \nresults of oral challenges of 15 fish-allergic individuals are presented.  \n \nB.  Materials & Methods: \n \nSubject Selection\nTwenty-nine fish-allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based on the guidelines put \nforth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the threshold doses for allergenic foods:  \nhow much is too much?” (Taylor et al., 2004b).   Thus far, 15 subjects have completed the oral \nchallenge trials.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were: \n \n1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are \nconsumed.  Subjects were well characterized fish-allergic children and adults \nin generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  Subjects with \nsevere reactions to fish were not excluded. \n \n2.   Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish AND positive specific \nIgE to fish that meet the following criteria: \n \na).  Recently performed skin prick test as large or larger than the positive \ncontrol histamine skin prick test, or at least 3 mm in diameter. \nb). Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. \n \nThe subjects enrolled in this challenge trial ceased taking all prescribed medications related to \ntheir allergies for suitable withdrawal periods before commencement of the challenge trial.  In \nparticular, H\n1 anti-histamines with a short duration of activity were withheld for a minimum of \n48 hours.  Hydroxyzine was withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 12 of 15 \n  \nantagonists were withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti-histamines (cetirizine) \nwere withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of patients with co-existing or food-induced \nasthma, short-acting inhaled or oral beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics were continued up \nto 6 hours before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists were stopped 12 hours before challenge.  \nChromones (cromolyn and nedocromil) were withheld for 48 hours.  Inhaled steroids or oral \ncorticosteroids were continued in patients where prescribed, although patients with serious \nasthma were not included in this challenge.   \n \nCaffeine and alcohol were also excluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  Females of child-\nbearing age were required to have a negative pregnancy test each day that oral challenges were \ngiven. \n \nOral challenge procedure\nOral challenges were performed in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion on two separate \ndays (randomly assigned placebo and isinglass challenge days).  The isinglass challenge material \nwas a commercially available product supplied by worldwide isinglass manufacturers and \nrepresentative of isinglass as manufactured currently.  This isinglass material has also been \nanalyzed for residual parvalbumin (see FARRP-08-2006).  The isinglass was disguised in \nmashed potatoes and the inability to distinguish between potatoes containing isinglass and \nplacebo potatoes was confirmed by sensory evaluation.  Subjects were challenged with four \ndoses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned mashed potato preparation.  The doses were 0.5 mg, \n5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg isinglass in about 40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing \namount.  Four portions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass were given on a different day \nand act as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses were given at 30-minute \nintervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo were provided (all in blinded fashion) in the \nevent that a dose needed to be repeated.  Doses could be repeated if there was a question about \nthe objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction was observed after the duplicate dose, the \nnext dose was given. \n \nDehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge material were pre-weighed into challenge containers \nin a food grade facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Preparation of the challenge \nmaterial at the clinical investigation site required the addition of nearly boiling water to the \nchallenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, allowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, \nmixing and then presenting to the subject.  The challenge order was randomized for each subject \nand all challenge materials blinded before shipping to the clinical investigation site.   \n \n \nC.

One subject had a mild \nadverse reaction (skin rash) to placebo but not to isinglass.  This response was the only objective \nsymptom encountered during the oral challenge trials.  Three subjects each experienced mild \nsubjective reactions (e.g. palatal itching) to placebo and isinglass at initial doses used in the trial.  \nHowever, these symptoms resolved quickly and further doses of either placebo or isinglass were \nadministered without these or other symptoms developing.  Thus, these subjective reactions do \nnot appear to be related to the challenge trial.  \n \nD.  Discussion: \n \nWhile our ultimate aim is to enroll 29 fish-allergic patients in the isinglass challenge trial, only \n15 subjects have completed the challenges so far.  However, none of these patients has reacted \nadversely to the administration of a cumulative challenge dose of 50.5 mg of isinglass.  This \namount of isinglass is far in excess of the amount that might be achieved with beer and wine \nconsumption.  Cask ale, under certain circumstances, may allow higher levels of isinglass \nexposure but the 50.5 mg cumulative dose was intended to represent a worst-case scenario that is Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 15 of 15 \n  \neven beyond the exposure levels that likely occur with cask ale.  Thus, this challenge trial \nconfirms that fish-allergic individuals may safely consume alcoholic beverages that have been \ntreated with isinglass. \n \nIII.

Without use of clarifying agents, these alcoholic beverages \nwould be cloudy rather than clear.  Because the collagen molecules are amphoteric, the \nnegative charges attract and bind to yeast cells while the positive charges attract and \nbind to proteins.  Furthermore, isinglass is highly insoluble and its addition results in \nimmediate clarification of the liquid.  Clarification can be achieved with a rather low level \nof addition of isinglass, typically in the range of 0.001% to 0.002% (2).  In most cases, \nthe isinglass and the components that precipitate with it are removed by filtration or \ncentrifugation before packaging of the beverage.  In those situations, exposure to \nisinglass in the beverage as consumed would be quite low because the majority of it is \nlikely removed.  Residue levels in filtered beer have been measured in the range of 0.02 \n– 0.16 parts per million (ppm) or mg/l (2).  Cask ale, a popular beverage in the U.K., is \nan exception where the precipitated mass is left in the bottom of the cask.  In this case, \nisinglass exposure can be higher for consumers of cask ale especially as the cask is \ntipped and some sludge from the bottom of the cask may be intermixed with the ale.  \nThe levels of residual isinglass in cask ale have not been measured and, as noted, are \nlikely to be variable from glass to glass. \n \nBecause it is derived from a major allergenic food source, namely fish, the allergenicity \nof isinglass to fish-allergic individuals is a question of interest.  Fish are considered to \nbe one of the most commonly allergenic foods in the human diet (1).  Fish and \ningredients derived from fish are included on lists of commonly allergenic foods in \ncountries in which such lists exist including the US, EU., Canada, and Australia/New \nZealand (1).  Isinglass is certainly an ingredient derived from fish although its \nallergenicity has not been established.  Thus, regulations in these countries and regions \nwould require that isinglass be labeled on the alcoholic beverages and that its fish origin \nalso be declared unless an exemption could be granted.  Some countries and regions \nincluding the EU and US provide for the possibility of labeling exemptions in cases \nwhere the lack of allergenicity of the ingredient can be established. \n \nFish-allergic individuals are typically advised to avoid ingestion of all species of fish and \ningredients derived from fish.  While it has been observed clinically that some fish-\nallergic individuals are tolerant of certain species of fish, the basis for this tolerance has \nnot been elucidated (3).  In other clinical studies, fish-allergic individuals appear to be \nsensitive to all species of fish (4,5).  The major allergen of fish has been identified as \nparvalbumin, a muscle protein (6).  Parvalbumin appears to be a pan-allergen that \nexists in the edible muscle tissue of all fish (7,8).  Parvalbumin has been described to \n 1also occur in the swim bladders of some fish species (9) but the level and allergenicity \nof this parvalbumin has not been determined.  A few reports exist of other higher \nmolecular weight protein allergens from fish (7, 10).  Collagen isolated from fish muscle, \nnot swim bladder, has been identified as one of these allergens (10).  However, only a \nfew Japanese patients have thus far been identified with IgE reactivity to fish collagen \n(7) and its allergenicity by oral challenge has not been documented.  Furthermore, the \ncomparative lack of allergenicity of another fish collagen product, fish gelatin made from \nfish skins, in fish-allergic subjects has been documented (11). \n \nIsinglass may contain residual parvalbumin although the level of parvalbumin in \nisinglass has not been determined analytically (this is another research objective that is \nbeing simultaneously pursued).  Despite centuries of use in wines, ales, and beers, \nallergic reactions to isinglass have not been reported in the clinical literature (1).  The \nobjective of this clinical trial is to determine the potential allergenicity of commercially \nproduced isinglass in fish-allergic individuals. \n \nObjective:  Determine the allergenicity of isinglass by performing double blind placebo \ncontrolled food challenges in fish allergic individuals. \n \nOverview:  Twenty-nine fish allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based \non the guidelines put forth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the \nthreshold doses for allergenic foods:  how much is too much?” (12).   Oral food \nchallenges will be performed according to the following protocol by clinical collaborators \nwith challenge materials supplied by FARRP.  The amount of isinglass used for the \nchallenges will reflect typical exposure amounts. \n \nClinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the \nuse of human subjects at their specific institutions.  \n \nStatistical Design:  The proposed sample size of 29 subjects is based upon the \nassumption that no subjects will react at the lowest challenge dose and assuming that if \na subject reacts to one dose, then they will also react to higher doses.  If 29 subjects \nare challenged and a dose is identified where 0/29 subjects reacts, then there is 95% \nconfidence that 90% of fish-allergic individuals will not react to this amount of isinglass \nor less.  The sample size of 29 is based upon the hypothesis that the reaction rate is \nequal to 10%. \n \nData analysis plan \nWe will attempt to set a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) as well as estimate \nthe false positive rate and the proportion of truly sensitive individuals.  Data will be \ncaptured as reaction / no reaction for each dose of active challenge material. The \nplacebo reaction rate will be taken into account as follows: \n 2 \nSubject ID Placebo \n1 \nPlacebo \n2 \nPlacebo  \n3 \nPlacebo  \n4 \nIsinglass \n0.5 mg \nIsinglass \n5 mg \nIsinglass \n15 mg \nIsinglass \n30 mg \n1 - - - - - - - + \n2 - - - - - - - - \n3 - - - + - - + NA,+ \n4 - - - - - - - + \n…29 - - - + - - - - \nTotal \nReactions \n0/29 0/29 0/29 2/29 0/29 0/29 1/29 3/29 \nNA= not administered, assuming that if a subject reacts to one dose, then he or she will \nalso react to higher doses, these are scored as + \n \nThe number of positive and negative placebo and active reactions will be tallied and \nentered into the formula of Briggs et al. (13) and calculated as outlined in Hansen et al. \n(11) and illustrated below. \n \n \nThe structure of data for calculations \n    \n      \n  Active  \n  negative positive  \nnegative a b a + b \nPlacebo positive c d c + d \n  a + c b + d a + b + c + d \n      \n    \n    \nc + d \nThe estimate of the false positive rate:  a + b + c + d \n    \n    \nb - c The estimate of the proportion of \nTruly sensitive subjects:  \na + b \n \n \nThe above formula will allow for an estimate of a false positive rate (0.069 in the above \nexample) and an estimate of the proportion of truly sensitive individuals (0.037 in the \nabove example).   None of the 29 subjects in the above example reacted to the 5 mg \nchallenge dose therefore 5 mg would be the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL).  \n \n \n \n \n 3Subject Criteria:  Potential subjects must have: \n \n1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are \nconsumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and \nadults in generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  \nSubjects with severe reactions to fish should be included so that this segment \nof the fish-allergic population is not overlooked. \n  \n2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a \npan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract \nprovides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial \nextract AND\n positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: \n \n a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months \n previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters \n need to be reported in millimeters and be as  large, or larger than the positive \n control histamine skin prick test. \n b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach \n since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of \n fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 \n kU\nA/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual \n specific IgE score in kU A/L must be reported. \n \n  3. Subjects enrolled in this challen ge trial should cease taking all prescribed   \n   medications related to their allergie s for suitable withdrawal periods before  \n   commencement of the challe nge trial.  In particular, H1 anti-histamines with a  \n   short duration of activity should be withheld for a minimum of 48 hours.    \n   Hydroxyzine is to be withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor \n   antagonists should be withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti- \n   histamines (cetirizine) should be withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of  \n   patients with co-existin g or food-induced asthma, short-acting inhaled or oral  \n   beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics could be continued up to 6 hours  \n   before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists should be stopped 12 hours   \n   before challenge.  Chromones (cromo lyn and nedocromil) should be withheld  \n   for 48 hours.  Inhaled ster oids or oral corticosteroids would be continued in  \n   patients where prescri bed, although patients with serious asthma should not  \n   be included in this challenge.  If pati ents are taken off of routine medications,  \n   the challenge trials must be conducted in a manner that any reactions arising  \n   from the withdrawal of medications can be distinguished from true reactions  \n   to the food incorporated into the challenge trial.   \n \n  4. Caffeine and alcohol should also be ex cluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  \n   Females of child-bearing age must hav e a negative pregnancy test each day  \n   that oral challenges are given. \n \n 4Methods and Procedures: \n \nSkin Prick Test (SPT) \n  \nSkin prick testing is done by placing a drop of commercially prepared fish extract (from \nany fish species or mixture of fish species as noted above) on the cleansed forearm or \nback of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  \nNegative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same fashion with saline \nsolution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution, respectively.  \nAll of the SPT materials are commercial products and are expressly prepared for \ndiagnostic skin testing.  \n \nSkin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the \nwheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as \ncompared to the positive and negative control skin tests after 15-30 minutes.   A SPT is \ndeemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin tests.  A small \namount of reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account \nwhen judging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the \nwheal at the site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening.  \nThe size of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 15 mm or larger \nwheal diameter, with a flare around the wheal that is hardly visible to one that may have \na diameter of 50 mm or more.  This wheal and flare response to fish should be at least \nas large as the positive histamine control SPT.  Extremely large wheal and flare \nreactions are uncommon when using commercially prepared skin test reagents, but may \noccur on occasion.  The result is recorded by measuring the diameter of the wheal and \nthe diameter of the wheal and flare.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should \nbe noted (i.e. pseudopodia). \n \nThe size of the wheal and flare is not necessarily indicative of the severity of the \nreaction that may be experienced when fish is ingested, or the amount of fish required \nto cause a reaction.    \n \nBlood draw (venipuncture) \n \nA sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm for RAST testing.  The blood will \nbe processed into serum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the \nserum can be submitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific \nIgE to fish requires only a few milliliters of serum. \n \nOral Challenge Description \n \nOral challenges will occur in a clinical setting allowing prompt medical treatment if \nnecessary during the challenge.  Subjects will be monitored by qualified medical \npersonnel.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject will have a severe reaction \nduring skin prick testing or oral challenge, a code cart or special emergency supplies \nincluding intubation equipment and defibrillator will be available and epinephrine and \n 5other medications will be administered according to the level and severity of reaction.  \nClinical Investigators may deem it necessary for some subject to have an intravenous \nline placed for rapid medical treatment.   Standard biophysical measurements will be \nmade before each dose: pulse, blood pressure.  If appropriate, some clinical \ninvestigators may wish to monitor peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), but this is not \nrequired.   Subjective symptoms should be recorded on the FARRP Isinglass Study \nChallenge Data Sheet, but the challenge should continue until objective symptoms are \nobserved, unless the subject cannot tolerate the subjective symptoms.  Investigators \nmay wish to consider photographs or digital images to document visible reactions (i.e. \nskin reactions). \n \nSubjects will be challenged with four doses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned \nmashed potato preparation.  The doses will be 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg \nisinglass in 20-40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing amount.  Four \nportions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass will be given on a different day and \nact as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses will be given at 30-minute \nintervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo will be provided (all in blinded fashion) \nin the event that a dose needs to be repeated.  Doses should be repeated if there is a \nquestion about the objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction is observed after \nthe duplicate dose, the next dose should be given.  \n \nThe isinglass challenge material will be a commercially available product supplied by \nThe Allied Brewery Trading Association of the U.K which represents most of the \nisinglass manufacturers of the world.  Dehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge \nmaterial will be pre-weighed into challenge containers in a food grade facility at the \nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln by the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator. \n \nPreparation of the challenge material at the clinical investigation site will require the \naddition of nearly boiling water to the challenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, \nallowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, mixing and then presenting to the \nsubject.  Newly purchased Pyrex containers and graduated cylinders will be provided to \nheat and measure the water.  These containers will require cleaning by clinical \ninvestigator prior to each challenge prepared and used exclusively for this study.  The \nchallenge may be served in the same container in which the material is rehydrated. The \nclinical investigator will need a method of heating the water.  A microwave oven works \nwell for this as does an electric tea kettle. \n \nChallenge materials will be randomized, blinded and the challenge order randomized \nbefore shipping to the clinical investigation site. \n \nBenefits  \n \nThe direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not isinglass is an allergy risk for \nhim or her.  Results from all of the subjects will be used to determine labeling policies \nfor isinglass-containing products. \n 6  \nRisks \n \nSkin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in \nallergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (15-\n20). The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito \nbite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a \nfew minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. \n \nThe drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks \ncan occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may \nremain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally \nassociated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur \nat the site of the venipuncture.  \n \nThe subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the \nskin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin \nprick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin \nprick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered \naccording to the level and severity of reaction.  \n \nThe precise risk of anaphylaxis from the food challenge is unknown.  In a recent study \nexamining the risks of oral food challenges, 253 oral challenges resulted in reactions \nwith foods to which the subject was allergic (21).  Most reactions to all foods in this \nstudy were classified as mild to moderate with 28% of the reactions categorized as \nsevere.  The lowest median dose associated with a severe allergic reaction was 0.6 \ngrams of milk.  There was a similar risk of severe reactions regardless of the food in the \nchallenge.  Overall, all reactions were reversible with short-acting histamine with or \nwithout epinephrine, β-agonists, and/or corticosteroids.  No subjects required \nhospitalization.  The authors note that there are risks associated with food challenges, \nbut these risks are reasonable when challenges are performed under the guidance of \nand experienced practitioner in a properly equipped setting.  Nursing and physician staff \nwill be present during the oral food challenge.  In the event that the subject has a \nreaction during the oral food challenge, emergency supplies and medications will be \navailable and be administered according to the level and severity of reaction. \n   \nRecruiting Procedures \n \nEach clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for their location.  \nSuggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, and \nrecruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also be \nsent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include examples \nof letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human subjects use \ncommittee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical investigator’s \nlocal human subjects use committee. \n \n 7Compensation \nA per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site \nshould propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, \nsupplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal \npreparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  \nCompensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when \nallowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  Clinical investigators may want to recompense the \nsubject for completing specific parts of the study: for example, a set amount would be \ngiven for undergoing skin prick tests or blood draw; an additional amount would be \ngiven for completing the oral challenge. The compensation amount is to be determined \nby and paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per \nsubject cost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  \nInstructions for invoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are \ndistributed to the clinical investigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without \nreceipt of deliverables by FARRP. \n \nInformed Consent Forms \nEach clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to \nconform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use \ncommittee.   \n \nObtaining Informed Consent \nThis procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each \nclinical investigator. \n \nMaintaining Confidentiality \nEach clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP \nIsinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Isinglass Study Challenge \nData Sheet “will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain subject \nnames, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to FARRP.  At the \nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” \nand the “Isinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” will be stored in a locked file.  Only the \nClinical Study Coordinator and the Co-Directors of FARRP will have access to this \ninformation.  In publications or reports using information collected from this work, the \nsubjects will either be referred to as a collective or be identified by a subject number or \nother appropriate blinded designation. \n \nCopy of Questionnaire and Datasheets   \nCopies of the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP \nIsinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” are included for submittal with clinical \ninvestigators’ proposal to their institute’s human subjects use committee. \n \nFunding  \nThis project is being funded by the Food Allergy Research & Resource Program at the \nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE USA.  If you require a letter indicating this, \ncontact Julie A. Nordlee, FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator.   \n 8 \nContract \nEach clinical investigator will be asked to sign a contract with FARRP and the University \nof Nebraska which will detail the deliverables to FARRP, the agreed upon per subject \ncost and details regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement between FARRP \nand the clinical investigator and their institution. \n \nData Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) \nA two-member board will be established consisting of two allergists with experience in \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will \nbe reported to the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator by fax, phone and email within 24 \nhours.  A standardized form to report these events will be provided to the clinical \ncollaborators with the challenge material instructions. The FARRP Clinical Study \nCoordinator will immediately fax or email the SAE report form to the Board.  The Board \nwill convene a teleconference within 48 hours to discuss what actions, if any, should be \ntaken.  The Board will have 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments \nto the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators.   The Board will \nalso be charged with examining, discussing and producing a short report of its findings \nfor all adverse event data to be supplied to the Board by the FARRP Clinical Study \nCoordinator.  The Board will convene a teleconference or electronic mail \ncorrespondence every three months until the completion of the study or when 50% of \nthe subjects have completed the challenges, which ever occurs first.  The Board will \nhave 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments to the FARRP Clinical \nStudy Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators. \n \n1. Each member of the Board will be paid a stipend of $150 per meeting.  \n \n2. In the event that the death of a subject occurs during the course of the study, \nthe FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator will be contacted immediately and all \nprocedures at all clinical study sites will cease until further notice.  Other SAEs \nwill be evaluated as indicated above and according to the SAE Report form. \n \nDefinition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) \nA serious adverse event or reaction is defined as any adverse event occurring at any \ndose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution.  This \nincludes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: \n \n• Death:  A death occurring during the study must be reported. \n• Life-threatening:  Any adverse therapy ex perience that places the subject, in the \nview of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. \n• Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. \n• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity. \n• Congenital anomaly/birth defect. \n• Other conditions as specified in the protocol. \n• An event that requires intervention to pr event permanent impairment or damage.  An \nimportant medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require \n 9hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical \njudgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical \nintervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. \nDefinition of an Adverse Event (AE) \n• Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject temporally associated with the \nchallenge material, whether or not considered related to the challenge material.   \n• An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable or unintended sign or symptom temporally \nassociated with the challenge material. \n• These occurrences should be reported on the Challenge Data Sheet. \n \n \n \n 10References \n \n1.

DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT \n \nObjective:  By means of routine methods used by clinicians in allergy practice, \ndetermine the potential allergenicity of unique fish species by performing skin prick tests \nin fish allergic individuals. \n \nBackground:  Though not specifically confirmed by clinical studies, fish allergic \nindividuals are believed to be potentially reactive to all species of fish (1).  Hundreds of \nfish species exist worldwide that are used for human consumption or to make food \ningredients including fermented fish sauces, isinglass, fish gelatin, fish oil, and collagen. \nSpecifically, this research project is part of a larger effort aimed at assessing the \npotential allergenicity of isinglass.  Isinglass is a fish-derived ingredient used in the \nclarification of beers, wine, ales, and champagnes (1).  Isinglass is obtained from the \nswim bladders of certain species of fish, usually large tropical fish, including croaker, \nthreadfin, corvina, and others (1).  Isinglass is composed primarily of collagen (2).  \nEdible fish muscle contains an allergenic protein called parvalbumin, a calcium-binding \nprotein involved in muscle contraction (3).  Parvalbumin is thought to exist in the muscle \ntissues of all fish species and has specifically been found in a large number of fish \nspecies including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel, tuna, and others (3-8).  Parvalbumin is \ntheorized to be the pan-allergen that is responsible for fish allergies and its ubiquity in \nfish muscle is the reason why fish-allergic individuals are believed to react to all fish \nspecies.  Moreover, parvalbumin is known to exist in the swim bladders of at least one \nfish species [toadfish] (9).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in the unique fish \nspecies used to make isinglass or in the swim bladders from these fish has not been \nestablished.  The commercial process for making isinglass likely results in the removal \nof some of the water-soluble parvalbumin.  Skin testing with extracts prepared from the \nflesh and swim bladders of these unique fish will provide additional information to \nsupport or refute the premise that fish allergic individuals could be potentially reactive to \nall species of fish.  Skin testing would be useful in ascertaining whether parvalbumin is \npresent in the swim bladders of these unique species.  \n \nOverview:  Fifteen fish allergic individuals will be selected.  The subject selection will be \nbased on a history of allergy to fish species commonly consumed such as cod, salmon \nand tuna, etc. and positive skin prick tests to commercial skin test extracts prepared \nfrom these same types of fish.  The selected subjects will be skin prick tested with \nmaterials prepared from the flesh and swim bladders of the unique species of fish used \nto make isinglass, that are not commonly ingested in the United States or European \nUnion.   \n \nClinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the \nuse of human subjects at their specific institutions.   Copies of these approvals must be \nprovided to FARRP before skin-test materials will be provided.  These approvals will be \nprovided to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln IRB when received. \n 12.  METHODS AND PROCEDURES \n \nProcedure Overview:  Qualified subjects will be skin prick tested with 12 extracts \nderived from different unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders as well as a \npositive control solution (1% histamine), and negative control solution [extraction buffer \ncontaining sodium chloride and phosphates at or near neutral pH (7.0-7.5)].  Time \nrequired for the subject will be 1.5-3 hours.   \n \nClinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols to the ethics or human \nsubjects use committee and receive approval for the use of human subjects at his or her \nspecific institutions.  The following clinicians have expressed an interest in participating \nas our collaborators: \n \nDr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen \nOdense University Hospital \nOdense, DENMARK \nFWA00004088 \n \nDr. Richard Pumphrey \nManchester Royal Infirmary \nManchester, UNITED KINGDOM \nFWA00006996 \n   \n \nSpecific Methods and Procedures: \n \nSkin prick testing and blood draws are needed to qualify subjects for the study. \n \nSkin Prick Test (SPTs) \n  \nSkin prick testing is done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the \ncleansed volar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking \nthe skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are \ndone in the same fashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract \nand histamine solution (1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify \nsubjects for this study should be commercial products and are expressly prepared for \ndiagnostic skin testing.  The commercial extract will be used in accordance with the \nmanufacturer’s instructions.   Other skin test materials will be provided and prepared in \nthe laboratory by the procedures described below. \n \nSkin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the \nwheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as \ncompared to the positive and negative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-\ninspected at 30 minutes.   The diameters of wheal and flare reactions will be measured \nin millimeters and recorded for each time point.  A SPT is deemed positive by \ncomparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests.  A small amount of \n 2reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account when \njudging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the wheal at \nthe site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening (14).  The \nsize of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 14 mm or larger wheal \ndiameter (14), with a flare around the wheal that may range from hardly visible to one \nthat may have a diameter of 50 mm or more.  The wheal and flare response to fish \nextracts should be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT to be \nconsidered positive.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should be noted (i.e. \npseudopodia). \n \nBlood draw (venipuncture) \n \nA sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm.  The blood will be processed into \nserum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the serum can be \nsubmitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific IgE to fish \nrequires only a few milliliters of serum. \n  \nPreparation of Non-Commercial Skin Prick Test Materials \n \nFish extracts of the flesh and swim bladders of six selected unique fish species (see \nfollowing table) will be prepared by PodiCeps BV, Houten The Netherlands.  Extracts \nwill be prepared using the most optimal extraction buffer.  At least 100 ml of extract will \nbe prepared for each species by the following steps.  Sterility checks of the extracts will \nbe performed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Food Science and \nTechnology Microbiological Services Laboratory.  Histamine analysis will be performed \nusing Neogen Corporation Veratox® Quantitative Histamine Test in the laboratory of Dr. \nSue Hefle, Food Allergy Research and Resource Program, Department of Food \nScience and Technology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \n \n1.  Crude extracts of each unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders will be   \n  prepared using extraction buffer containi ng sodium chloride and phosphates at or \n  near neutral pH (7.0-7.5).  One part fi nely chopped or ground fish flesh or swim  \n  bladder will be mixed with 10 parts extrac tion buffer and mixed overnight at 4-  \n  6°C.  Before the extraction procedur e the swim bladders will be milled to a   \n  nominal size of 4 cm and washed in a 2% hydrogen peroxide solution for 30   \n  minutes before rinsing and drying. \n2. The crude extract will be clar ified by centrifugation. \n3.  The supernatant material resulting from  the centrifugation will be sterilized by   \n  filtration using 0.22 µm  sterile  memb ranes in a laminar flow chamber and    \n  packaged aseptically in the chamber. \n4.  The protein content of  the sterilized extract will be determined using the Bradford  \n  method (15).  If necessary the extracts  will be diluted using sterile extraction   \n  buffer in a laminar flow chamber to a pr otein content within the range reported in  \n  commercially available skin pr ick test extracts for fish. \n5.  The resulting material will be aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at \n  -80°C until distributed to the clinical test  sites.  One vial of each extract will be  \n 3  prepared for each subject.  The materi als will be distributed frozen and     \n  subsequently held frozen.  Once thaw ed for use, the material will be     \n  used for only one subject on one day and then discarded.   \n6.  Histamine content will be determined using immunoassay methods (Neogen   \n  Corp, Lansing, MI).  To assure that the unique fish starting materials have not  \n  been subjected to spoilage conditions the level of histamine in the non-    \n  commercial fish skin prick test extracts must be less than 0.005% (16).  If the   \n  level of histamine is greater than or equal to 0.005% new materials will be    \n  obtained and the extractions remade. \n7.  Information/fact sheets of each unique fi sh flesh and swim bladder extract will be  \n  prepared and shipped to the clinical co llaborators together with the extracts.   \n  Facts sheets will contain information on: pr otein content, salt content, pH and   \n  histamine content. \n \nUnique Fish Species to be Used for Fish Flesh and Swim Bladder Extracts \n \nNAME COMMON NAME ORIGIN SCIENTIFIC NAME \nPakistan Singala Spotted Catfish Pakistan Arius maculates \nIndian Singala Blacktip Sea Catfish India Arius dussumieri \nAfrican Purse African Sea Catfish Mauritania/The Gambia Arius africanus \nEast African Semutundu  Bagrid Catfish Uganda, Lake Albert \netc. \nBagrus docmak \nSouth American Corvina Corvina del Lago Venezuela/Costa Rica Cynoscions \nacoupa \nSouth American Purse Bagre Blanco (White \nCatfish) \nVenezuela/Costa Rica Pseudopimelodus sp. \n \n3. SUBJECT CRITERIA \n \nFifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Potential subjects must have: \n \n1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are \nconsumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and \nadults in generally good health.  Potential subjects must be at least three \nyears old and not older than 70 years.   \n  \n2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a \npan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract \nprovides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial \nfish extract AND\n positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: \n \n a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months \n previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters \n need to be reported in millimeters and be, as large or larger than the positive\n control histamine skin prick test. \n b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach \n since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of \n fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 \n 4 kU A/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual \n specific IgE score in kU A/L and the method used must be reported. \n \n  3. Certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of  \n   the skin test wheal and flare responses elicited by allergen extracts and   \n   histamine positive control. Conv entional antihistamines should be     \n   discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines  \n   should be discontinued for at least 7 da ys prior to skin testing.  Topical    \n   steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3     \n   weeks before skin testing (10,11).  Tr icyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin  \n   should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing (12) Topical local  \n   anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided at skin  \n   test sites (13). \n \n \nStatistical Design \nThe working hypothesis for this project is that the unique fish species used in the \nproduction of isinglass will be allergenic as documented by positive skin prick tests in \nindividuals with well documented allergies to more frequently consumed fish.  If this \nhypothesis is true, then all of the patients will display positive skin prick tests to the \nextracts of the various species of fish used in this study.  Since the subjects selected for \nthis study will have allergies to fish and these fish are known to contain parvalbumin as \ntheir major allergen, this finding will also provide proof that these unique fish species \ncontain parvalbumin that is cross-reactive with parvalbumin from the more commonly \ningested species.  If one or more of the unique fish species in this study contain no \nparvalbumin or low levels of parvalbumin, then some or all subjects may have negative \nskin prick test reactions to those extracts.  Similar determinations will be made for the \nswim bladder extracts from the unique fish species except that it is much less certain \nthat the swim bladders will contain sufficient allergen to provoke a positive skin prick \ntest reaction.  Statistically, we expect significantly higher numbers of positive skin prick \ntest reactions in the subjects to the various unique fish extracts than to the negative \ncontrol skin prick tests.   \n \n4.  BENEFITS AND RISKS  \n \nBenefits  \n \nThe direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not there is a potential for him or \nher to be allergic to these unique species of fish if ingested.  Results from all of the \nsubjects will be used to determine if the swim bladders contain parvalbumin and thus \nwhether isinglass used in processing of alcoholic beverages (beer, champagne, ale and \nwine) might be a risk for fish allergic individuals. \n 5  \n \n \nRisks \n \nSkin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in \nallergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (17-\n22. The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito \nbite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a \nfew minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. \n \nThe drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks \ncan occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may \nremain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally \nassociated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur \nat the site of the venipuncture.   \n \nThe subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the \nskin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin \nprick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin \nprick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered \naccording to the level and severity of reaction.  \n \n5.  RECRUITING PROCEDURES \n \nEach clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for his or her \nlocation.  Suggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, \nand recruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also \nbe sent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include \nexamples of letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human \nsubjects use committee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical \ninvestigator’s local human subjects use committee. \n \n6.  COMPENSATION \n \nA per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site \nshould propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, \nsupplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal \npreparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  \nCompensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when \nallowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  The compensation amount is to be determined by \nand paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per subject \ncost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  Instructions for \ninvoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are distributed to the clinical \ninvestigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without receipt of deliverables by \nFARRP. \n 6 \n7.  INFORMED CONSENT FORMS \n \nEach clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to \nconform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use \ncommittee.   \n \nObtaining Informed Consent \nThis procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each \nclinical investigator.   \n \n8.  MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY \n \nEach clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP Skin \nReactivity to Fish Study-Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Skin Reactivity to \nFish Study Data Sheet“ will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain \nsubject names, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to \nFARRP.  At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln the questionnaire and the data sheet will \nbe stored in a locked file in the Clinical Study Coordinators office.

Pepsin Digestion of Isinglass \n \nLead Scientists:   Stef J. Koppelman, Ph.D., AllerTeQ, Netherlands \n Sue L. Hefle, Ph.D., FARRP, University of Nebraska \n Steve L. Taylor, Ph.D., FARRP, University of Nebraska \n \nA. Introduction: \n \nIsinglass is prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the \nprimary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for \ncollagen preparations.  In the allergenicity assessment of novel proteins, pepsin digestion is one \nof the criteria used to evaluate their potential allergenicity (Taylor and Hefle, 2002).  Although \nisinglass is not a novel protein in human diets, its comparative resistance to pepsin digestion \nshould be a useful measure of its potential allergenicity.  If rapidly hydrolyzed by pepsin, less \nlikelihood exists that isinglass would sensitize susceptible individuals.  Sensitization to isinglass \nhas not been reported, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines \nfor many years.    This report describes the digestive stability of isinglass samples to pepsin in an \nidentical approach used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins \nconsidered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). \n \nB.  Materials and Methods: \n \nTest sample\n \nIsinglass (lot number 1839) was provided obtained from A. B. Vickers, Burton-upon-Trent, U.K. \nby FARPP.  The isinglass sample (received in dry state) was dissolved in distilled water at a \nconcentration of 5 mg/ml.  The isinglass solution remained slightly turbid.  Pre-incubation at \nlower pH (pH = 2) partially overcame this turbidity, but in order to make a fair comparison with \nother food proteins tested for digestibility, pre-incubation at low pH was not done.  Crude peanut \nextract (CPE) was prepared from ground peanut (Runner variety) as described previously \n(Koppelman et al., 2001).  \n \nPepsin\n \n \nPepsin was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), catalogue number P-6887.  This product \nwas chosen because it has the highest specific activity commercially available (3300 U/mg for \nthe particular batch), and because other researchers investigating the digestibility behavior of \npotentially allergenic proteins used this product as well (Thomas et al, 2004).  Pepsin was stored \nas a lyophilized powder, as supplied by the manufacturer, at – 20 C.  The ratio of 10 U of pepsin \nper ug of test protein was used throughout the study, according to Thomas et al. (2004).  Pepsin \nwas dissolved immediately before the digestion experiment and used within 15 minutes in order \nprevent possible loss of activity due to auto-digestion. \n \nDigestion assay conditions\n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 6 of 14 \n  \n \nTubes containing 1.52 ml of simulated gastric fluid (SGS) were prepared.  SGF was used at pH \n1.2 (0.063 N HCl, containing 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin) and pH 2.0 (0.01 N HCl, \ncontaining 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin).  In a control experiment the potential effect of \nadding protein (pepsin, test proteins) on the final pH was tested, and found to be negligible (less \nthan 0.05 pH points).   SGF was pre-warmed to 37 C for 5 minutes and 80 ul of 5 mg/ml \nisinglass was added at time point t = 0. For CPE, due to a lower solubility, SGF was prepared at \na higher concentration such that the addition of 400 ul of 1 mg/ml CPE resulted in the same final \nconcentration of HCl, NaCl, pepsin, and isinglass.  Samples of 200 ul were collected at time \npoints: 0.5 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10, min, 20 min, 30 min and 60 min.  Samples were immediately \nstopped by mixing with 70 ul of 200 mM NaHCO\n3 (pH = 11.0) and 70 ul of 5 times concentrated \nLaemmli electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli et al, 1970) containing 40% glycerol, 20% SDS, 5% \nb-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 M TRIS (pH 6.8) and 0.05% bromophenol blue.  The samples of 0.5 \nmin, 1 min, 2 min and 5 min were heated for 5 minutes at > 75 C directly after taking the sample \nof time point 5 min.  Samples of other time points were heated immediately after sampling.  All \nsamples were stored at – 20 C until analysis by SDS-PAGE.  \n \nThe sample of time point t = 0 min was prepared by stopping and heating SGF prior to the \naddition of test protein.  After adding the isinglass, the samples were heated again to ensure full \ndenaturation.  Pepsin auto-digestion was tested by adding 80 ul of water to SGF and incubation \nof 60 minutes as described for test proteins.  Protein stability at low pH was tested by preparing \nSGF without pepsin, and incubating the test protein for 60 minutes. \n \nSodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\n \n \nSDS-PAGE was performed generally according to Laemmli (Laemmli, et al. 1970) with the \nMiniProtean system (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA) using 10-20% precast gels or with manually \nprepared 15% homogenous gels.  The molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen \n(Carlsbad, CA. USA, Mark12 catalogue number LC5677, ranging from 2.5 to 200 kD) and were \nused according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 ul per sample was loaded and \nelectrophoresis was stopped just before the bromophenol blue-containing front reached the end \nof the gel.  \n \nTwo methods for gel staining were used. First, the novel Page-Blue method from Fermentas was \nused (Hanover, MD).  This method is said to be more sensitive compared to classical Coomassie \nstaining method.  Gels were destained overnight. For the analyses of the peanut protein digestion \n(performed earlier), the classical method was used: gels were stained in 1% Coomassie Brilliant \nBlue R-250 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 50% methanol/20% acetic acid over night. \nSubsequently, gels were washed with 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 5 minutes and destained \nwith 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 30 minutes.  After that, gels were further destained with \n25% methanol/10% acetic acid for 2 hours.  \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 7 of 14 \n  \nAll gels were scanned with a regular laboratory scanner, and scans were not optimized in any \nway in order to allow an objective comparison. \n \nC. Results: \n \nCharacterization of isinglass \n \nUndigested isinglass showed bands in the molecular weight range of 100-200 kD, but also three \nmore distinct bands at approximately 25 kD, 45 kD, and 100 kD, and one vague band between 6 \nand 14 kD (Figure 1).    \n \nDigestibility of isinglass at pH 1.2\n \nUpon incubation with pepsin at pH = 1.2, isinglass is digested rapidly.  The high molecular \nweight protein fraction was only visible at time points t = 0, 0.5 and 2 minutes. (Figure 2).  At \ntime point 0.5 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible.  After 2 \nminutes, no high molecular weight protein is observed.  At time points 0.5, 2, and 5 minutes, \nsome intermediate molecular weight protein/peptide smear (range: 30 to 60 kD) is observed, but \nonly vaguely.  This protein/peptide digestion product is completely further digested at later time \npoints.  \n \nDigestibility of isinglass at pH 2\n \nUpon incubation with pepsin at a somewhat higher pH of 2, isinglass is digested rapidly, but \nsome proteins/peptides remained for a longer time as compared to digestion at pH 1.2.  At time \npoints 0.5 and 2 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible (Figure 3).  \nThis band disappeared after 5 minutes, somewhat later compared to the incubation at pH = 1.2.  \nIn the time span from 0.5 to 30 minutes, some intermediate weight protein/peptides were visible, \nand these disappeared after 30 minutes.  \n \n \nIsinglass at both pH 1.2 and 2.0 appears to be labile in the absence of pepsin (Figure 2, 3). \nPepsin auto-digestion experiments at pH = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 show that the pepsin band in SDS-\nPAGE analysis is unaffected during the time course of the experiment (Figure 4), demonstrating \nthat observed bands in the intermediate and low molecular weight areas after incubation with \npepsin do not originate from pepsin. \n \nDigestibility of crude peanut extract - reference\n \nCrude peanut extract (CPE) (Figure 5) is characterized by a typical band pattern showing Ara h 1 \n(at approximately 63 kD as an intense, uniform band), Ara h 2 (a doublet at approximately 20 \nkD), Ara h 3 (a triplet at 42-45 kD, and bands at 25 kD, and 14 kD), and Ara h 6 (a single, less \nintense band at approximately 15 kD), shown in Figure 5, left lane, arrows indicate the identified \nallergens).  Incubation with pepsin at both  pH  = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 shows that the majority of \nAra h 1 disappears within 0.5 min, as well as the 42-45 kD bands of Ara h 3 (note that the \nremaining thick band at this height is pepsin).  In contrast, Ara h 2, in particular the heavy \nisoform remains stable for the time course of the experiment.  Ara h 6 also shows a high stability \nduring the experiment, probably even more stable than Ara h 2.  Other bands in CPE are difficult Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 8 of 14 \n  \nto assign, especially during the time course of the digestion experiment where a series of \npeptides are generated as a results of degradation of the higher molecular weight proteins (Ara h \n1 mainly).  \n \nD. Conclusions: \n \nIsinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, in a similar approach as used for assessing the \ndigestibility of several allergens and also proteins considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., \n2004).  Digestibility of peanut allergens was used as a reference. Compared to certain peanut \nallergens, isinglass is digested quickly.   \n  \nLimitations/speculation \n \nThe nature of the intermediate bands is not known.  They may represent isinglass-derived \npeptides, or other fish proteins. The vague band between 6 and 14 kD may possibly represent \nparvalbumin, with a molecular weight of 12.3 kD, but from this investigation, there are no \nexperimental data to support this.  However, all of the protein bands in isinglass are quickly \ndigested by pepsin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 9 of 14 \n  \n \nFigures:   \n \n \nFigure 1.1.

Evaluation of Commercial Anti-Frog and Anti-Carp Parvalbumin Monoclonal \nAntibodies for Use in ELISA for Detection of Parvalbumin in Isinglass  \n \nLead Scientists:   Lingyun Chen, Ph.D., University of Nebraska \n Richard E. Goodman, Ph.D., University of Nebraska \n  \nA. Introduction: \n \nCommercial monoclonal antibodies directed against frog and carp parvalbumin are available.  A \ncommercial monoclonal antibody directed against frog parvalbumin has been used in one study \nas a screening tool in selecting a cDNA library for mackerel parvalbumin, and also was \nsuccessfully used in the development of a mackerel parvalbumin ELISA (Hamada et al., 2003). \nFrog parvalbumin shares 43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species \n(according to a search of a database of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  \nCarp parvalbumin has a rather high degree of sequence homology with cod parvalbumin so the \nuse of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody might be even more promising for the detection of \npotentially allergenic fish parvalbumin.  Thus, an evaluation of the commercial anti-frog and \nanti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies was conducted for applicability/efficacy in \ndesigning an ELISA for the detection of residual parvalbumin in isinglass.  Simultaneously (and \nas described in FARRP-08-2006), polyclonal antisera were produced against purified codfish \nparvalbumin and used in the development of an ELISA for detection of residual parvalbumin in \nisinglass.  \n \nIsinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is \nprepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary \ncomponent of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for collagen \npreparations.  Fish collagen is not a major fish allergen but parvalbumin is widely considered as \nthe major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Although swim bladders are composed \nprimarily of collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., \n1989).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly \ninvestigated and certainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Sensitization to \nisinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-sensitized \nindividuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  This \nobservation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains \ninsufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. \n   \nThe anti-frog parvalbumin antibody was recently shown to detect parvalbumin found in the \nedible muscle tissues of cod, carp, catfish, and tilapia but not tuna (Chen et al., 2006).  The \nresults demonstrating the ability of the anti-frog parvalbumin monoclonal antibody to detect fish \nparvalbumins will be shared herein because sufficient cross-reactivity may exist to allow \ndetection of parvalbumin residues in commercial isinglass.  The anti-frog and anti-carp \nparvalbumin antibodies were evaluated for their ability to detect parvalbumin from various fish \nspecies in both ELISA and western blotting formats.

Antibodies: \n• Anti-frog parvalbumin Mab (PARV-19):  obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, \nMO.  \n• Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (Swant 235):  obtained from Swant (Bellinzona, \nSwitzerland). \n• Monoclonal anti-mouse IgG1 as negative control: obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. \n• Anti-mouse IgG -alkaline phosphatase conjugate: obtained from Pierce \nBiotechnolgoy, Inc. Rockford, IL \n2. Frozen carp, catfish, cod, tuna and tilapia fillet were purchased from local market in Lincoln, \nNE and isinglass samples were provided by A. B. Vickers of the U.K. All fish and isinglass \nsamples were stored at -20 °C prior to extraction.   \n3. Recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01) was provided by Dr. Ines Swoboda, Medical \nUniversity of Vienna, Austria.  \n \n C.  Methods: \n \nProtein extraction from fish tissue and isinglass \n \nFive grams of each fish sample were extracted with 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, \n0.01M, pH 7.4), with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 tablet of Complete® EDTA-free protease \ninhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).  Samples were blended in 50 mL of \nextraction buffer for 1 min using a Waring blender.  The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 x \ng for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant solution was collected and stored at -20 °C until analysis.  \nIsinglass samples were extracted by PBS at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) with continuous shaking \novernight at 4 °C.  The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 x g for 30 min at 4°C and the \nsupernatant was used as protein extract. \n \nProtein assay\n \nThe protein concentration of each extract was determined using a Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad \nLaboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using bovine serum \nalbumin (BSA) as a standard. \n \nSDS polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\n \nFish extracts were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), containing \n2- mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent, and heated at 95 °C for five min. Ten µL of each fish \nextract (containing 10 µg protein) was loaded onto a Novex® tris-glycine 10-20% ready gel \n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Five µL Precision Plus ProteinTM standards (Bio-Rad) were also \nused. Electrophoresis was carried out in a SureLockTM Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen).  \nFollowing electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Invitrolon PVDF membranes using an \nXcell II™ Blot Module (Invitrogen) for immunoblotting.  Transfer of proteins from the gel to \neach of the PVDF membranes was verified by staining the membranes with Ponceau S stain Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 7 of 21 \n  \n(Sigma-Aldrich).  Additional gels were stained with Brilliant Blue G colloidal concentrate \n(Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  Images of freshly destained gels \nwere captured and analyzed using a Kodak GL440 image station and 1D image analysis software \n(Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY).  \n \n2D electrophoresis\n  \nIsoelectric focusing was performed on 7 cm nonlinear pH 3-10 Zoom® strips in a Zoom® \nIPGRunner™ system (Invitrogen).  The strips were rehydrated for 1 hr at room temperature in a \nsolution consisting of 7 M urea, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1% pH 3-10 \nampholytes (Invitrogen) and 35 µg (for protein stain) or 3.5 µg (for immunoblotting)  fish protein \nextract.  Focusing conditions were controlled with a multi-step program: 200 V for 20 min, 450 \nV for 15 min, 750 V for 15 min and 2000 V for 30 min. After focusing and prior to the second \ndimension, strips were equilibrated in a mixture of one mL NuPage® reducing agent \n(Invitrogen) and 9 mL 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min, then alkylated \nby incubation with 125 mM iodoacetamide in 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for \n15 min.  The second dimension electrophoresis was conducted in a Novex® 4-20% Tris-Glycine \nZoom® Gel (Invitrogen).  Completed gels were used for immunoblotting and protein stain.  The \npI gradient of the Zoom® strips was calibrated by a low range pI isoelectric focusing calibration \nkit (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). \n \nImmunoblotting\n \nProteins separated in gels were transferred to PVDF membranes using an XCell II™ Blot \nModule (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  Following transfer, \nmembranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS (PBS-NFDM) for two hours at room \ntemperature and washed four times with PBS containing 0.5% v/v Tween 20 (PBS-T) with \nvigorous shaking.  The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-frog Mab \n(Parv-19) diluted 1:5,000 or anti-carp Mab (Swant 235) diluted 1:10,000 in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  \nAfter four washes in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for one hour with goat anti-mouse \nIgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), diluted \n1:5000 (v/v) in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  Membranes were washed four times with PBS-T and wetted \nin SuperSignal west Dura extended duration substrates (Pierce Biotechnology) to visualize the \nimmunocomplex. The chemiluminescent signal was captured by exposing Kodak® BioMax light \nfilms for various times (Eastman Kodak Company).   \n \nCompetitive ELISA\n \nA 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nagle Nunc international, Rochester, NY) was coated \nwith 20µg protein/ml carp extract (100µl/well) overnight at 4˚C.  After coating, the free binding \nsites of the plate were blocked by 350µl/well 0.1% porcine gelatin in PBS for 2 hr at room \ntemperature.  Serially diluted fish extracts, isinglass extracts, recombinant carp parvalbumin, \nPBS solution, or isinglass extracts spiked with a known amount of  recombinant carp \nparvalbumin were added to the blocked plate (50µl/well) as inhibitors followed by adding an \nequal volume of anti-carp Mab, diluted 1:15,000(v/v) in blocking buffer.  After incubation at \n37˚C for 1 hr, the plate was washed 4 times with PBS-T. Following washing, anti-mouse IgG -Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 8 of 21 \n  \nalkaline phosphatase conjugate, diluted 1:5000(v/v) in blocking buffer, was added to plate and \nincubated for 1 hr at 37˚C.  After washing, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and the \ncolor development was read at 410nm on a MRX microplate reader (Dynex technologies, \nChantlly, VA). \n \n D.  Results: \n \nElectrophoresis and immunoblots of fish protein extracts\n \n \n1D electrophoresis and western blot\n \nInitially, the protein profiles of cod, carp, catfish, tilapia, and tuna were assessed by SDS-PAGE, \nshown in Figure1.1A.  All five species showed similar protein banding patterns above a \nmolecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular \nweights among fish species.  Either one or two distinct bands of high concentration were \nobserved in the molecular weight range of 10-12 kDa expected for parvalbumins in carp (2), \ncatfish (2), cod (1), and tilapia (2).  No significant bands were noted in the tuna sample below 25 \nkDa.   \n \nImmunoblots obtained using the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab are shown in Figure 1.1B.  All \nvisible fish protein bands in the molecular weight range of 10-13 kDa were recognized by anti-\nfrog parvalbumin Mab.  The antibody did not bind to any bands in tuna (Figure 1.1B, lane 5).  \nThe molecular weight and relative abundance (determined by densitometry using the Kodak \nimage analysis software) of the antibody-binding fish proteins is summarized in Table 1.1.  Lane \n6 of Figure1.1B contains recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01) with a molecular weight \nof 11.4 kDa (Swoboda, 2002). \n \nImmunoblots using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab failed to provide clear profile of antibody \nbinding bands, which were masked by strong background.  In an effort to improve the \nbackground, several blocking reagents were tested in the immunoblotting, including non-fat dry \nmilk, bovine serum albumin and porcine gelatin.  However, no immunoblot of satisfactory \nquality was obtained that is comparable to those using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  More \noptimization work is needed to reveal the binding pattern of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to fish \nproteins on immunoblots.  \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 9 of 21 \n  \n \nFigure 1.1.

As with the previously evaluated 5 species and based on protein \nstaining with Coomassie blue, these 6 species showed similar protein banding patterns above a \nmolecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular \nweights among fish species.

Little non-specific binding of the two \nantibodies to other proteins was observed.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher \nsensitivity than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab since similar signal intensities were achieved within \nshorter exposure time when anti-carp Mab was used.  As noted with the earlier studies of 5 \nspecies, it should be noted that anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mab bind to parvalbumin \nfrom various fish species with different specificities.  Interestingly, the strongest binding \napparently obtained for anti-frog parvalbumin Mab was with the parvalbumins from redfish and \nflounder.  These same two parvalbumins showed very low apparent binding to anti-carp \nparvalbumin Mab.  Meanwhile, anti-carp parvalbumin Mab had high apparent specificity to \nparvalbumins from cod, cusk, hake and haddock, which exhibited weak apparent binding to anti-\nfrog parvalbumin Mab.  Both antibodies appear to bind well to pollock parvalbumin. \n \n \nFigure 1.2.

Three of the five \npolypeptides had a molecular weight of 10.6 kDa and the other two were of 11.6 kDa. Their pI \nvalues ranged from 3.5-4.25, based on protein markers in the low range pI (Amersham \nBiosciences), data not shown.  Catfish had two fairly strong antibody-binding proteins at pI 4.25 \nand a barely visible spot at pI 3.5.  Only one antibody-binding protein was observed in cod fish, \nwith a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and pI 3.6.  Anti-frog parvalbumin antibody recognized two \nbands in tilapia.  Even though these two proteins showed similar intensity in SDS-PAGE (Figure \n1.3 D1), their antibody-binding capacities were markedly different (Figure 1.3 D2). The 11.1 \nkDa protein with pI 3.6 exhibited much stronger binding than the 12.1 kDa subunit with pI 4.0.  \nThis suggested that the anti-frog pravlbumin Mab binds to different parvalbumin isoforms with \ndifferent specificity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 12 of 21 \n  \n \nFigure 1.3.

The inhibition curves of both carp and cod shifted to the left (the lower \nconcerntration end) when anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (solid lines in Figure 1.4) was used instead \nof anti-frog parvalbumin Mab (dot lines in Figure 1.4).  This suggested that less soluble fish \nprotein was needed to inhibit binding of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to solid-phased carp protein \nthan when anti-frog parvalbumin Mab is used.  As a result, the competitive ELISA using anti-\ncarp parvalbumin Mab has higher sensitivity in detecting fish parvalbumins than when anti-frog \nparvalbumin Mab is used.  It should be noted that the competitive ELISA was not conducted by \nusing more concentrated primary antibodies (1:5,000) than the optimized dilution (1:15,000) as \ndescribed in methods section. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.4. Inhibition curves generated by soluble carp and cod protein extracts in competitive \nELISA using anti-frog or anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (diluted 1:5,000) to bind to solid-phased \ncarp protein. \n \nA competitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was developed to detect parvalbumin in \nfish and fish derived products due to the superior sensitivity of the anti-carp Mab compared to \nthat of the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Using the amount of recombinant carp parvalbumin \nneeded to obtain 20% inhibition as a detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of detecting \n0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin in a PBS extract (or 1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis). \n \nThe competitive ELISA is developed to test fish parvalbumin in fish and fish derived products.  \nSince the complex biochemical constituents in the extract of a matrix such as isinglass or fish \ngelatin might interfere with the assay, we wanted to evaluate the possibility that a high collagen Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 14 of 21 \n  \ncontent matrix might alter assay results.  Therefore, inhibition curves were obtained by serially \ndiluting recombinant carp parvalbumin in PBS (no matrix effect) or in 10% (w/v) fish gelatin \nextract (Norland Products, Inc.), simulating fish protein matrix effects (Figure 1.5).  The fish \ncollagen extract may contain an unknown amount of fish parvalbumin.  The results showed a \ndramatic difference in the slopes of the two inhibition curves, which suggested the standard \ncurve generated in a PBS solution of recombinant carp parvalbumin was not suitable to evaluate \nparvalbumin content in the fish gelatin extract. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.5. Competitive ELISA detecting recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp c1.01) in PBS or \nfish collagen protein extract. \n \nIt is possible to overcome the problem of matrix effect by spiking a known amount of \nrecombinant carp parvalbumin into the sample protein extract and testing both spiked and \nunspiked samples in the same assay.  At least theoretically both spiked and non-spiked samples \nexperience similar matrix effects and should exhibit parallel inhibition curves.  Figure 1.6 shows \nan example of competitive ELISA carried out on an isinglass sample.  In this case the sample \nwas spiked with 20 µg recombinant carp parvalbumin per g sample and analyzed simulateously \nwith an equivalent unspiked sample.  Based on the inhibition curves, a dilution representing 0.28 \nmg dry weight of spiked sample and a dilution representing 1.57 mg of unspiked sample both \nexhibited 50% inhibition (contain equivalent amounts of parvalbumin).  Assuming the \nparvalbumin content in non-spiked sample is X µg/g, the amount of parvalbumin in both non-\nspiked and spiked sample is \n1.57mg*X µg/g=0.28 mg *(X µg/g +20 µg/g) \n \nSolving the equation,  \nX=4.3 µg/g Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 15 of 21 \n  \nThus this specific sample of isinglass contains 4.3 ppm parvalbumin.  This example \ndemonstrates that this assay can be used to measure the equivalent content of parvalbumin in \nisinglass samples or those of other similar matrices. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.6. Competitive ELISA detection of parvalbumin content in a fish collagen sample using \nrecombinant carp parvalbumin as internal standard. \n \nAnalysis of Parvalbumin Content of Fish Tissues by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp \nParvalbumin Mab \n \nCompetitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was performed under optimized \nconditions to detect parvalbumins in various fish protein extracts and the results were showed in \nFigure 1.7.  Protein concentration of fish extracts that achieved 50% inhibition are calculated as \n1.8, 0.4, 2.8, 0.7 and 10 µg/mL for carp, catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna respectively, which is \nequivalent to 0.1  µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin.  If recombinant carp parvalbumin \nneeded for 20% inhibition is defined as detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of \ndetecting parvalbumin content equivalent to as low as 0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin. \n \nThe inhibition curves of most fish extracts except catfish and cod exhibited similar slopes to that \nof recombinant carp parvalbumin.   It is not known if the slopes of catfish and cod were \nsignificant different from the others.  The slope differences can be explained by the existence of \ndiffering specificities for the antibody binding to the epitopes of catfish or cod parvalbumin. \nNevertheless, the matrix effect of fish extracts may also introduce slope variation.   \n \nCarp extract containing 1.8 µg/mL total proteins exhibited inhibition equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL \nrecombinant carp parvalbumin.  That is, the abundance of parvalbumin in carp extract is \n0.1/1.8=5.5%.  Similarly, parvalbumin abundances of catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna in protein Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 16 of 21 \n  \nextracts were estimated at 25, 3.6, 14.3 and 1% respectively.  These numbers are different from \nthe abundance results calculated by SDS-PAGE densitometry shown in Table 1.1, which \nsuggested the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab binds to fish parvalbumin from various fish species \nwith different specificity.   It is interesting to observe detectable parvalbumin in tuna extract that \nis not visible in either SDS-PAGE or westernblot using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Anti-carp \nparvalbumin Mab may have higher specificity for tuna parvalbumin than anti-frog antibody. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.7. Inhibition curves generated by carp, catfish, cod, tilapia, tuna fish protein extracts \nand recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp c1.01) in competitive ELISA using anti-carp \nparvalbumin Mab.\n \n \nAnalysis of Parvalbumin Content of Isinglass by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp \nParvalbumin Mab \n \nThe competitive ELISA method described above using anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal \nantibody was used to assess the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Initially,  nine samples of \nisinglass produced from the maws of seven different species of fish were analyzed as shown in \nTable 1.2.  These isinglass samples were manufactured in typical fashion with milling but no \nfurther processing steps; thus these would be considered as unprocessed fish maws.  A low, but \nvariable, level of residual parvalbumin was found in isinglass from all of the fish species.  Based \non the comparatively higher level of residual parvalbumin found in the isinglass manufactured \nfrom the Nile perch maws, this species of fish was eliminated as a source of maws for the \nproduction of isinglass.   \n \nSince parvalbumin is a water-soluble protein that binds calcium, washing was introduced as a \ncommercial unit operation in an attempt to decrease residual parvalbumin levels.  Normally, \nunprocessed maws would be washed with water.

Based on limited experiments, the determination was made that the \nphosphate buffer wash was perhaps the most effective in reducing parvalbumin levels.  \nSomewhat variable results were obtained for isinglass produced from maws of various fish \nspecies but the phosphate buffer wash appeared to be effective.  This experiment was not \nrepeated.  The sources of the fish swim bladders used to produce these samples of isinglass are \nrepresentative of the range of species used in the commercial production of isinglass. \n \nTable 1.4 shows the parvalbumin content of some commercial isinglass samples provided by the \nisinglass manufacturers.  These samples were selected after the elimination of Nile perch as a \ncommercial source of maws and after development of the phosphate buffer washing operation.  \nThe sample codes can be matched to the descriptions provided in Table 1.3.  It should be noted \nthat, for some unknown reason, the results of this batch of assay were apparently lower than \nwhat we tested previously.  The reference isinglass sample was tested on this occasion as usual \nand it yielded a result of 1.8 µg/g, much less than previous results (4.6-5.0 µg/g); the earlier, \nhigher level was confirmed on numerous occasions.  Some potential assay problems, such as \npoor protein extraction, degradation of coating protein or anti-parvalbumin antibody, have been \nexcluded as possible causes of the lower than expected results.   \n \nTable 1.4 \nParvalbumin Content of Isinglass Samples as Determined  \nby the Anti-Carp Parvalbumin Mab ELISA \n \nIsinglass Sample Parvalbumin content (µg/g) \nFA 1+2/05 2.2 \nFL 17-18/03 nd \nJ52 1.1 \nFL13/04 nd \nFA13/05 0.8 \nFL21/05 1.4 \nReference sample 1.8 \nClinical challenge \nmaterial 1.0 \n  * nd: not detectable, <0.2 µg/g \n   \nTable 1.4 also provides the analysis of the residual parvalbumin level in the clinical challenge \nmaterial that is currently being used to assess whether isinglass has the potential to elicit allergic \nreactions in fish-allergic individuals.

Discussion:   \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 19 of 21 \n  \nParvalbumins share considerable sequence homology among fishes.  Frog parvalbumin shares \n43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species (according to a search of a \ndatabase of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  Anti-frog and anti-carp \nparvalbumin monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding to the parvalbumins in fish muscle \ntissues from several divergent fish species (Chen et al., 2006).  We were unable to obtain fish \nmuscle tissues from the species of fish used to manufacture isinglass but these results suggest \nthat parvalbumin is present in the muscle tissues of most, if not all, fish species.  Of course, \nswim bladders rather than muscle tissues are used as the raw material for preparation of \nisinglass.  However, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).   \n \nWhile anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mabs detect the presence of parvalbumin in muscle \ntissues from the muscle tissues of all fish species tested in this study, parvalbumin from various \nfish species show differences in specificity to each of these antibodies.  Anti-frog parvalbumin \nMab appears to be most useful for detecting parvalbumin from flounder, pollock and redfish \ncompared to the other species tested.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher specifity for \ncarp, cod, cusk, hake, haddock and pollock parvalbumins than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab, \nhowever, it displayed much weaker binding to parvalbumins from flounder and redfish.  In 2-\ndimensional electrophoresis with immunoblotting only, the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was able \nto detect parvalbumin from tuna.   \n \nThese electrophoresis and immunoblotting results demonstrate convincingly that commercial \nanti-parvalbumin antibodies are able to detect the presence of parvalbumin in a range of fish \nspecies.  Certainly, the quantitative reliability of an ELISA based upon either of these antibodies \nmay be dependent upon the species origin of the fish-based ingredient that is being evaluated.  \nHowever, even though isinglass is made from species of fish that were not evaluated here, a \nsufficient number of species were evaluated to indicate that these antibodies should have some \nutility in the detection of parvalbumin residues in isinglass. \n \nThe anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was employed for the development of a parvalbumin ELISA.  \nBecause sequence homology was greater between other fish parvalbumin and carp parvalbumin \ncompared to frog parvalbumin, the choice of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was considered as \nadvantageous.  The inhibition curves presented in Figure 1.4 also indicate that the anti-carp \nparvalbumin MAb was the superior choice.  While a successful ELISA method was developed, \nits quantitative accuracy for detecting residual parvalbumin from species other than carp is \nundoubtedly compromised to some degree by the variability in binding specificity discussed \nabove.     \n \nResidual parvalbumin was detected in samples of commercial isinglass using the competitive \nELISA method with anti-carp parvalbumin Mab.  Obviously, some caution is warranted in the \ninterpretation of these results because of the previously discussed differences in binding \nspecificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab with parvalbumins from the various fish species.  \nThe anti-carp parvalbumin Mab is reasonably good at detecting parvalbumins from cod, cusk, \nhake, pollock, haddock, carp, catfish, and tilapia based upon the binding specificity.  This Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 20 of 21 \n  \ndemonstrates that this antibody has reasonably broad specificity.  The rather low level of \nsensitivity (1 µg/g or 1 ppm) of the ELISA also suggests that the method would detect \nparvalbumin residues in spite of the differences in binding specificities.  However, since this \nELISA has not been applied to samples of the fish used in the manufacture of isinglass, we \ncannot categorically indicate that it would detect parvalbumin from those species.  Furthermore, \nthe quantitative accuracy of this method cannot easily be substantiated.  However, its value in \ncomparative analysis of the effectiveness of various approaches to the possible reduction of \nresidual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass would seem to be quite excellent. \n \nSince the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish contains parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), a \nreasonable assumption would be that the swim bladders of the fish used in the manufacture of \nisinglass would also contain parvalbumin.  The nature of the collagen matrix and the known \neffectiveness of isinglass in removal of protein haze components of beers and ales suggest that \nisinglass might well bind parvalbumin.  The discovery of residual parvalbumin in isinglass \nindicates that this is the case.  Since parvalbumin is water-soluble, the expectation would be that \nthe parvalbumin could be removed from isinglass by incorporation of washing steps in the \nmanufacturing process.  In fact, washing with phosphate buffer is apparently effective in \nreduction of residual parvalbumin levels.  However, parvalbumin cannot be entirely eliminated \nfrom isinglass by washing.  Although this ELISA seems to provide reasonable proof that residual \nparvalbumin is present at rather low levels in isinglass, development of an ELISA based upon \nanti-cod parvalbumin was also pursued. \n \nThe levels of residual isinglass found in commercial isinglass using the anti-carp parvalbumin \nmonoclonal Ab ELISA are very low (1-5 ppm).  Since isinglass is very insoluble and used as a \nclarifying agent for beers and ales, the majority of any isinglass added to these beverages would \nbe removed by precipitation, filtration, centrifugation or other means.  In all likelihood, much of \nthe residual isinglass would also likely be removed.  Clearly, addition of isinglass to these \nbeverages could result in the incorporation of extremely low levels of parvalbumin into these \nbeverages.  Clinical challenges trials on the allergenicity of isinglass are needed to determine if \nthe low levels of parvalbumin present in isinglass represent any risk whatsoever to fish-allergic \nindividuals. \n \n \nReferences: \n \nChen L, Hefle S L, Taylor S L, Swoboda I, Goodman R E.  2006.

The procedure is briefly outlined as following: \n1. The microplates were coated with 20 μg/mL carp protein extract (100 μL/well) \novernight at 4ºC; \n2.

Based on the inhibition curve, 0.025 mL unspiked \nextract (the second point from right end of the unspiked curve) and 0.0025 mL spiked \nextract exhibited similar inhibition.  Therefore, 0.025 mL unspiked extract and 0.0025 \nmL spiked extract contained equal amount of parvalbumin.   \n \nX*0.025=(X+1.1)*0.0025 X=0.12 ug (rCyp C1.01 equivalence)/mL (beer sediment extract)  \n \n \nInhibition ELISA detecting fish parvalubmin in sediment of\nbeer tank\n-4.0 -3.5 -3.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nUnspiked\nSpiked\nLog Inhibitor (beer tank sediment  extract), mL/well\nOptical density at 410nm\n \n \nFigure 1.

Introduction \n \nAll codfish-allergic individuals are reported to have IgE antibodies specific to Gad c 1, a \nparvalbumin, the first purified and characterized fish allergen (Elsayed and Bennich, 1975; \nTaylor et al., 2004). Parvalbumins are a group of highly related calcium binding proteins that are \napparently important in regulating calcium flux in vertebrates.  Parvalbumins have also been \nidentified as the major allergens in other fish species including salmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel \n(Tra j 1), bigeye tuna (Thu o 1), carp (Cyp c 1) and several species of mackerels (Sco j 1, Sco a \n1, and Sco s 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 2000; Van Do et al., 1999; Shiomi et al., 1998; \nShiomi et al., 1999; Hamada et al., 2003).  Thus, parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen in \nfish (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 1997).  Parvalbumin is \nalso the major allergen of frog and the sequence of frog parvalbumin has been determined \n(Hilger et al., 2002; cross-reactivity exists between fish and frog parvalbumins (Hilger et al., \n2004).  Based on these studies it is clear that most vertebrates have at least two genes that encode \nhighly identical forms of parvalbumin, that are classified primarily by pI values as alpha-\nparvalbumins (pI ~ 5.0 or greater) and beta-parvalbumins (pI ~ 4.5 or less), and with sequences \nthat align more closely within the two lineages (Swoboda et al., 2002).  However, it is not clear \nthat definition based on pI value alone is meaningful.  Although mammals also have \nparvalbumins, they have not been reported as allergens.  While many of the parvalbumin \nsequences that have been reported as allergens appear to be of the beta-lineage by sequence \nalignment it is important to recognize that various fish species have between two and five \nparvalbumin proteins (Pechere et al., 1971; Giriga and Rehbein, 1988; Chen et al., 2006).   \nBecause we were interested in detecting the major allergenic protein from a variety of fish \nspecies it is important to evaluate species and isoform differences of the parvalbumins.  \nTherefore we performed bioinformatics analyses to compare available sequences from \ncommonly consumed fish parvalbumins in order to understand the structural and sequential \nsimilarity of these proteins.  This analysis will assist in the evaluation of the use of various \nantibodies such as anti-frog parvalbumin, anti-carp parvalbumin, and anti-cod parvalbumin in \nthe detection of parvalbumins from a range of fish species. \n \n \nB. Methods \n \nParvalbumin sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information \n(www.ncbi.nih.gov).  A clustal W alignment was performed using DNASTAR with \nrepresentative parvalbumins from a number of important species of fish: carp, cod, mackerel, \nperch, pike, pollack, salmon, silver hake, whiting and toadfish swimbladder.  If two or more Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 6 of 12 \n  \nsequences were available for a given species, the most divergent were compared.  Results are \npresented as multiple sequence alignment, a percent identity and sequence divergence table and a \nphylogenetic tree (Figures 2.1-2.3).  In addition, a multiple sequence alignment to carp \nparvalbumin sequence GI# 17977825 was performed (Fig. 2.4) with another carp, three cod, one \ncatfish, two frog parvalbumins and those of rat and bovine using the Align program (Scientific \nand Educational Software, Cary, NC), which uses a PAM250 scoring matrix with a mismatch \npenalty of 2, gap penalty of 4 and gap extension penalty of 1 (Chen et al., 2006).  The pI value \nfor each sequence was calculated using Protean protein structure prediction and annotation \nsoftware (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).     \n \nC. Results & Discussion \n \nThe results are summarized graphically in Figures 2.1-2.4. \n \nNote that the sequences around the two calcium binding pockets are the most conserved, as \nexpected (Fig. 2.1).  It is not clear whether IgE from most individuals with allergy to fish \nparvalbumin bind at the Ca+ binding region, though there are data that indicate the removal of \ncalcium reduces IgE binding for at least some allergic subjects (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998; \nSwoboda et al., 2002).  As aligned here, parvalbumin from the other fish are between 56 and \n91% identical to those of the three cod fish parvalbumin species (Fig. 2.2), which are themselves \nonly 63 to 74% identical.  These high levels of sequence identity indicate a high likelihood of \nIgE cross-reactivity for at least some allergic subjects (Aalberse, 2000).  The studies by \nBugajska-Schretter et al. (1998) and Swoboda et al. (2002) have also provided evidence that \nmany individuals bind to parvalbumin from a number of these species including: carp, cod, eel, \nperch, salmon and tuna.  Cross-species inhibition has also demonstrated that pre-incubating sera \nof a number of fish allergic individuals with an extract of codfish significantly diminished or \nabolished IgE binding to carp, eel, perch, salmon and tuna demonstrating shared IgE binding \n(Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998).   \n \nThe parvalbumin family of calcium binding proteins has diverged through evolutionary history, \nbut the overall structure and the sequences are remarkably conserved across broad taxonomic \ngroups.  An interesting finding is that many fish species have two or more “types” of \nparvalbumins that either represent, alpha- and beta-parvalbumins or functionally different beta-\nisoforms that appear to be more conserved across species than across types, within a given taxa \n(Fig. 2.3).  For instance, one parvalbumin from salmon aligns better with pike than it does to the \nother salmon parvalbumin, which is closer to a parvalbumin from pollack.  However, these fish \nproteins are all more similar to each other than to the mammalian and amphibian alpha-\nparvalbumins that are known and appear to be less allergenic (or alternatively more tolerogenic \nthan the fish parvalbumins.  The biological significance of the two types of parvalumins is not \nunderstood (Swoboda et al., 2002).    \n \nTogether this information demonstrating the close sequence similarity across species of fish \nsuggests that one or two parvalbumins may function well as diagnostic reagents (skin test Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 7 of 12 \n  \nreagents or IgE binding targets) for most individuals with fish allergy.  Conversely, antibodies to \none or two of these fish parvalbumins could serve as reagents for detection of muscle tissue from \na wide range of fish species. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.1.

Purification of Codfish Parvalbumin \n \n Lead Scientist:  Aard de Jong., Ph.D., TNO, The Netherlands \n \nA. Introduction: \n \nSince isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major allergen from \nfish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around the possible \npresence of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major allergen in several different \nspecies of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and tuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; \nBugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et \nal., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; \nShiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999 ) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals \nwith fish allergy (Taylor et al., 2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the fish species \nused in the manufacturing of isinglass have not been examined.  However, because parvalbumin \nis present at some level in the majority of fish that have been investigated (Chen et al., 2006; \nTaylor et al., 2004), the assumption that parvalbumin is present in the fish species used to \nmanufacture isinglass seems reasonable.  Furthermore, although parvalbumin is primarily found \nin fish muscle while isinglass is manufactured from swim bladders, parvalbumin has been \nidentified in the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish (Gerday et al., 1989).  Again, it seems \nprudent to assume that the swim bladders of the fish species used to manufacture isinglass also \ncontain parvalbumin.  Thus, the detection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass \nseems to be a key factor in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material.  Because \ncod parvalbumin is the best characterized of the fish allergens, the development of an ELISA for \nparvalbumin was pursued with the hypothesis that this ELISA would also detect any residual \nparvalbumin in isinglass emanating from the swim bladders used in its manufacture. \n \nThe development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA required several steps.  This first step was the \npurification of cod parvalbumin.  This portion of the research effort was sub-contracted to TNO \nin the Netherlands to a group headed by Aard de Jong., Ph.D.  This group succeeded in the \npurification of gram amounts of cod parvalbumin.  Their report can be found as Appendix A. \n \nII.  Production of Anti-Cod Parvalbumin Polyclonal Antibodies \n \n Lead Scientist:  Sue L. Hefle, Ph.D., FARRP, University of Nebraska \n \nA. Introduction: \n \nOnce purified cod parvalbumin was obtained (see Section IV), the production of antibodies was \nneeded as the next step in the development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA.  The approach involved \nthe production of polyclonal antibodies against cod parvalbumin in rabbits.  While the earlier \nELISA efforts had involved use of commercial monoclonal antibodies against frog and carp \nparvalbumins (see FARRP-07-2006), the production of polyclonal antisera was selected in hopes \nthat the specificity of the antibodies would be broader allowing more consistent detection of Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 6 of 28 \n  \nparvalbumins from various fish species and the swim bladders of the species used to produce \nisinglass. \n \n \n B.  Materials & Methods: \n \nPurified cod parvalbumin was obtained from TNO Food Research Institute (Zeist, the \nNetherlands, see Section I and Appendix A).  Antibodies were produced at Covance \nLaboratories (Denver, PA, USA).  Three New Zealand female rabbits were injected with the \npurified cod parvalbumin using a standard immunization protocol (Harlow and Lane, 1988) and \nTiterMax adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).  Initial injections were 200 µg \nparvalbumin per rabbit intradermally, and booster injections were 100 µg subcutaneously every \nfour weeks.  Blood serum was collected every three weeks and tested for response using a non-\ncompetitive ELISA.  As of the second booster injection, titers (defined as the log reciprocal of \nthe mid-linear portion of the titration curve) reached more than 10,000 in all rabbits.  A pool of \ntwo production bleeds from each rabbit (pool titer 100,000) was sent to Drs. Stef Koppelman \n(AllerTeQ) and Martin Hessing (Podiceps) for use in developing ELISAs for the detection of \nparvalbumin. \n \n C.  Results & Discussion:  \n \nHigh-titer polyclonal antisera against cod parvalbumin was obtained from the immunized \nrabbits.  This antisera was used to develop the cod parvalbumin ELISA (see Section III). \n \n D.  References: \n \nHarlow E, Lane D. 1988. Antibodies: a laboratory manual.

Introduction: \n \nAlthough it is widely recognized that parvalbumin is a pan-allergen from fish muscle tissues and \nthe major allergen for fish-allergic individuals, no documentation exists to demonstrate the \npresence of parvalbumin in either fish flesh or fish maws from the species of fish used to \nmanufacture isinglass.  This report describes the procurement of fish and fish maws from these \nspecies of fish and the preparation of extracts from those samples.  In the following phase of the \ninvestigations, an ELISA for the detection of cod parvalbumin was developed and used to assess Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 7 of 28 \n  \nthe parvalbumin content of these extracts.  In this section of the report, the extracts were \nanalyzed for protein concentration and SDS-PAGE band pattern.  The extraction studies resulted \nin the selection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the preparation of the extracts on a larger \nscale.  \n \n \n B.  Materials & Methods: \n \nFish samples\n \nWhole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers \nused by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 \nwhole fish).  The fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-like \ntissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was discarded.  In \nthis report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1) and the description \nmaw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.  \n \n \nTable 3.1 Description of Fish and Fish Maw Samples \n \nSpecies code Description Species \nJ 52/04 Corvina from S.

The processing background of these samples was \nunknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and \ncovered with mold.  Samples of maw and fish (after fillets were prepared) were stored until use \nat -20° C. \n \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 8 of 28 \n  \nExtraction buffers \nWater, PBS and 0.9% salt solution were used to prepare extracts.  Although water and 0.9% salt \nsolution are not buffers, the set of these extraction fluids are referred to as extraction buffers \n(water, PBS, 0.9% NaCl).  All three extraction buffers were sterile and pyrogen free solutions. \nPBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue number N400500) and contained per \nliter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na\n2HPO4·2H2Oand , 0.3 g NaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  Water and 0.9% \nNaCl were from Fresenius Kabi as well (catalogue numbers B230667 and 2660091, \nrespectively).  Containers with extraction buffer were only used once after opening.  \n \nProtein concentration determination\n \nBradford analysis was used, applying Bradford reagent from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, \ncatalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Sigma: A7906, \nminimum BSA content: 98%) \n \nSDS-PAGE \n \nSDS-PAGE was performed with a ready-to-use electrophoresis system equipped with 4-20% \ngradient gels (precast, Mercury PerfectPAGE SDS, catalogue number 5300.41212, Continental \nLab Products, San Diego, CA, USA) under standard conditions.  Markers were from BioRad \n(Hercules, CA, USA, product name: Precision Plus Protein Standards). Laemmli sample buffer \nwas from Biorad (catalogue number 161.0737) and 1:20 (V:V) β-mercaptoethanol (MP \nBiomedicals Inc., Uden, the Netherlands, catalogue number 194834) was added prior to use.  \nGels were stained with Coomassie Briljant Blue (Acros Organics, Landsmeer, the Netherlands, \ncatalogue number 191490250, 0.1% in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol), and destained with \n10% acetic acid and 40% methanol.  Gels were scanned with a HP Photosmart 3110 scanner, \nusing HP Solution Center software. \n  \nA reference sample of purified parvalbumin obtained from FARRP and its preparation has been \ndescribed in Section I of this report. \n \nGeneral extraction procedure\n \nFish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a \nprofessional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-\nmix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared \nby stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of extraction buffer for 2 hours at \nroom temperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml \nPP-test tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  \nFor exploratory extracts, supernatants were taken and analyzed directely.  Production extracts \nwere filtered over 0.22 µm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES (polyethersulfone) \nsterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic (Corning Inc., Acton, MA, USA). \nAfter filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml polypropylene cryo vials, \n12,5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner bio-one catalogue number \n121263).  Filtration and subdividing was done in a flow chamber. \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 9 of 28 \n  \n \n C.

Molecular weights of markers are \nindicated next the marker lanes (kDa). \n \n \nAll fish flesh samples (Figure 3.1), except F 21/05 show a band pattern very similar to each other \nand very similar to that of cod fish, (sample from a local supermarket).  A triplet between \napproximately 37 and 50 kDa is clearly visible, as well as bands at approximately 60 and 100 \nkDa.  A faint triplet at approximately 30 kDa is visible in all samples (except for F 21/05) as \nwell.  Also, a band at approximately 12 kDa is clearly visible in all fish samples, including F \n21/05.  This band is most likely parvalbumin (based on MW and band assignment described in \nthe relevant literature.  The staining of the gel depicted in Figure 3.1A is less clear, for unknown \nreason, and the parvalbumin is therefore less clearly visible.  The control sample of cod fish on \nthis gel shows the same phenomenon, indicating the that this is indeed a gel (staining) artifact, \nrather than a difference in band pattern as compared to the other fish samples investigated \n(Figures 1B and 1C).  It should be noted that the fish sample F 21/05 arrived in a non-frozen \ncondition at PodiCeps premises, covered with mold.  Although the fish flesh was prepared as \nbest as possible under these conditions, the different SDS-PAGE pattern may well be explained \nby this.  \n \nWater, PBS, and 0.9% NaCl gave similar results for extracts of fish flesh (similar band pattern, \nsimilar band intensity).  Extracts prepared with SDS-PAGE sample buffer showed more intense \nbands.  \n \n1 Markers  \n2 Codfish (control) \n3 - \n4 FA 1/2/05 (Sample buffer)  \n5 FA 1/2/05 (Water) \n6 FA 1/2/05 (PBS) \n7 FA 1/2/05 (0.9% NaCl) \n8 - \n9 FA 13/05 (Sample buffer)  \n10 FA 13/05 (Water) \n11 FA 13/05 (PBS) \n12 FA 13/05 (0.9% NaCl) \n        1      2     3        4     5      6     7      8     9    10    11   12 \n15 \n25 \n100 \n10 \n20 \n37 \n50 \n75 \n150 \n250 Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 13 of 28 \n  \nFor maws, quite another picture emerges.  As shown in Figure 2 (panels A, B, and C), all \nsamples of maws have a band pattern different to that of cod flesh which was used as a control.  \nA set of bands at approximately 150 kDa, and a (sometimes) vague band at around 50 kDa is \npresent in all maw samples.  There are some individual differences as well.  For example, \nsamples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 show protein bands at approximately 20 kDa.  \n \nA noteworthy difference occurred in maw extracts prepared with salt versus without salt.  The \noverall intensity of proteins bands was higher for all maw samples (except for FL 17/18/05) in \nextracts prepared with physiological salt concentration.  More specifically, the protein band at \napproximately 150 kDa was not present or was barely visible in extracts prepared without salt. \nThere are some additional differences between extracts with or without salt, varying for each \nspecies.  When SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used for extraction, the overall intensity of \nstaining was much higher.  Furthermore, an additional band at approximately 20 kDa was found \nin all samples.  Sample J52/04 had the lowest intensity of this band.  It is unlikely that this band \nis parvalbumin for two reasons.  First, the molecular weight is different.  Second, parvalbumin is \nwater/salt extractable by definition.  It cannot be excluded, though, that parvalbumin is present in \nthe maw extracts based on this SDS-PAGE analysis even though no noteworthy bands were \nvisible in the 12kDa region. \n \nQualitative analysis (Bradford)\n \nThe protein concentration of all fish flesh and fish maw extracts was determined using Bradford \nanalysis (Table 3.2). \n \nTable 3.2.

For the other samples,  the protein concentration ranges from approximately 2.2 to 4.4 \nmg/ml. More noteworthy differences in protein concentrations were found for extracts made \nfrom the flesh of the different fish species.  \n \nFor fish maw extracts, lower protein concentrations were found.  Differences in protein \nconcentration were found in comparisons between the different extraction buffers.  Differences \nwere also noted in the protein concentrations prepared from maws of different species.  In fact, \nextracts prepared in the absence of physiological concentrations of salt show a much lower \nprotein concentration as compared to extracts prepared with salt.  These data are in line with the \nresults of the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2A, B, and C).  \n \nSelection of extraction buffer\n \nThe choice of extraction buffer (water, 0.9% NaCl, and PBS) had little effect on the protein band \npattern encountered with SDS-PAGE and the protein yield as determined by the Bradford assay \nfor fish flesh.  However, for the maw extracts, a substantially higher yield and a richer band \npattern was obtained when extracts were prepared in the presence of physiological \nconcentrations of salt.  \n \nSDS-PAGE sample buffer was used to prepare extracts as controls.  Due to the presence of the \ndetergent SDS and the reducing agent DTT, protein extraction becomes more efficient, resulting \nin higher yields and additional proteins that get solubilized.  However, the nature of this buffer \nmakes it not suitable for the skin testing aspects of this investigation (results not yet available). \n \nThe decision was made to select PBS as the extraction buffer and to exclude fish sample F 21/05 \nfrom production of skin test extracts.  The production of skin test extracts will be described later \nin conjuction with the results of the skin test trials. \n \nThe extracts described in this section of the report were subsequently used with the cod \nparvalbumin ELISA to assess the parvalbumin content of the fish flesh and maw samples used in \nthe manufacturing of isinglass (see Section V below). \n \nIV.

Materials and Methods: \n \nSDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by electroblotting according \nto the method of Towbin et al. (1979). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with \naffinity purified anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies. Bound anti-cod parvalbumin IgG was detected \nwith peroxidase-labelled goat-anti-rabbit-IgG antibodies using the DAB staining method.  \n  \n C.  Results & Discussion: \nThe Westen blot indicates that all fish muscle extracts reacted with affinity-purified antibodies \nagainst cod parvalbumin, with some differences in reactivity (Figure 4, upper panel).  Maws \nwere analyzed as well (Figure 4, lower panel).  In maws, the parvalbumin was only vaguely \nvisible for F21/05 and other extracts did not show any reacting parvalbumin.  While parvalbumin \nseems present in fish muscle on the basis of Western blots, parvalbumin was not detected using \nthe same antibodies in the ELISA (see following section).  This may be explained by the fact that \nepitopes are under native condition in the ELISA and not as readily accessible to the anti-\nparvalbumin antibodies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 16 of 28 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.1 Western blot of purified parvalbumin and individual fish extracts (indicated right), \ndeveloped with affinity-purified anti-parvalbumin. \nUpper panel: fish extracts, lower panel: maw extracts. \n \n \nFish \n1= Markers (kDa), indicated left \n2= Parvalbumin \n3= empty \n4= FL 17/18/05 \n5= empty \n6= FA 13/05 \n7= FA 1/2/05 \n8= empty \n9= FL13/04 \n10= empty \n11= J52/04 \n12= empty \n50 \n75 \n100 \n250 \n           1     2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11 12 \n \nMaws \n1= Parvalbumin \n2= Markers (kDa), indicated left \n3= empty \n4= FL17/18/05 \n5= FA 13/05 \n6= empty \n7= FA 1/2/05 \n8= empty \n9= FL13/04 \n10= empty \n11= J52/04 \n12= F21/05 \n25 \n37 \n150 \n100 \n75 \n50 Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 17 of 28 \n  \n \nD.

Introduction: \n \nWith the production of purified cod parvalbumin (see Section I) and anti-cod parvalbumin \nantisera (see Section II), the development of an ELISA for cod parvalbumin was possible.  \nAlthough the existing ELISAs using anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies \nseemed reasonably good, the cod parvalbumin ELISA was developed because an ELISA based \nupon polyclonal antisera might have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider \nrange of species. \n \nB. Methods & Materials \n \nInhibition ELISA\n \nAn indirect ELISA utilizing the rabbit anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies was initially developed. \nThe antibodies were purified using Protein G (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) before \nuse. Using the indirect ELISA in a quantitative determination, a cod extract was analyzed for cod \nparvalbumin content. The extract contained 0.3 ± 0.2 mg/ml cod parvalbumin, in line with an \naverage protein concentration of 2-3 mg/ml. However, further development and testing of the \ninhibition ELISA was abrogated because it was found that a sandwich-type format ELISA was \nmore suitable for quantification of analyte concentrations close to the detection limit. \n \nSandwich ELISA\n \nAll sandwich ELISA experiments were performed with a capture antibody of Protein G-purified \nrabbit anti-parvalbumin antibody (1 µg/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified rabbit \nanti-parvalbumin antibody (500 fold diluted) as the detector antibody. Blocking of remaining \nsites on the microtiter plate was done with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) \ncontaining 3% BSA. The incubation buffer was PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20 \nand the washing buffer consisted of PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. \n \nFish and Fish Maws (Swim Bladders)\n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 18 of 28 \n  \nThe commercial manufacturers of isinglass (study sponsors) provided samples of fish muscle \ntissue and fish maws (common name for swim bladders). \n \nC.

Extracts were made by mixing 1 part of (ground, if necessary) sample \nplus 5 parts of extraction buffer (PBS) for two hours at room temperature, then clarified using \ncentrifugation (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm). \n \nTable 5.1.

Therefore, traces of potentially present parvalbumin should not \nbe hindered from recognition by the matrix.  The matrix with most interference is isinglass.  At \nhalf-maximal reactivity (absorbance approximately 0.35), the difference in reactivity of \nparvalbumin in a 10-fold diluted isinglass extract is estimated to be 2 to 4-fold.  This should be \nconsidered when measuring the parvalbmin content in samples of isinglass that are diluted only \n10-fold. \n \nReactivity of extracts of fish and maw in sandwich ELISA\n \nExtracts of fish and maw samples were prepared and tested in several dilutions in duplicate.   \nFigure 5.3 shows the results for fish and maw extracts.   \n \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 23 of 28 \n  \nFish samples, plateau height = 1.0\n0,000\n0,200\n0,400\n0,600\n0,800\n1,000\n1/5\n1/10 1/20 1/40\n1/80\n1/160 1/320 0\ndilutions\nA490nm\nFA 13/05 fish\nFL 17/18/05 fish\nFA 1/2/05 fish\nFL13/04 fish\n \nFish and maw samples, plateau height = 1.2\n0,000\n0,200\n0,400\n0,600\n0,800\n1,000\n1,200\n1/5\n1/10\n1/20\n1/40 1/801/160\n1/320 0\ndilutions\nA490nm\nJ52/04 fish\nFA 13/05 maw\nFL 17/18/05 maw\nFA 1/2/05 maw\n \nMaw samples, plateau height = 1.0\n0,000\n0,200\n0,400\n0,600\n0,800\n1,000\n1/5\n1/10 1/20 1/40 1/80 1/160 1/320\n0\ndilutions\nA490nm FL 13/04 maw\nF21/05 maw\nJ52/04 maw\n \nFigure 5.3.

Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 24 of 28 \n  \n \nThe majority of the samples did not react substantially.  In the fish extracts, parvalbumin was \npresent based on SDS-PAGE patterns and immunoblotting with anti-cod parvalbumin antisera  .  \nIt was expected that the fish samples would be more reactive than the maw samples, but the \ncontrary was observed.  Maw samples F21/05 and FL13/04 were most reactive. For F21/05 there \nwas no usable fish extract (sample arrived moldy), and fish extract FL13/04 shows a lower \nresponse than maw sample FL13/04.  Of the fish samples, FA 13/05 is most reactive; again no \ndose dependence is observed and the maximum signal is far lower than that of purified \nparvalbumin. \n \nEven although the data show that the tested samples do not react substantially, data from Figure \n3.2 were calculated using the calibration curve of purified cod parvalbumin. Limit of \nquantification is 0.2 ug/g (ppm). Table 5.2 shows the results of the analysis of fish and fish maw \nsamples for parvalbumin using the cod parvalbumin antiserum.  \n \nTable 5.2.

However, with the exception of cod, these fish extracts do not react in the \nELISA.  While some of the maw samples gave weak positive results in this parvalbumin ELISA, \nthese preliminary results are of only limited value.  It may be that the extraction procedure does \nnot recover 100% of the parvalbumin, but it was clearly shown that a 12 kDa band was present \nin the extracts, comparable to extraction in the presence of SDS in the SDS-PAGE studies.  \nThus, incomplete recovery cannot explain the lack of reactivity of the extracts in the sandwich \nELISA for cod parvalbumin. \n Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 25 of 28 \n  \nAnalysis of 11 samples of fish isinglass \nEleven samples of isinglass were analyzed with the sandwich ELISA for cod parvalbumin.  \nTable 5.3 shows the results.  \n \nIt is important to note that the fish species tested within the framework of this project (except \ncod) do not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, even although there is evidence \nfor the presence of parvalbumin, based on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting results. \n \nTable 5.3.

Dilutions of \nisinglass were not parallel with dilutions of cod parvalbumin, and true quantification therefore is \nnot possible. The non-parallelism is illustrated by the high standard deviation (same order of \nmagnitude as response), and by the increasing calculated value for higher diluted extracts (data \nnot shown here).  The non-parallelism may be caused by differences in the affinity of cod \nparvalbumin and parvalbumin of other fishes to the anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  \nDifferences between isinglass samples are apparent.  These may be explained by differences in \nparvalbumin content, but due to the issues mentioned above, this is not conclusive.  It should \nfurthermore be taken into consideration that isinglass matrix inhibits the signal of cod \nparvalbumin slightly (2 to 4 fold). Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 \nUniversity of Nebraska  Page 26 of 28 \n  \n D.  Discussion: \n \nA sandwich ELISA was successfully developed for detection of cod parvalbumin using anti-cod \nparvalbumin polyclonal antisera.  The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not \nsubstantially cross-react with common food ingredients. The ELISA could detect cod \nparvalbumin spiked into isinglass.  The sensitivity of the cod parvalbumin ELISA at 0.20 µg/g is \nexcellent and equivalent or superior to commercial ELISAs for peanut, gluten, and β-\nlactoglobulin.  These results suggested that the sandwich ELISA could be used for measuring \nresidual parvalbumin in isinglass and in  other food matrices. Furthermore, purified parvalbumin \nspiked into beer and wine is not substantially inhibited.  However, some decrease of parvalbumin \nreactivity was observed when purified parvalbumin was spiked into isinglass.  \n \nAlthough the tested fish flesh samples display a 12 kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE that is \nreactive with the anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum (see Figure 4.1), attempts to absolutely \nquantitate the level of parvalbumin in extracts of the muscle tissues and maws of fish species \nused to manufacture isinglass by ELISA were not successful.  Five of 6 maws did not react \neither; in one of the maws, some reactivity was found.  As noted above, several possible reasons \nexist for these unexpected results.  One possibility is the the specificity of the polyclonal anti-\ncod parvalbumin antiserum is not suitable for the detection of parvalbumin in the muscles or \nmaws of these particular species.  However, further research might well allow use of this \nantiserum or some combination of this antiserum with the anti-carp and anti-frog parvalbumin \nmonoclonal antibodies described elsewhere (see FARRP-07-2006)  for the development of an \nELISA that would be reliable for detection of parvalbumin in these muscle and maw extracts.  \nThis research group simply ran out of time to solve this technical problem in meeting the EFSA \ndeadline for submission of data.  Certainly, it would be premature to conclude that these fish and \nmaw samples have low or no parvalbumin. \n \nCuriously, parvalbumin could be detected at low levels in isinglass samples even though it could \nnot be detected in extracts of muscle or maws of the species of fish used to prepare the isinglass.  \nThe reasons for this result are not clear.  The quantitative estimation of parvalbumin levels in \nisinglass is not reliable based upon the problems with the current anti-cod fish parvalbumin \nELISA method.  However, the levels of residual parvalbumin in isinglass are definitely quite \nlow, although it is impossible to indicate exactly how low.  As noted previously, because of the \nwater solubility of parvalbumins, the expectation would be that the parvalbumin is removed from \nisinglass during the washing steps of the isinglass-manufacturing process.  However, fish \ncollagen is used commercially for its ability to entrap and remove materials including proteins \nfrom alcoholic beverages.  Thus, it is not surprising that low levels of parvalbumin might remain \ndespite extensive washing.  \n \n \n \n E.

The isinglass combines with proteins and yeast in suspension in \nthe beer, causing the formation of large flocs which sediment out of the beer. In some \nbeers these flocs are removed in the brewery by filtration of centrifugation. Such beers are \ndescribed as brewery-conditione d beers. However, in some beer styles (known as cask-\nconditioned beers) the flocs ar e not removed but form a compact sediment at the bottom \nof the container (the cask). Only the beer above this sediment is marketable. \n \nA method has been developed wher eby residual isinglass presen t in fined beers can be \nconcentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The separated \nisinglass can then be hydrolysed to its consti tuent acids and quantifie d by measuring the \ncontent of hydroxyproli ne, which is an imino acid present in significant quantities only in \nanimal collagens. The limit of quant ification of this method, t hat is the concentration of \nisinglass in beer which can be distinguished fr om background levels of hydroxyproline, is \n0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry weight basis).  \n \nThis method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which could \nbe present in brewery- and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine whether there is \nlikely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn from a position close to \nthe bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be marketable, could nevertheless contain \nsignificantly higher concentrations of isinglass.  \n \nThe results indicate that residues in many bottled and canned beers fine d with isinglass in \nthe brewery are below t he limit of quantificati on of the method. Wher e isinglass could be \nquantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed 1mg/litre. \n \nFor large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were on ly slightly higher. \nResidues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional samples could \ncontain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beer s, the highest concentration of isinglass \nfound did not exceed 5 mg/litre. \n \nThere was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The \nconcentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above the \nlevel of sedimented material) was marginally  higher than in the bulk, but still below 5 \nmg/litre.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            Page        of   17 4Appendix 3 \nIntroduction and Background \n \nIsinglass is used as a clarif ying (fining) agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage \n(typically 15 mg/litre; total range 10 - 70 mg/ litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it \nreacts with yeast and proteins, forming large flo cs. These flocs are removed from the bulk \nof the liquid by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Thus practically all the isinglass is \nremoved and the product as presented to the c onsumer contains only small quantities of \nresidues.  \n \nAlthough isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for centuries, extensive \nsearches of the scientific and medical litera ture have not identified any documented cases \nof allergy due to the isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of allergic reactions \nto isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all, is extremely rare.  \n \nNew, comprehensive studies into the potential allergenicity of  isinglass have been carried \nout and are reported elsewhere in this dossier. The potential for allergenic reactions to \noccur is also influenced by the amount of residues consumed. Little robust data is \navailable in the lit erature relating to the concentrations of isinglass which remain in fined \nbeers.  This section of the dossier therefore reports on st udies carried out in order to \nquantify more precisely the amount of isinglass present in typical fined beers and also to \ndefine the maximum range of residue levels whic h could remain in t he beer in a worst \ncase.  \n \n \nExperimental approaches \n \nAnalysis of residues \nThe measurement of isinglas s residues in beer is complicated by three factors in \nparticular; \n• The concentration of residues is expected to be low, so one or more concentration \nsteps would be required \n• Isinglass is a protein; beer contains several other proteins  in addition to isinglass, \nand these are present in much larger quantities, making  identification and \nseparation difficult \n• The isinglass residues may include fragments,  making it difficult to separate or \nidentify them using methods based on molecular weight.  \n \nIn the current study, it was decided that th e best approach would be to use an antibody \nraised against isinglass. This would not only introduce specificity and provide a valuable \nconcentration step, but should also allow for the detection of more of the smaller fragments \nof isinglass which might not be precipitated by ammonium sulphate alone.   \n \nThe antibody would be used to collect and c oncentrate the isinglass residues from a \nsample of beer.  In order to quantify these residues use was made of the unusual amino \nacid content of isinglass. Isinglass is a pu re form of collagen, which is characterised by \npresence of hydroxyproline. This  imino acid is rare in other  proteins but is key to the \nstructure and functionality of isinglass. The hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline stabilises the \nhelical structure of collagen thro ugh the formation of H bonds (Moir et al, 1984). As there \nis no other source of collagen in the bre wing process, and since hydroxyproline is not \n                                                            Page        of   17 5Appendix 3 \npresent in significant quantit ies in proteins other than collagen, measurement of \nhydroxyproline in the hydrolyse d residues provides a specific  means of quantification of \nisinglass. \n \nCask-conditioned beers \nFor the overwhelming majority (over 90%) of  fined beers, whether destined for canning, \nbottling or draught, isinglass residues are removed in the brewery by filtration or \ncentrifugation. Cask-conditio ned beer, however, (often described as “real ale”) is a \ntraditional style of be er and is unique to the UK. It r epresents an important traditional \nproduct, but is a niche market, and sales have continued to decline, from almost 17% of \nUK beer sales in 1980 to 6.6% in 2004 (British Beer and Pub Assoc. 2005).   \n \nFigure 1.

T he typical cask ale consumer \ntends to be in the 35+ age gr oup (Table 1) with a high fr equency-low volume consumption \npattern rather than the low frequency-high volume pattern which is more common amongst \nyounger consumers.  \n \nTable 1.

Is inglass is dosed either into \nthe beer before filling or directly into the cask, at a rate of, typically, 50 mg/litre. The action \nof isinglass takes place gener ally within the first 3 to 4 hours after filling so that the \nflocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) rapidly settle to the base of the cask, \nforming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the \nsediment. For this style of beer, the beer serv ed must be bright (i.e. no cloudiness) and be \nfree of suspended particles. Clo udy beer is not acceptable to  the consumer. In order to \nfacilitate the dispense of clear beer, and to  avoid drawing on the sedimented material, \nthere is a gap between the bottom of the cask and the position of the tap. This means that \na certain volume of beer, generally around 2 litres, is not dispensed. This, which is known \nas the ullage, contains the sedimented material, together wit h the overwhelming majority \nof the isinglass. However, it is theoretically possible that t here could be some stratification \nof isinglass residues within the bulk of the ca sk, with lower layers of dispensable beer \npotentially containing more isinglass than t he higher levels. This possibility has been \ninvestigated in order to establish what the “worst case” expo sure might be for the \nconsumer. \n \nFigure 2.

The \nimmunogens were commercial samples of pure isinglass (both powder and paste) \n                                                            Page        of   17 7Appendix 3 \nprovided by the major suppliers of commercial isinglass. Although processing details may \nvary between manufacturers, all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from \nthe same limited range of tropical fish. Thus the isinglass samples used are expected to be \nrepresentative of those marketed for fining beer. The antibodies pr ovided required some \ninitial purification prior to use.  Serum was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C \nusing a Beckman centrifuge.  The supernat ant was carefully poured off and the pellet \ndiscarded.  Ammonium sulphate was slowly added to the supernatant to achieve a final \nconcentration of 30% (saturation), and then sti rred for 30 minutes at room temperature to \nencourage precipitation of IgG.  The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes \nat 4°C, then the supernatant was carefully re moved and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml \nof 0.9% saline (w/v).  The ammonium sulphate precipitation procedure was repeated for a \nsecond time and the resulting pellet was re -suspended in 0.9% salin e.  The purified \nantibody solution was dialysed overnight in  phosphate buffered saline, using dialysis \ntubing with a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cut-off.   The antibody solution was stored in the \nfridge in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide until required. \n \nThe purified antibodies were tested against the immunogen usin g an ELISA protocol. The \nELISA plates were coated with 1 µg of isinglass, using 200 μl of a solution of isinglass per \nwell. Serial dilutions (10 fo ld) of the pre-immune and imm une sera were prepared at the \nsame time. The antisera were in cubated in the treated wells at 37 oC for 30 minutes. The \nreaction was visualised with an alkaline ph osphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and \npara-nitrophenol phosphate at 405 nm. \n \n \nFigure 2.

The pH of  the beer was adjusted to \n7.0, using a magnetic stirrer with drop-wise addition of 3M NaOH, allowing any precipitated \nmaterials to re-dissolve.  It was important that this was done slow ly and that the pH-\nadjusted beer should still be bright. \n \nAntibody (200μl) was added to 100 ml of beer and the mixture was stirred gently at room \ntemperature for 30 minutes. The antibody-ant igen complex was then precipitated using \nammonium sulphate added to 30% saturation.   Again the ammonium sulphate was added \nslowly with constant gently stirring. (30% saturation required 17.6 g of ammonium sulphate \nper 100 ml of beer). The beer/ammonium sulphate mixture, wit h precipitated materials, \nwas stirred for a further 30 minutes. \n \nThe precipitate containing the antibody-isinglass complex was then collected by \ncentrifugation (6500 rpm for 20 minutes) using round bottom centrifuge bottles.  The \nsupernatant was discarded and the pellet was re -dissolved in 16 ml of 20 mM phosphate \nbuffer pH 7, with vortexing. \n \nThe re-dissolved antibody-isinglass complex was then dialysed against deionised water \nusing Spectropore CE dialysis tubing. This dialysis tubing has a molecular weight cut off of \n3.5 kDa (equivalent to approxim ately 25-30 amino acid residu es).  Dialysis was for 20 \nhours with three changes of water. The liquid wa s transferred from the dialysis tubing into \nround bottom flasks and frozen in solid carbon dioxide.  The samples were then reduced to \ndryness in a lyophiliser (usually 48 hours). Hydroxyproline content was then determined on \nthese samples. \n \nHydrolysis of residues to constituent amino acids and derivatisation.  \nTest samples were reconstituted and hydrol ysed to their constituent amino acids using \nHCl. Two ml of 50% HCl was added to the r ound bottom flask to dissolve the sample \nwhich was then transferred to a 4 ml vial and the flask was rinsed with a further 2 ml of HCl \nwhich was also added to the vial. The seal ed vial was then heated for 4 hr at 100 °C then \nallowed to cool prior to derivatisation. \n \nHydroxyproline and other amino acids in the hydrolysate we re derivatised and quantified \nwere using a Phenomenex EZ:faast™ kit, accordi ng to the manufacturer’s instructions. In \nsome cases the identity of the reagents was not  disclosed, the name used here is that \nprovided by the kit manufacturers.   \nEluting Medium, Reagent 3, ( 200 µl) was added to 100 µl of hydrolysate, 95 µl KOH (400 \nmg/ml) and 100 µl of Internal Standard (R eagent 1). After thorough mixing, 50 µl of \nReagent 4 was added to the preparation vial. \n \nThe mixture was emulsified by vortexing for 15 seconds and then allo wed to stand for at \nleast 1 minute. During this period the amino acids were converted to derivatives which \nwere more volatile than the original acids. \n \n                                                            Page        of   17 9Appendix 3 \nThe mixture was re-emulsified by vortexing for at least 15 seconds and again allowed to \nseparate over a period of 1 minute.  Reagent 5 (50 µl) was then added to the mixture, \nwhich was vortexed for 15 seconds and allo wed to stand for 1 minute.  After phase \nseparation, 400 µl of hexane was added to the vial. \n \nThe upper, organic layer was removed to a cl ean vial and gently evaporated to near-\ndryness under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The residue was then re-dissolved in 100 µl of \nTri-Sil TBT.  After 20 minutes , 500 µL of hexane was added to the vial followed by 500 µl \nof water.  The upper, organic layer was removed to a vial for GC-MS analysis. \n \n \nQuantification of Hydroxyproline \nDerivatised hydroxyproline was separated and quantified by gas chromatography with \nmass spectrophotometric detection. The GC -MS was fitted with a Phenomenex ZB-50 \ncolumn and operated in selected ion m onitoring mode. The quant ification ion for \nhydroxyproline was m/z 244,  with 158 and 142 as qualifier ions. Identification was \nconfirmed from retention times and by matchi ng the qualifier ion rati os with those of the \nauthentic compound.  Norvaline was used as the internal standard.  \n \nQuantification was carried out using standard curves prepared by derivatisation of \nsolutions of hydroxyproline over the range 0 - 200 nanomoles/ml. The limit of detection, \ndefined as three times the signal  to noise ratio for a reagent blank, for hydroxyproline on \nthe GC-MS was 40 picomoles/ml or 10 picogr ams injected. Allowing for the concentration \nof the beer during prepar ation of the samples, this corresp onds to a limit of detection of \napproximately 1 µg/litre of hydroxyproline in the beer. The limit of quantification for \nhydroxyproline in beer is approx imately three times the limit of detection, i.e. 3 µg/litre. \nFigures 3 and 4 show total ion and selected ion chromatograms respectively for a 50 \nnmoles/ml hydroxyproline standard. \n \n \nFigure 3.

A cask was obtained  from commercial wholesal er, set up in the BRi beer \ndispense cellar at 12 °C, and allowed to settle for 3 days, as would be usual in commercial \npractice.  \nThe sampling protocol was designed to simulate a situation in a retail outlet in which beer \nis supplied to customers intermittently over several days. A 1 litre sample was taken via \nthe tap and retained for analysis.  The next day several litres were drawn off and a further \nsample taken for analysis. This was repeated over the next week until the cask was almost \nempty and the beer sample was unaccept ably cloudy and would not have been \nmarketable. This sample represents the beginnings of the ullage.  \n \nIn addition, single samples were taken of a number of other brands of  cask ale. In these \ncases the samples were taken when the casks were approximately half empty.  \n \nKeg beer \nA keg containing an international brand of brewery-conditioned beer was set up in the BRi \ncellar and sampled as described for the ca sk-conditioned ale, except that, since \nsedimented material had been removed by filt ration in the brewery, the bottom samples \nremained clear and marketable.  \n                                                            Page        of   17 12Appendix 3 \nResults \n \nBackground levels of hydroxyproline in beer \nIn order to establish the backg round levels, if any, of hydr oxyproline in beer, control beers \nwere prepared in the BRI pilo t brewery without using any is inglass.

Within the bulk of the cask (t hat is, the beer which would \nbe served to the customer) isinglass residues remained below 3 mg/ litre, with a mean of \n1.8 mg/litre and no evidence of stratification. The last sample which was drawn was \nnoticeably hazy to the naked eye, and this cont ained a higher concentration of isinglass, \n                                                            Page        of   17 14Appendix 3 \n3.6 mg/litre. Samples drawn fr om below this point represen ted the ullage, and contained \nvisible yeast and protein clumps. The concentrati on of isinglass at this level was very high \n(> 100 mg/litre) but since it was associated with the solid material, the distribution was \nnon-homogeneous and difficult to determine with any accuracy. \n \nSamples were also taken from a number of other brands of cask al e, including one micro-\nbrewery brand, and tested for isinglass residues. These were taken from casks \napproximately half empty. Results are shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5. Isinglass residues in cask ales.  \n \nSample mg hydroxyproline / litre \nbeer \nmg isinglass  / litre beer \n(dry weight basis) \nBrand 1 0.112 2.1 \nBrand 2 0.029 0.6 \nBrand 3 0.014 0.3 \nBrand 4 0.117 2.2 \nBrand 5 0.084 1.6 \nBrand 6 0.219 4.2 \nBrand 7 0.014 0.3 \n \nConcentrations of isinglass in these 7 brands were similar to those found in the \nstratification study, with the highest concentr ation found being 4.2 mg/litre. This suggests \nthat the cask chosen for the st ratification study was representative of other brands of cask \nale.  \n \nDiscussion  \n \nThe studies reported here indicate that the overwhelming majority of the isinglass added to \nbeer as a fining agent is either removed in the brewery (for brewer y-conditioned beers) or \nis contained in the sediments at the botto m of the cask (for cask-conditioned beers). In \neach case, the concentrations of isingla ss contained in the beer marketed and consumed \nby the drinker are extremely low. Precise quantif ication of the resi dues which could be \nconsumed is complicated by the presence of a wide range of other proteins, by the likely \nheterogeneous nature of the isinglass residues themselves an d by the fact that the levels \nare close to the limits of quantification. These complications have undoubtedly reduced the \nprecision of the determinations.  \n \nOnly a few other attempts to quantify isingla ss residues in beer hav e been reported. One \nmethod has been developed in New Zealand, (Hofman & MacDonald, 2002). The details \nof this method are not publicly available, bu t it is understood to be based on the classic \nbiochemical principles of prec ipitation of the prot ein by ammonium su lphate, followed by \nseparation of the protein molecu les on the basis of size and el ectrical charge. Using this \nmethod, levels of isinglass residues in a small number of commercial beers from Australia \nand New Zealand (all brewery- conditioned brands) were found to be in the range 0.02 - \n0.16 mg/litre (Hofman et al, 2002) . These values are similar to those found in the current \nstudy for small-pack brewery conditioned lagers. They ar e lower than some of the \nbrewery-conditioned ales tested,  but this is not surprising given the different brewing \nstyles. In addition, any method based on molecu lar size runs the risk of missing fragments \n                                                            Page        of   17 15Appendix 3 \nwhich may (but also may not) have the same or  similar allergenic potential to the parent \nmolecule.  One advantage of th e antibody method used in the pr esent study is that both \nparent molecule and larger fragments should be detected.  \n \nOther groups have also used hydroxyproline measurement as a means of detecting or \nquantifying isinglass (Leach, 1969; Chlup et al, 2006). The first of these (Leach, 1969) \nwas a colorimetric test, and was qualitative only, since the amount of hydroxyproline \npresent was too small to quantify with the techniques available at that time. It was used for \ndetermining whether or not a beer had been fined with isinglass. More recently a group at \nthe Heriot-Watt University in Scotland also  used determination of hydroxyproline as a \nmethod of quantifying isinglass residues in beer (Chlup et al, 2006). This group, who were \nnot using any concentration techniques, found that although hydr oxyproline could be \ndetected in cask beers immediately after the fi nings were added, the levels fell to below \nthe limit of detection once the beer had settled (typically  2 -3 days).   \n \nAs previously noted, hydroxypro line is generally considered to occur at significant levels \nonly in animal collagen. Howeve r, there are published reports in  the scientific literature of \nglycoproteins containing hydr oxyproline in higher plants (Cleland, 1968; Stuart and \nVarner, 1980).The current study did detec t low levels of hydroxyproline in beer which had \nnot been treated with finings. This has not been previously reported, probably because \nmethods have not been sufficiently sensitive. If barley contained similar proteins, any \nfragments remaining in the beer would hav e been concentrated by  the extraction \nprocedure used in the study repor ted here. Thus the background levels of hydroxyproline \ndetected in unfined beer are a likely consequence of the low limit of detection of the \nmethod used.  \n \nIn the current study, cask beer was sampled on a daily basis, over a total time period of \none week, with the final samples being drawn from close to the sedimented material, \nwhere they appeared visibly cloudy. In fact, the flavour of a cask beer will begin to \ndeteriorate if it is not cons umed within 3-4 days after tapping. Thus in commercial practice \ncasks may be replaced before a ll the marketable beer has been consumed. Thus the \nmaximum concentrations detected in this study are likely to represent a “worst case” as far \nas dietary exposure for the consumer is concerned.  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe results of the study reported here confirm that the concentration of residues remaining \nin beers fined with isinglass is indeed very low. For many bottled and canned beers, levels \nof isinglass are below the lim it of quantification.  Slightly higher concentrations may be \nfound in beers in large containers such as  kegs and casks, but even here the maximum \nconcentrations would be likely to remain bel ow 5 mg/litre. There is no evidence of \nsignificant stratification of isinglass resi dues in the marketable beer in such bulk \ncontainers.  \n \n \n                                                            Page        of   17 16Appendix 3 \n \nReferences \n \n \nBritish Beer and Pub Association, Statistical Handbook 2005.  \n \nCleland, R., Plant Physiol. 1968 June; 43(6): 865–870. “Distribution and Metabolism of \nProtein-Bound Hydroxyproline in an Elongating Tissue, the Avena Coleoptile” \n \nChlup, P.H., Leiper, K.A.  and Stewart, G.G., 2006, J.

Intertek Health Sciences Inc. \ntherefore conducted a comprehensive literature search using the electronic search tool ProQuest Dialog™ \n(ProQuest) on 20 June 2025. Details of the search strategy, including the inclusion/exclusion criteria for \nliterature filtration, are provided in Section 2.0. The results of the literature search are provided in Section \n3.0. \n2.0 LITERATURE SEARCH METHODOLOGY \n2.1 Search Strategy \nThe following databases were searched using ProQuest: Adis Clinical Trials Insight, AGRICOLA, AGRIS, \nAllied & Complementary Medicine™, BIOSIS® Toxicology, BIOSIS Previews®, CAB ABSTRACTS, Embase®, \nFoodline®: SCIENCE, FSTA®, MEDLINE®, NTIS: National Technical Information Service, ToxFile®, and \nToxicology Abstracts.  \nKeywords related to the test article (i.e., parvalbumin or isinglass) were searched in combination with \nkeywords related to its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, wine, brew, alcohol). Results \nwere further refined using keywords related to allergenicity including terms related to allergenicity, \nhypersensitivity, and anaphylaxis.  \nFor an article to be identified, at least 1 keyword from each of the relevant combined sets of keywords had \nto appear either in the title, abstract, or body of the text. The search terms and strategy are presented in \nTable 2.1-1 below. \nTable 2.1-1 Search Strategy Used to Retrieve Literaturea \nSet # Search Terms  Number of Titles \nS1 Parvalbumin or isinglass 36,147b \nS2 s1 and (beer or wine or brew* or alcohol*) 866 \nS3 S2 and (allerg* or hypersensitiv* OR hypersensitiz* OR hypersensitis* or anaphyla*) 77 \na For an article to be identified, at least 1 keyword from each of the relevant combined sets of keywords had to appear either in \nthe title, abstract, or body of the article. The asterisk indicates a truncation so as not to place a limitation on the word ending \n(e.g., “allerg*” would result in the identification of “allergen,” “allergies,” and “allergenicity”). \nb Duplicates are included in the results count.  CONFIDENTIAL \n  \n \n \nMascoma LLC \n18 July 2025 3 \n2.2 Literature Filtration \nOnce the search strategy was implemented and the publication titles were retrieved, the relevance of the \npublications was determined at 3 stages using the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the publications. At each \nstage, the exclusion criteria listed in Table 2.2-1 were applied to determine literature relevance. The \n3 stages of literature filtration are outlined below in greater detail. \nStage 1: Titles of articles were reviewed, and abstracts of titles determined to be potentially relevant \nwere retrieved. \nStage 2:  Abstracts were reviewed, and full-length articles of abstracts determined to be potentially \nrelevant were retrieved. \nStage 3:  Full-length articles were reviewed, and those determined to meet any one of the exclusion \ncriteria specified in Table 2.2-1 were excluded. \nTable 2.2-1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Used to Filter the Identified Literature \nInclusion Criteria \n• The substance studied was relevant to parvalbumin or isinglass and its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages \n• The publication was a full-length article published in a peer-reviewed journal \n• The publication investigated allergenicity parameters \nExclusion Criteria \n• The substance studied was not relevant to parvalbumin or isinglass and its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages \n• The publication was a full-length article published in a non-peer-reviewed source (website, magazine, etc.) \n• The publication was published in abstract form only or as a short communication (conference abstract, letter to the editor, \ncommentary, etc.) \n• The publication did not consider allergenicity parameters \n• The study was a duplicate record in the literature search \n• The full publication study report was not in English language \n3.0 LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTS \nAs illustrated in Figure 3-1, the literature search resulted in the identification of 77 potentially relevant \ntitles, and abstracts were retrieved for 17 of the records. Of the 17 abstracts, 12 were considered to be \npotentially relevant, and the full-length articles were retrieved. Of the full-length articles assessed, 2 met \nthe exclusion criteria; therefore, 10 full-length studies were identified pertaining to the allergenicity of \nparvalbumin or isinglass used in beer production. A list of the 10 full-length studies identified as relevant to \nthe allergenicity of isinglass or parvalbumin in the brewing of alcoholic beverages is presented in Table 3-1. \nThe results of the title search are provided in Appendix A.

This is why the European Parliament \nadopted Directive 2003/89/EC amending 2000/13/EC. In addition to specific ingredients, Directive 2003/89/EC also requests the \ndeclaration of specific products that were used in the production and could be a risk for allergic individuals. This also includes the \ndeclaration of fining agents and lysozyme used in wines. In fact, it could be assumed that fining agents would be almost \ncompletely removed during the manufacturing process; however, until now there has been no necessity to analyze wine for these \nfining agents. By applying enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), residuals of fining agent proteins and the stabilizer \nlysozyme were investigated in various German wines. The results showed no detectable amounts of fining agents in wines, except \nfor dried egg white and lysozyme, both derived from hen\'s egg white. For those products, adverse reactions against treated wines \ncould not be excluded. \nPotential food allergens in wine: double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and basophil activation analysis  \n \nAuthor: Rolland, Jennifer M 1 ; Apostolou, Effie; Deckert, Kirsten; de Leon, Maria P; Douglass, Jo A; Glaspole, Ian N; Bailey, \nMichael; Stockley, Creina S; O\'Hehir, Robyn E 1 Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, Australia \n \nPublication details: Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.) 22.9 (Sep 2006): 882-8. \n \nAbstract (English):  \nOBJECTIVE \nRecent Australian and international legislation requires labeling of wines made by using the potentially allergenic food proteins \ncasein, milk, egg white, or isinglass (fish-derived) where “there is a detectable residual processing aid.” We investigated whether \nwines fined using these proteins or non-grape-derived tannins (tree-nut derived) can provoke significant clinical allergic reactions \n(anaphylaxis) in patients with confirmed immunoglobulin E-mediated relevant food allergy. \n \nMETHODS \nA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine whether allergic reactions followed consumption of \nAustralian commercial wines fined using one or more of the legislation-targeted food proteins. In addition, allergenicity of a larger \npanel of these wines was evaluated by blood basophil activation. \n \nRESULTS \nNo anaphylaxis was induced by wine consumption. Three mild clinical reactions to protein-fined wine and two mild reactions to \nunfined wine occurred, but there was no statistically significant difference in reaction parameters between subject groups or \nbetween processing aids. No pattern of basophil activation correlated with wine type, processing aid, or subject group. \n \nCONCLUSION \nWines fined with egg white, isinglass, or non-grape-derived tannins present an extremely low risk of anaphylaxis to fish-, egg-, or \npeanut-allergic consumers. Although consumption of milk protein-fined wine did not induce anaphylaxis, there were insufficient \nsubjects to determine statistically whether wines fined with milk proteins present a risk to the very rare milk-allergic consumers. \nIn summary, the observed lack of anaphylaxis and basophil activation induced by wines made using the legislation-targeted food \nproteins according to good manufacturing practice suggests negligible residual food allergens in these wines.

Food allergen labeling is the principal means of protecting sensitized individuals. \nThis motivated European Directive 2003/89 on the labeling of ingredients or additives that could trigger adverse reactions, which \nhas been in effect since 2005. During this study, we developed animal models with allergy to ovalbumin, caseinate, and isinglass \nin order to be able to detect fining agent residues that could induce anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. The second aim of \nthe study was to design sandwich ELISA tests specific to each fining agent in order to detect their residue antigenicity, both during \nwine processing and in commercially available bottled wines. Sensitized mice and sandwich ELISA methods were established to \ntest a vast panel of wines. The results showed that although they were positive to our highly sensitive sandwich-ELISA tests, some \ncommercially available wines are not allergenic in sensitized mice. Commercially available bottled wines made using standardized \nprocesses, fining, maturation, and filtration, do not therefore represent any risk of anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. \nAllergenicity of wine containing processing aids: a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge  \n \nAuthor: Kirschner, S 1 ; Belloni, B; Kugler, C; Ring, J; Brockow, K 1 Department of Dermatology and Allergy Biederstein, Technische \nUniversität München, Munich, Germany, Germany \n \nPublication details: Journal of Investigational Allergology & Clinical Immunology 19.3 (2009): 210-7. \n \nAbstract (English):  \nBACKGROUND \nThe European Union requires allergenic food ingredients to appear on labels in order to protect allergic consumers. \n \nOBJECTIVE \nTo determine whether traces of egg-, milk-, and fish-derived processing aids used in winemaking might elicit clinical reactions in \nfood-allergic patients. \n \nMETHODS \nFive German wines were fined with a high dose of egg albumin, lysozyme, milk casein, fish gelatin, or isinglass, and filtered. \nFourteen adults with allergy to egg (n = 5), milk (n = 5), or fish (n = 4) were included. Skin prick tests were performed with fining \nagents, and fined and unfined wines. All patients underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges with fined and \nunfined wines. \n \nRESULTS \nSkin prick tests were positive to hen\'s egg (n = 5), ovalbumin (n = 5), lysozyme (n = 4), cow\'s milk (n = 5), casein (n = 4), and cod \n(n = 3), but not to isinglass or fish gelatin (n = 0). Positive skin prick test results were observed for wines fined with albumin \n(n = 3), lysozyme (n = 2), casein (n = 1), gelatin (n = 0), and isinglass (n = 3), and for unfined wines (n = 1-2 in each patient group), \nwith no significant differences between groups. Seventy-five percent of skin test-positive patients had specific immunoglobulin E \nto other allergens present in wine (eg, carbohydrates). The provocation test revealed no reactions to fined or unfined wines. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nAlthough concentrated fining agents containing ovalbumin, lysozyme, and casein were allergenic in the skin prick test, no patient \nreacted adversely in the provocation test to fined wine. Wines treated with fining agents at commercial concentrations appear \nnot to present a risk to allergic individuals when filtered.

There is a call for products processed with these fish-derived compounds to be labelled, \nfor reasons of food safety (potential allergenicity), religious and ethical concerns and consumer protection. The aim of this study \nwas to develop a reliable and sensitive method for the detection of FG and IG in foods. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against \nfish collagen and used to develop a sensitive indirect ELISA for the detection of FG and IG. Levels of less than 0.11 mcg/ml of FG \nand IG were detected and the method was successfully applied to the determination of FG and IG in wines. Wines, which had \nbeen processed with FG or IG and which had not been additionally treated with bentonite (for protein adsorption) and successive \nfiltration, were found to have residues of up to 0.33 mcg/ml of FG and/of IG. \nRisk of allergic reactions to wine, in milk, egg and fish-allergic patients  \n \nAuthor: Vassilopoulou, Emilia 1 ; Karathanos, Athanassios; Siragakis, George; Giavi, Stavroula; Sinaniotis, Athanassios; Douladiris, \nNikolaos; Fernandez-Rivas, Montserrat; Clausen, Michael; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G 1 Allergy Research Centre, 2nd Department \nof Pediatrics, University of Athens, Greece, Greece emivasil@hotmail.com \n \nPublication details: Clinical and Translational Allergy 1.1 (Oct 17, 2011): 10. \n \nAbstract (English):  \nBACKGROUND \nEuropean legislators and wine producers still debate on the requirement for labeling of wines fined with potentially allergenic \nfood proteins (casein, egg white or fish-derived isinglass). We investigated whether wines fined with known concentrations of \nthese proteins have the potential to provoke clinical allergic reactions in relevant patients. \n \nMETHODS \nIn-house wines were produced for the study, fined with different concentrations of casein (n = 7), egg albumin (n = 1) and \nisinglass (n = 3). ELISA and PCR kits specific for the respective proteins were used to identify the fining agents. Skin prick tests and \nbasophil activation tests were performed in patients with confirmed IgE-mediated relevant food allergies (n = 24). A wine \nconsumption questionnaire and detailed history on possible reactions to wine was obtained in a multinational cohort of milk, egg \nor fish allergic patients (n = 53) and patients allergic to irrelevant foods as controls (n = 13). \n \nRESULTS \nFining agents were not detectable in wines with the available laboratory methods. Nevertheless, positive skin prick test reactions \nand basophil activation to the relevant wines were observed in the majority of patients with allergy to milk, egg or fish, \ncorrelating with the concentration of the fining agent. Among patients consuming wine, reported reactions were few and mild \nand similar with the ones reported from the control group.

The \nantibodies were tested for specificity and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using these antibodies. \nThe ELISA was applied to measure parvalbumin in cod skin, the starting material for fish gelatin made from deep sea, wild fish. \nThe ELISA was sufficiently sensitive (LLOQ = 0.8 ng ml (-1) in extracts, corresponding to 0.02 µg of parvalbumin per g of tissue), \nand did not cross-react with common food constituents. Fish gelatin, wine and beer, matrices for the potential use of this ELISA, \ndid not cause disturbance of the assay performance. The data show that the parvalbumin content in cod muscle tissue is 6.25 mg \ng (-1), while the skins contained considerably less, 0.4 mg g (-1) Washing of the skins, a common industrial procedure during the \nmanufacturing of fish gelatin, reduced the level of parvalbumin about 1000-fold to 0.5 µg g (-1), or 0.5 ppm. From 95 commercial \nlots of fish gelatin it is shown that 73 are below 0.02 µg g (-1) parvalbumin. From the other 22 lots, the one with the highest \nconcentration contained 0.15 µg g (-1) of parvalbumin. These levels are generally assumed to be safe for fish-allergic individuals. \nAllergenic proteins in enology: a review on technological applications and safety aspects  \n \nAuthor: Peñas, Elena 1 ; di Lorenzo, Chiara 2 ; Uberti, Francesca 2 ; Restani, Patrizia 2 1 Institute of Food Science, Nutrition and \nTechnology (ICTAN-CSIC), Juan de la Cierva 3, Madrid 28006, Spain, Spain elenape@ictan.csic.es 2 Dipartimento di Scienze \nFarmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Università degli Studi di Milano, via Balzzaretti 9, Milano 20133, Italy, Italy \nuberti_francesca@libero.it ; patrizia.restani@unimi.it \n \nPublication details: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland) 20.7 (Jul 21, 2015): 13144-64. \n \nAbstract (English):  \nProteinaceous products are widely used as fining agents during winemaking to remove unwanted insoluble particles and \nundissolved microscopic particles (colloidal material) from the must or wine to improve stability. Some of them (egg white, \ncaseinates, and fish gelatine) have allergenic potential and the presence of their residues in the final product could represent a \nrisk for allergic individuals. Moreover, lysozyme (an egg allergen) is included among wine additives to control the fermentation \nprocesses and avoid spoiling during winemaking. The aim of this paper is to review the experimental/clinical data on the use of \nallergenic products in enology and the measurement of relative risk for sensitized subjects. In addition, methods developed \nspecifically for the quantification of allergenic residues in must and wine are described.

Hypersensitivity reactions due to alcoholic drinks, mainly in the form of airway reactions (rhinitis and asthma), occur \nsignificantly more frequently in persons with pre-existing rhinitis and asthma. In terms of pathogenesis, it has to be differentiated \nbetween immunologic, mainly IgE-mediated, hypersensitivity reactions (wine allergies), and intolerance reactions in which no \ncausative allergen-specific immune mechanisms can be detected. Allergens responsible for wine allergy could be: grape (Vitis \nvinifera) proteins (particularly the major allergen lipid transfer protein Vit v1), proteins and ingredients used for the fining of \nwines such as fish gelatin or isinglass (swim bladder of the fish huso, family of sturgeons), ovalbumin, dairy (casein) products, gum \narabic, enzymes (lysozyme, pectinase, glucanase, cellulase, glucosidase, urease, aromatic enzymes), molds (particularly Botrytis \ncinerea) responsible for the noble rot in wines, yeasts and proteins from insects that contaminated the mash. Type 1 allergic \nreactions (positive prick tests) have been described for inorganic components like ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and sulfites, \nbut no specific IgE could be detected in the serum. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid, flavonoids (anthocyanins and \nchatechines), sulfites, histamine and other biogenic amines are the main causative agents of intolerance reactions (pseudoallergic \nreactions) to wine. After a short historic review of viticulture and the importance of wine in classical antiquity, we go into the \nchemical processes of alcoholic fermentation and the genetically inherited “flush syndrome” caused by an acetaldehyde \ndehydrogenase 2 polymorphism, subsequently we focus on the different etiologic factors of allergies and intolerance reactions to \nwine. The most frequent intolerance reactions to sulfites occur particularly after the ingestion of white wine and in asthma \npatients. Intolerance reactions to histamine and other biogenic amines occur mainly after ingestion of red wine and in persons \nwith diamine oxidase (DAO) deficiency. \n  CONFIDENTIAL \n  \n \n \nMascoma LLC \n18 July 2025 10 \nDISCLAIMER \nIntertek Health Sciences Inc.

July 2006 \n \nPage 1 of 12 Page 2 of 12 \nIntroduction  \nIsinglass is a pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of specific tropical \nand subtropical fish, known in the industry as “maws”. Only certain species are selected for \nthe isinglass used in brewing. These are certain catfish, croakers and threadfins.  \n \nSwim bladders are part of the buoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs \nsituated in the dorsal area of the body cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) \nmuscles which make up the fish ""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the \nbody cavity, thus when the fish are harvested, these swim bladders are readily detached and \nremoved from the body of the fish without extr aneous tissue. Because of this, the levels of \nparvalbumin, which is the major allergen in fish and is found mainly in fish muscle, are low. \nStudies using an ELISA test for fish parvalbumin indicate that levels of parvalbumin in the \nswim bladders of those fish used for isinglass manufacture are in the range 7 – 30 mg/kg carp \nparvalbumin equivalents. These levels of parvalbumin are reduced to some extent during \nnormal processing to prepare commercial isinglass products but can be further minimised by \nthe use of buffer washes. Studies using the ELISA test referred to above indicate that normal \nprocessing reduces the range of parvalbumin concentrations slightly, but the introduction of an \nextra step of washing with phosphate buffer can achieve a significantly higher reduction. A \nCode of Good Manufacturing Practice, based on HACCP principles, has been developed by \nthe BFBi in order to minimise levels of parvalbumin in their commercial isinglass-based \nproducts and to provide a common quality system for the industry. It is intended as a generic \nindustry guide which has been adopted by the manufacturers concerned and has been \nincorporated into each company’s own HACCP system. \n \nManufacture of isinglass  \n \n1. Raw materials – pre-requisites \n \n1.1 Sourcing \nAnalysis using the ELISA test has shown that levels of parvalbumin in swim bladders (maws) \ncan vary between species. Consequently, only certain species are selected for the \nmanufacture of isinglass. These are  \n• Arius africanus  (sea catfish) \n• Arius dussumieri (blacktip catfish) \n• Arius maculatus (spotted catfish) \n• Bagrus docmak (bagrid catfish) \n• Bagrus Pseudopimelodus spp Bagre Blanco  (S.American White Catfish) \n• Cynoscions acoupa (Corvina del Lago) \n \nMaws for use by isinglass manufacturers are usually purchased from the same traders that \nsupply the food market (the culinary market, for Chinese restaurants and delicatessen \nbusinesses, accounts for most of the volume of maws traded). These traders must be licensed \nto deal in foodstuffs by the Health Authorities in their respective countries. It is important for \nquality reasons that any maws destined for brewing and other beverage applications are \ncleaned and dried as soon as possible after being removed from the fish. Drying must be at \nambient temperature in a good airflow without exposure to direct sunlight, which can cause \ndamage through overheating (denaturation of the collagen). Great care must be taken during \ndrying to avoid damaged by microbial growth.   \n \n1.2 Packaging and Traceability Requirements \nThe isinglass manufacturers specify that maws should be packed in new, food grade sacks \nand that shipping marks etc should not be sprayed/stenciled on the bags in such a way as to Page 3 of 12 \ncontaminate the maws inside with paint/ink. Maws should not be contaminated with pesticide \nresidues. \n \nTo ensure traceability each sack must be marked with  \n• Supplier’s identification and lot number \n• maw type (species) \n• net weight \n \nAnalytical specifications and visual checks at intake are used by the isinglass manufacturers \nto ensure the quality of their raw materials and that these pre-requisites have been met. \nSamples for pesticide residue analysis are taken after the milling stage of processing. \n \n1.3 Analytical specifications \nThe following analytical specifications are set  \n• Moisture                   16-22% ideally 17-19% \n• Protein                    >93% \n• Acid Soluble Protein           >90% \n• Collagen                   >88% \n \n \n2. Manufacturing process \n \nGood Manufacturing Practices for the production of Food Grade products are applied \nthroughout the entire process. Isinglass products are very heat sensitive. Temperatures in \nexcess of 18°C are therefore avoided during the manufacturing process to prevent damage to \ncollagen (the active ingredient in isinglass). \n \nA flow diagram for the manufacturing process showing the HACCP Critical Control Points is \ngiven in Figure 1.  \n \n2.1 Visual assessment (Critical Control Point No. 1) \nThe outer packaging is removed and the fish maws are placed on a moving conveyor screen \nto remove fine dust particle and other loose material. The conveyor also allows the maws to \nbe examined visually and any of doubtful quality to be removed. \n \nMaws are assessed visually to ensure that they are; \n• visually clean and free from infestation \n• free from tissue and fat residues  \n• true in shape for the fish species specified \n• whole  \n• not discloured (ideally of a pale yellow/straw colour) \n \nSupplier details and fish maw variety are recorded so the source and quality can be traced \nthroughout the processing.  \n \n2.1 Cleaning (Critical Control Point No. 2) \nThe maws are then passed over a screen to remove foreign material such as metal fish hooks \netc.  \n \n2.2 Milling (Critical Control Points No. 3 and 4) \nThe maws are first chopped so that they will pass through a 25mm screen. This finer particle \nsize has two effects: \n Page 4 of 12 \n• it increases the surface area thus improving the extent of extraction of parvalbumin in \nthe subsequent buffer wash \n• it ensures adequate sterilising during the peroxide wash  \n \nThe chopped product is then sieved to remove fines. The dry isinglass is then stored until \nrequired for processing. Details of the supplier and fish species are recorded for traceability. \nMetal fragments are removed by magnets, generally positioned between the mill and the \nscreens.  \nA representative sample of the fine milled material is taken for pesticide residue analysis. \n \n2.3 Sterilising (Critical Control Point No. 5).  \nWhen required for processing, the dry chopped maws are transferred to the wet processing \narea. Here they are first sterilised by soaking in a solution of hydrogen peroxide and soaked \nfor a minimum of 16 hours with intermittent stirring at approximately 4 hour intervals. The \nmaws are then passed over a fine screen to remove the soluble impurities and fine insoluble \nmaterial with the spent peroxide solution. The isinglass retained on the screen is rinsed with \nwater. \n \n2.4  Buffer wash (Critical Control Point No. 6) \nThe insoluble isinglass is then soaked in phosphate buffered saline (0.15M NaCl, 0.01M \nNa\n2HPO4,pH7) for a minimum of 1 hour, drained, rinsed, then washed twice more with fresh \nwater and finally drained. \n \n This washing cycle removes the parvalbumin (whi ch is readily soluble at pH 7) from the \nisinglass, which is insoluble. The resultant wet isinglass is then further processed to a form \nsuitable for the end user.  \n \n2.5 Further processing \nIsinglass is sold in 3 different forms. \n1. Powder \n2. Aqueous Paste \n3. Aqueous Liquid. \nAs mentioned earlier, for quality reasons it is critical to keep temperature <18 oC to prevent \nisinglass denaturing for both liquids and pastes. \n \n \nPowder: \nAfter washing, the wet isinglass is dried, either by freeze drying or using a low temperature air \ndrier. The dried isinglass is then milled to a powder. It can be sold in this form to the user who \ndissolves it in dilute food grade acid prior to use. Alternatively, it may be blended with a \npowdered food grade organic acid by the isinglass manufacturer and sold to the end user as a \nready-to-use powder. \n \nAqueous Paste:   \nAfter washing, the wet isinglass is added to water or to a buffer solution containing approved \npreservatives. This mix is then homogenised to give a fine paste for sale to the end user, who \ndissolves the paste in dilute food grade acid prior to use. \n \n \nAqueous Liquid: \nAfter washing, the wet Isinglass is dissolved in dilute food grade acid solution containing \napproved preservatives. The resultant solution is then sold to the end user who further dilutes \nit with water prior to use.

Executive Summary  \n  \nThis petition is submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers  \nAssociation (BFBi) in support of a request for exemption from the labelling requirements of \nSection 403(w)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass \nwhen used as a fining/clarification processing aid in beer. This request is being sought on \nthe grounds of: \n \n• clinical evidence (Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge) that fish sensitive     \nindividuals do not have allergic responses to isinglass, even when challenged with very high \noral doses   \n• the manufacturing process for isinglass minimizes allergenic potential  \n• extremely low potential for dietary exposure to isinglass through beer consumption  \n• long history of safe use  \n• absence of published reports of allergenicity   \n  \nThis document presents details on:    \n1. composition and characterization of isinglass.  \n2. development of an ELISA method for the detection of parvalbumin (the allergenic \nmolecule generally associated with fish allergenicity) and it’s use in the \nquantification of parvalbumin in isinglass raw materials (‘fish maws’) and in \ncommercially available, processed isinglass products. \n3. development of an ELISA method for the detection of residual isinglass in beer \ntogether with analytical results for levels of residual isinglass found in commercial \nbeers. \n4. a ‘Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Isinglass’ adopted by the major \nproducers of isinglass and specifically designed to minimize parvalbumin levels in \ncommercial isinglass products. \n5. expected level of consumer exposure to isinglass and associated parvalbumin \n6. comprehensive literature searches was conducted to identify any documented \ninstances of confirmed allergenic responses related to isinglass or to beers treated \nwith isinglass. \n7. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and double blind placebo  \ncontrolled oral challenge tests), carried out in Denmark and Switzerland and the \nassociated protocols used.  \n8. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and oral challenge tests),   \ncarried out in France and the associated protocols used. \n \n \nThe scientific studies described herein were conducted during the period 2004-2007 in \nsupport of a submission by BFBi and The Brewers of Europe for an exemption from Annex \nIIIa of EU Directive 2005/26/EC and thus from the requirement to label isinglass, under \nallergen labelling regulations, when used as a clarifying aid in brewing.   Page 4 of 26 \n \nThe petitioners note that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered their \nOpinion (adopted on 6th July 2007), concluding that ‘the Panel considers that it is not very \nlikely that isinglass used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic reaction in \nsusceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use specified’ (Appendix \n11). Isinglass was subsequently granted a permanent exemption from allergen labelling, \nthis exemption being granted for both beer and wine (Appendix 11A). \nIt is also noted that Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) deliberated on a \nrequest by the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand, an application subsequently \ntaken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand, for the exemption of isinglass from \nallergen labelling requirement when used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. FSANZ \nundertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public health and safety implications \nand concluded that since residual isinglass in beer and wine, if present, did not exceed \n1mg/liter of bottled beer or wine and since parvalbumin was demonstrated to co-sediment \nwith and thus be removed by sedimentation or filtration then the consumption of isinglass-\nfined beer and wine was not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic \nconsumers. FSANZ also deliberated on the wider aspects of such allergen labelling \nrequirements, including potential impact on consumer choice, cost to industry, cost to \nGovernment enforcement agencies, and international trade considerations. FSANZ \napproved an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present \nin beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent (Appendix 12) \nIt is the position of Health Canada that if an ingredient derived from Canada\'s priority a food \nallergen source (like a fining agent) is added to a food during its production but later is \nremoved from the food, so that it is no longer present in the finished food, then that will not \ntrigger the application of Canada’s allergen labelling regulations. This is the situation for \nmost commercial wines even where the a  food allergen source of the derived fining agent \nis used is from food considered a priority allergen source (i.e. the priority that the allergen \nfood source derived fining agent is added to the wine but later removed by effective \nfiltration and is no longer present in the finished wine). The fact that the protein from the \nfood allergen is not present in the finished wine means that the use of the fining agent is not \nexpected to pose a risk to allergic consumers, and so allergen labelling regulations would \nnot be triggered. \nWith regards to the use of isinglass in beer, isinglass is derived from the dried swim \nbladders of fish and consists primarily of collagen, which is a protein.  If the isinglass is used \nas a fining agent in the beer but is then removed by filtration or some other method and the \nisinglass is no longer present in the finished beer, then no labelling would be \nrequired.  Health Canada have taken the view that any protein present in an ingredient \nderived from a priority food allergen source should be regarded as a potential allergen. The \npublished studies, including food challenge clinical tests,  clearly indicate that collagen, the \nprimary protein in isinglass, does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive individuals. \nIt is the opinion of the petitioners that the scientific evidence and conclusions presented \nherein remain valid and, in particular, the clinical studies described remain in line with \ncurrent best practice for assessing allergenic potential of a food substance. Page 5 of 26 \n \nThe petitioners are supportive of informative allergen labelling. The petitioners \nacknowledge that ‘fish’ is a common cause of allergies and that fish-derived material may \nalso contain potential allergens. However, all available published evidence indicates that \nisinglass, when used as a beer fining agent, does not cause an allergic response that poses a \nrisk to human health when consumed by fish sensitive individuals.  \n  \nIsinglass used in brewing is a pure form of collagen (greater than 92% collagen on a  \ndry, ash free basis). It is derived from the swim bladders of specific physostomatous  \ntropical and sub-tropical fish. In these fish, the swim bladder forms a distinct organ  \nwhich can be readily detached as a discrete entity, and as such is unlikely to be  \ncontaminated with significant quantities of skeletal muscle (fish meat) or other tissue.  \nThe isinglass raw material (swim bladders or ‘fish maws’) are processed under defined \nconditions to produce saleable isinglass in various forms (powder, paste or liquid). The dry \npowder form is typically supplied as a blend containing microbiological stabilizer and acid \nrequired to solubilize the collagen molecules and produce liquid isinglass which is then \napplied in the beer or winemaking process,  \nThe isinglass solution used in brewing consists mainly of solubilized collagen molecules \n(mostly as dimers and trimers with molecular weights of 800-1300kDa) together with \nlesser amounts of gelatine (denatured collagen), low levels of elastin plus low levels (<5% \nconcentration) of other non-collagenous material. Very low levels of material that react in a \ndose-dependent manner in ELISA assay designed to detect Gad c1 parvalbumin (presumed \nto be parvalbumin) have also been identified in isinglass. Unlike many allergens, pepsin \ndigestion studies have demonstrated that isinglass is readily and completely hydrolyzed by \npepsin.   \n  \nIsinglass is used as a clarifying agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage (typically \n15mg/litre; total range 10-60mg/litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it reacts with \nyeast and proteins, forming large flocs. These flocs are removed from the bulk of the liquid \nby filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Residual isinglass levels in treated beers have \nbeen quantified using an ELISA assay developed to detect residual levels of isinglass in beer. \nBeer as presented to consumers will typically contain levels ranging from 0 – 5.0 mg/litre \nmaximum. Brewery-conditioned beers (filtered beers) typically contain less residual \nisinglass than traditional unfiltered British cask beers but results indicate that no types of \nbeer contain more than 5 mg/litre.  \nParvalbumin is not detectable in beer, even when isinglass is dosed at rates which are more \nthan double the highest known commercial rates.  \n  \nAlthough isinglass has been used as a beer clarifying agent for centuries, extensive  \nsearches of the scientific and medical literature have not identified any documented  \ncases of allergic reaction due to isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of  \nallergic reactions to isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all,  \nis extremely rare.   \n  Page 6 of 26 \n \nResults from investigation into parvalbumin levels in isinglass products confirm that  \ncommercial isinglass products may contain parvalbumin at extremely low levels (around 1 \nμg/g on dry weight basis). The manufacturing process for isinglass includes several steps \nthat are designed specifically to minimize levels of residual parvalbumin in commercial \nproducts.  \n \nComprehensive clinical studies on the allergenic potential of isinglass have  \nbeen carried out. Oral challenges have demonstrated no allergic reaction in 21 fish  \nsensitive individuals when challenged with isinglass at very high rates, despite skin  \nprick tests having confirmed that the species of fish used in isinglass production are  \ncapable of inducing allergic response in some fish sensitive individuals. It should also be  \nnoted that since the actual residual amounts of isinglass in commercial beers are  \nvery low, the oral challenge doses equate to extremely high rates of beer consumption  \n(greater in some instances than would be physically possible to consume).   \n  \nBFBi hereby request exemption from the labelling requirements of Section 403(w)(1) of the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass used as a \nfining/clarification aid in beer production on the basis that there is no allergic response \nelicited in fish-allergic individuals consuming beers fined with isinglass, even at \ntheoretically impossible levels of beer consumption. \n2. Applicant   \nThis application is made by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association \n(BFBi). The BFBi, established in 1907, represents the full range of suppliers to the brewing  \nand beverage industries, from raw materials through to process equipment, packaging,  \ndispense and point of sale.  \n \n3. Subject of Petition  \nIsinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen; within the context of this petition \n""isinglass"" is used exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim  \nbladders of the fish rather than from fish skins. Isinglass used in brewing (and wine) is a \npure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders (known in the industry as  \n“maws”) of specific tropical and subtropical fish. Only a restricted range of species  \nare used; these are specific catfish, croakers and threadfins.  Swim bladders are part of the \nbuoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs situated in the dorsal area of the \nbody cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) muscles which make up the fish \n""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the \nfish are processed, these swim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of \nthe fish without extraneous tissue. Thus levels of parvalbumin (the major allergen in fish, \nwhich is associated with fish muscle) would be expected to be low.   \n   \nELISA methods have been developed in order to measure the actual levels of parvalbumin \nin the dried fish maws and in the processed isinglass. Details are provided in Section 6 \n(Analytical data).    Page 7 of 26 \n \n  \nIsinglass used in the brewing industry is prepared from fish maws by a defined series of \nprocesses. The manufacturing process includes a buffer washing stage that is particularly \nefficient at removing the low levels of parvalbumin that might be associated with the raw \nmaterials. The manufacturing process is described in the ‘Code of Good Manufacturing \nPractice for Isinglass’. Details are provided in Section 4 (Manufacturing process).    \n  \nIsinglass has been used for several centuries to clarify beer. At the end of the  \nprimary fermentation beer contains large quantities of yeast and suspended protein  \nsolids which must be removed from the beer. The contribution from yeast is typically  \nin the range 100 to 400 mg/l (dry solids) equivalent to 1x106 to 4x106 cells/ml. Protein  \nparticles contribute a further 150 to 300 mg/l (dry solids).   \n  \nAfter fermentation the beer/yeast mixture is cooled to halt yeast growth. For brewery- \nconditioned beers, isinglass can be added to the beer at this stage. It reacts with the  \nflocculating yeast and protein particles, causing them to sediment rapidly at the base  \nof the storage vessel, so that the majority can be removed prior to filtration. Once the  \nsedimented solids (consisting of isinglass, yeast and protein) are removed, the beer  \ncan then be filtered, typically through a bed of kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth). High  \nspeed centrifugation can replace filtration in certain treated beers. The dosage rate of  \nisinglass is typically 15 mg/litre for brewery-conditioned beers.  \n  \nCask-conditioned beer is a specific style of beer in the UK (sometimes referred to as  \nreal ale) and represents an important traditional product. In this style of beer the yeast \nremains in the cask, and promotes flavour changes that contribute to the essential character \nof the final product. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer before it is transferred to the cask \nor directly into the cask. The action of isinglass takes place generally within the first 3 to 4 \nhours after cask filling so that the flocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) \nrapidly settle to the base of the cask, forming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from \nthe cask at a point above the sediment, so that it remains bright, (i.e. no cloudiness) and free \nof suspended particles. Cloudy beer is not acceptable to the consumer in this type of  \nproduct. (It should be noted that there are other styles of beer which are typically  \ncloudy, for example, wheat beers: however, these are not fined with isinglass).  \nDosage rates for cask-conditioned beers are typically in the range 35-60 mg/litre.   \n   \nSince the added isinglass is removed from the treated beer by either filtration, \ncentrifugation and/or sedimentation, residual levels in the beer as consumed are expected \nto be very low. Investigations into the actual residues of isinglass remaining in beer have  \nbeen carried out, using a highly sensitive antibody-based method. These studies are \ndescribed in Section 6 (Analytical data).   \nAlthough not the subject of this petition, it is noted that the similarities between the \napplication of isinglass in beer and wine, together with scientific studies performed to \nassess the allergenic potential of wine treated with isinglass suggests that it is not likely that \nisinglass-treated wine presents a risk to fish-sensitive wine consumers. (Appendix 12 pp54-\n56)  \n  \n4. Manufacturing process  \n  \nIsinglass is sold in 3 main forms – powder, paste, and pre-dissolved ‘ready to use’  Page 8 of 26 \n \nliquids. Powders are typically pre-blended with dry acid, and often include a source of  \nsulfur dioxide in the form of sodium or potassium metabisulfite. Paste is a hydrated form of \nisinglass, typically 10% w/w isinglass, where the particle size has been reduced to less than \n1 mm. ‘Ready to use’ liquids are dilute acidic solutions of isinglass containing between 0.3 \nand 1.0 % w/w isinglass. Sulfur dioxide is included as a preservative.  \nStudies described in Section 6 (Analytical data) established that the traditional \nmanufacturing process could be adapted to minimize the presence of the common fish \nallergen, parvalbumin, in isinglass.  The new manufacturing process for isinglass (Appendix \n1) was implemented by the isinglass manufacturers in 2007 and the process is outlined \nbelow.   \n• Maws are inspected visually at intake to ensure that they are not discolored, are free \nfrom infestation and are of the specified fish species.   \n• Maws are blended by type to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply criteria.  \n• Maw size is reduced by granulation (to max 25mm) to facilitate subsequent cleaning \nand sterilization.  \n• Granules are sterilized in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution \n• Granules are thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water \n• The sterilized granules are then soaked in a phosphate buffer solution \n• The granules are then thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water  \n• The granules are then dried in a controlled environment with temperature not \nexceeding 400C (1040F) \n \nNote that during the wet processing stages a temperature below 150C (590F)is maintained \nand the temperature of acidified liquid ’ready to use’ isinglass is maintained below 10oC \n(500F). \n  \nThe analytical studies described in Section 6 indicate that low levels of parvalbumin  \ncan be found in fish maws prior to processing, up to a maximum of around 30 µg/g (mg/kg). \nFish species with apparently high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladders are not used in \nisinglass production. \nPhosphate buffer, routinely used in clinical studies to extract parvalbumin from fish flesh \n(Lehrer, 1986), is included in isinglass processing to ensure parvalbumin levels are \nminimized. The levels of residual parvalbumin achievable in commercial isinglass products \nare typically below 1 µg/g (mg/kg), on a dry weight basis.  \nThe detailed industry-agreed Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for isinglass is included \nas Appendix 1.  \n \n5. Documented History of Non-allergenicity  \n  \nComprehensive literature searches in 2004 by Nerac (a specialist data retrieval company)  \nand Dr Steve Taylor of Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP) at the  \nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA)  did not identify any reports of allergic  \nresponses to isinglass or to fish maws (which are widely consumed as a food in their  \nown right amongst Chinese ethnic populations). The searches also failed to find any  \nreports of allergic responses to beer which could be attributed to the use of isinglass  Page 9 of 26 \n \n(of the few reports of allergic responses to beer which were found, most were cereal- \nrelated ; one was related to the proteolytic enzyme papain, two were related to yeast  \nand one was related to an allergy to pollen). Other reports were related to biogenic  \namines, ethanol and ethanol metabolites and sulfites.     \n  \nThis search was repeated in 2007 by Nerac, using the same key words (beer, brewery,  \nallergy, non-allergenic, anaphylactic, hypersensitivity) to identify any reports which  \nmight have been published since 2004. Additional search terms were also used  \n(parvalbumin, isinglass).  Again no reports of allergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish \nsensitive individuals were found. The three papers that mentioned ‘isinglass’ or ‘fish maws’.  \n  \n• Taylor, 2004; was a review article and did not contain any reports of  \nallergic responses to either isinglass or to fish maws.   \n• Chlup, 2006; reported analysis of isinglass residues in  \nbeer. This is discussed in section 6.1 (Isinglass residues in beer).    \n•Phillips, 2003; was a report for a brewing journal of the allergen  \nlabelling Directive 2000/13/EC.  \nFull copies of these articles are included in the References section.    \n \nA paper published after the 2007 search was completed, describes double  \nblind placebo controlled oral challenge trials with wine clarified with protein fining  \nagents (Rolland et al, 2006). The study included 10 fish-allergic patients, who were  \nchallenged with wine fined with isinglass and with un-fined wine as a control. No  \nallergic reactions to the isinglass-fined wine were reported by any of the patients.   \nAn updated literature search was commissioned in 2025 to see if any new reports were \npublished since 2007. The search terms used were the same as previously and the search \nwas conducted by Intertek (a global consultancy firm). Across all sources, no documented \nIgE-mediated allergic reactions were attributed to isinglass in beer (or wine), even among \nfish-allergic individuals.  \n \n \nSummary of Reviewed Studies (July 2025) \nStudy / \nReview \nType Subjects Isinglass \nDetected? \nClinical \nReaction? \nConclusion \nRolland et al. \n(2006) \nDBPCFC + \nBAT \n10 fish-\nallergic \nadults \nNo No Very low risk Page 10 of 26 \n \nKirschner et \nal.

Analytical data  \n  \n6.1 Isinglass residues in beer  \nAs described earlier, residues of isinglass in fined beers are low, since the majority of  \nthe isinglass added is either removed by centrifugation and/or filtration (for brewery-\nconditioned beers) or by sedimentation (for cask-conditioned beers). Analysis of isinglass \nresidues in beer is problematic, not only because of the low levels, but also because of the \npresence of other unrelated proteins. Published studies where beer has not been \nconcentrated prior to analysis have failed to detect any isinglass residues (Chlup, 2006).  \n  \n A method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in isinglass treated beers \ncan be concentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The  \nseparated isinglass can then be hydrolyzed to its constituent acids and quantified by  \nmeasuring the content of hydroxyproline, which is an imino acid present in significant  \nquantities only in animal collagens. The limit of quantification of this method, that is  \nthe concentration of isinglass in beer which can be distinguished from background  \nlevels of hydroxyproline, is 0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry  \nweight basis).   \n  \nThis method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which  \ncould be present in brewery and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine  \nwhether there is likely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn  \nfrom a position close to the bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be  \nmarketable, could nevertheless contain significantly higher concentrations of  \nisinglass.   \n  \nThe results indicate that isinglass residues in many bottled and canned beers fined with  \nisinglass in the brewery are below the limit of quantification of the method. Where  \nisinglass could be quantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed  \n1mg/litre.  \n  \nFor large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were only slightly  \nhigher. Residues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional  Page 12 of 26 \n \nsamples could contain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned (unfiltered) beers, the  \nhighest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  \n  \nThere was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The  \nconcentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above  \nthe level of sedimented material) was marginally higher than in the bulk, but still  \nbelow 5 mg/litre.   \nThe full report of this investigation is included as Appendix 3.   \n \n6.2 Analysis of proteins in source fish, swim bladders, commercial isinglass  \nproducts and beer   \n  \n6.2.1. Extraction methods and SDS analysis of fish and swim bladders (maws)  \n \nThe SDS-PAGE band patterns for extracts of fish used as isinglass sources were  \nsimilar to those of other fish, including cod, and all samples showed a clear band at  \n12 kDa which is characteristic of parvalbumin. Extracts of swim bladders (maws) did  \nnot display this characteristic band. However, the presence of parvalbumin could not  \nbe completely ruled out on the basis of SDS electrophoresis.  \nWestern Blotting was also carried out on extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders  \n(maws) in order to try and confirm the presence or absence of parvalbumin.  \nParvalbumin could be detected in all samples of fish flesh. However, with the swim  \nbladders, traces of parvalbumin could be detected in only one sample.   \n  \nFull details of the experimental methods and results are given in Appendix 4.  \n  \n  \n6.2.2 Residual parvalbumin in swim bladders and in isinglass  \n \n The principal components of isinglass are collagen and elastin, together with  \ndegradation products of collagen, such as gelatine, which are not major fish  \nallergens. Less than 5% of isinglass is non-collagenous material (Hickman et al,  \n2000) (Leach and Barrett, 1967a) (Moir et al, 1984).  There is little adherence  \nbetween the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the fish are processed, these  \nswim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of the fish without  \nextraneous tissue. Thus isinglass would not be expected to contain substantial  \namounts of parvalbumin and no definitive values have been reported in the  \nliterature. ELISA tests for fish parvalbumins (carp and cod) have therefore been  \ndeveloped in order to measure parvalbumin in swim bladders and in commercial samples of  \nisinglass and beer.  \n  Page 13 of 26 \n \nAs a preliminary, an investigation into the homology of fish parvalbumins was carried  \nout by Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP).  This showed a high degree of \nsequence identity, indicating a high likelihood of IgE cross–reactivity. A full report of the \nhomology search is given in Appendix 5.   \n  \nA restricted number of fish species are used in isinglass manufacture, and  \ncommercial products are generally made from a blend of species, chosen to provide  \nthe technological qualities required by the brewer. Preliminary studies on these  \nsource materials were carried out using an inhibition ELISA test based on carp  \nparvalbumin, since the cod parvalbumin ELISA was not yet available. Details of the  \ncarp ELISA are given in Appendix 6. These tests indicated that low levels of  \nparvalbumin could be detected in a range of swim bladders, the starting raw materials for \nisinglass (see Table 1).   \n  \nThese studies also suggested that swim bladders from certain species contained  \nmore parvalbumin than others. Accordingly it was decided that those species with  \nhigher levels of parvalbumin which were not otherwise essential in commercial blends  \nfor functional reasons would no longer be used, and a common list of 6 species was agreed \nby the manufacturers. This species list was incorporated into the Code of Good \nManufacturing Practice described in Section 4.  \n  \nTable 1.

The results (shown in Table 2)  \nindicate that phosphate buffer washing could significantly reduce residual  \nparvalbumin. An alternative approach, washing with calcium solutions, had no effect.  \n \n \n  \nTable 2. Effect of washing on parvalbumin residues in isinglass (laboratory  \nscale)  \nSample Parvalbumin Content (µg/g dry weight, \ncarp equivalents) \nUnwashed isinglass control (3 replicates) 4.6 – 5.0 \nWater wash 3.0 \nPhosphate buffer wash 1.4 \nCalcium solution wash 5.3 \n(Original data – Appendix 6, Table 1.3) \n  \nThese trials were repeated on a production scale, but using isinglass preparations  \nfrom single sources of fish maws in order to compare the extent of reduction. (As noted \npreviously, commercial isinglass products are typically made up of blends from several but \nlimited (see above) fish species). Results (given in Table 3) confirmed that washing with \nphosphate buffer could indeed reduce residual parvalbumin on the commercial scale. \nAlthough not all samples showed a significant reduction, the greatest effects were with \nthose samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin. Since commercial isinglass \nproducts are made from blends of swim bladders from different sources, it appeared likely \nthat phosphate buffer washing, if incorporated into the manufacturing process, could \nsignificantly reduce the range of residual parvalbumin in commercial products.  \n  \n \n \n Page 15 of 26 \n \nTable 3.

The starting material was isinglass \npowder from a typical commercial blend, using the six agreed species. The results (shown in \nTable 4) confirmed that residual parvalbumin can be significantly reduced to around 0.4 \nµg/g on an isinglass dry weight basis, a reduction of approximately 4-fold over the original \nlevel in the raw material.  \n  \nThis processing protocol has subsequently been implemented as a ‘Code of Good \nManufacturing Practice’ by the major isinglass manufacturers, as described in Section 4.   \n  \nTable 4.

The nominal limit of detection of this method is  \n0.20 µg/g. The results, shown in Table 5, suggest that the levels of residual  \nparvalbumin in commercial isinglass products manufactured prior to the introduction of the \nnew manufacturing protocol were in the range <0.2 – 35 µg/g dry weight, but typically less \nthan 10 µg/g.   \n \nTable 5.

For brewery \nconditioned beers in keg, residues did not exceed 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beers, \nthe highest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  \n  \nThe analyses described in Section 6.2.4, Tables 4 & 6, indicated that residual parvalbumin  \nlevels in commercial isinglass products produced using the new protocol described in \nSection 4 would be expected to be less than 1 µg/g. If it is assumed that the parvalbumin in \nisinglass remains associated with it during the fining process, the theoretical maximum for \nresidues of parvalbumin remaining in fined beer would be in the range <0.001 – 0.005 \nµg/litre. This is illustrated in Table 7.   \n  \nThe measurement uncertainty of the cod ELISA is relatively high. If this is taken into  \naccount (i.e. measured value + 3 x Standard Deviation), the concentration of  \nparvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new production protocol could be  \n4 µg/g. This would give a theoretical concentration of parvalbumin of 0.02 µg/litre for  \na “worst case” (i.e. a cask beer with the highest level of isinglass residues detected) .   Page 18 of 26 \n \n These levels of parvalbumin are extremely low and well below the limit of  \ndetermination of the analytical method.   \n  \nTable 7.

In this case  \nparvalbumin residues in beer could potentially be higher. Chemistry theory suggests that \nthis is unlikely, since parvalbumin is not very soluble in acid conditions. The isoelectric \npoint (which is the pH at which it is least soluble) of the main isoform of fish parvalbumin is \ngenerally considered to be around 4.7 (Bugajska-Schretter et al, 2000), with other isoforms \nbeing around 4.4 (Swoboda et al, 2002). Studies of three species of catfish (although not the \nsame species as used for commercial isinglass) found isoelectric points of most isoforms to \nbe in the range 4.5 – 4.8 (Focant, et al, 1999).  Beer pH is typically in the range 4.0 – 4.4.  \n \n  \nThe behavior of parvalbumin during the fining process was investigated on a commercial \nscale, using a 2127 hl beer tank.  Isinglass finings (7.7 kg), prepared using historical \nmanufacturing protocol, were added, equivalent to a typical commercial finings dose of 36 \nmg/litre. Assuming a typical parvalbumin content of 10 µg/g, this would be approximately \n0.36 μg parvalbumin/litre of beer. The sedimented material, which contains isinglass and \nbeer proteins, was collected and tested for parvalbumin. The concentration of parvalbumin \nin the sediment (carp equivalents) was found to be 120 μg/litre, suggesting that \nparvalbumin was significantly concentrated in the beer sediment (which is not consumed) \nrather than partitioning into the bulk of the beer (see Appendix 6A).    \n   \n Page 19 of 26 \n \nFurther experiments were conducted using the cod ELISA in order to determine  \nwhether detectable parvalbumin remained in the beer. A lager and a cask ale were  \nfined using isinglass at typical commercial dose rates (10 mg/litre and 40 mg/litre  \nrespectively), using an isinglass preparation made using the new manufacturing protocol \nwith the same blend of fish species, in the same ratios, as the blend used for the clinical \ntests. The clear beer was freeze dried, which achieved a concentration of approximately 22-\nfold, and the freeze-dried powder tested for parvalbumin using the cod ELISA. The limit of  \ndetection achieved by this procedure was equivalent to approximately 9 µg/litre  \nparvalbumin in beer. No parvalbumin could be detected in either of the two beers.  \n  \n A third beer was dosed with commercial isinglass powder 2 from Manufacturer 1  \n(see Table 5), which contained a relatively high concentration of parvalbumin  \n(7.32 µg/g as detected with the cod ELISA). The dose rate of isinglass in this  \ncase was 156 mg/litre, which is 3-4 times the dose rate typically used for beer and  \ndouble the highest dose rate likely to be used commercially. The clear beer was  \nfreeze dried as before, and the freeze-dried powder analyzed for parvalbumin using the  \ncod ELISA.  As before, no parvalbumin could be detected in the beer. Theoretical  \ncalculation suggested that even this high isinglass dose rate would deliver a  \nconcentration of parvalbumin of not more than 1.14 µg/litre, still below the limit of  \ndetection of the method.   \n(Original data, Appendix. 7, Table 1).   \n   \nA further attempt to determine whether parvalbumin could be detected in  \ncommercially fined beer was carried out using the carp ELISA, which appeared to be  \nslightly more sensitive than the cod-based test.   \n  \n• Two control samples consisted of two commercial brands of beer which had  \nnot been fined with isinglass.   \n• Three trials, consisting of beer which was fined on a commercial scale using  \ntypical dose rates of commercial isinglass pastes   \n  \nThe control and test beers were concentrated by freeze drying in order to achieve a  \nparvalbumin level closer to the lower limit of detection, then analysed for parvalbumin at \nFARRP using the carp ELISA.   The results indicated that the range of “parvalbumin” \ndetected in the test beers, after correction for concentration, was similar to, or indeed lower \nthan, that in the control. Since the control beer contained no animal products whatsoever, \nthis apparent “parvalbumin” must be due to non-specific binding to other components of \nthe beer. Such non-specific binding is known to occur with ELISA-based tests and would in \nthis case be exacerbated by the concentration of the sample. The conclusion is therefore  \nthat the beers fined with isinglass contained no detectable parvalbumin (Appendix 6A, \nPart 2)   \n \n Page 20 of 26 \n \n7. Exposure data  \n  \nThe studies referred to in Section 6 indicate that if present at all, levels of parvalbumin in  \nbeers are below the limit of detection, that is, less than 9 µg/litre. Residual parvalbumin \nresidues in isinglass manufactured according to the old protocol are typically 10μg/g (dry \nweight basis). The new manufacturing protocol reduces potential parvalbumin residues to \nbelow 1µ/g (dry weight basis).    \n  \nSince parvalbumin residues in beer (if present) are too low to measure, potential  \nresidues have been calculated on a theoretical basis. The assumptions used are:  \n  \n• The dose rate of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/litre. This is around the highest  \ndose rate which would be used commercially for cask beers, and is 2-3 times  \nhigher than the rate used for most brewery-conditioned beers.  \n• Residual parvalbumin level in isinglass products manufactured using the old protocol is  \n10μg/g (dry weight basis) cod equivalents.  \n• Residual parvalbumin in commercial products manufactured using the new production \nprotocol is 1 µg/ (dry weight basis).  \n• Parvalbumin co-sediments with isinglass and does not partition into the bulk of  \nthe beer.  \n  \nTable 8 shows the maximum potential exposure to parvalbumin which would be \nexperienced by a person drinking at a moderate rate (1.5 liters of beer in 2 hours) and a \nheavy drinker (3 liters in 2 hours). It can be seen that the greatest exposure, that is, for a \nheavy drinker consuming beer fined with isinglass manufactured as per the old protocol, \nwould be around 0.15 µg parvalbumin in 2 hours. This exposure falls to around 0.015 µg \nwhen isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing Code of Practice is used.   \n  \nTable 8.

Pre-clinical data  \n  \n8.1 Pepsin digestion  \nIt is recognized that allergenic proteins are frequently resistant to digestion in the gut,  \nthus digestibility by pepsin is often used as a parameter for assessing potential  \nallergens. The major fish allergen Gad c 1 is comparatively resistant to pepsin  \ndigestion (Bindslev-Jensen et al., 2003).  \n  \nIsinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, using a similar approach to that  \nwidely used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins  \nconsidered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). Digestibility of peanut  \nallergens was used as a reference. It was found that isinglass was digested  \nsignificantly faster than peanut allergens both at pH 1.2 and pH 2.0. No high  \nmolecular weight material remained after 2 minutes incubation with pepsin at pH 1.2,  \nor 5 minutes at pH 2.0. All low and intermediate molecular weight material was fully  \ndigested at the end of the 60 minute incubation.  Full details of the experimental  \nprocedure and results are given in Appendix 8.    \n  \n  \n9. Clinical (human) data  \n  \n9.1 Preparation of fish extract for clinical studies  \nThe preparation of extracts of fish suitable for use in clinical studies was based on  \nfindings from the protein analyses described in Appendix 4. The extracts were  Page 22 of 26 \n \nchecked for any microbiological contamination as described in Appendix 9.A.  \n  \n \n9.2. Skin prick tests  \n  \n9.2.1 Protocols  \nFARRP have developed protocols for skin prick testing of fish allergic individuals,  \nusing extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders from a range of species used as  \nsource fish for commercial isinglass manufacture. Samples of blood are also taken  \nfrom the individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. The detailed protocols are  \ngiven in Appendix 9.B.  Studies have been carried out at Odense University Hospital in \nDenmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the University of Zurich \nin Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber. \n  \n9.2.2 Results  \nStudies of 8 patients in Denmark were completed. All 8 of the patients reacted to the fish \nflesh, and 7 out of 8 reacted to the swim bladder extracts, suggesting that fish allergic \npatients in Western Europe would be likely to react to the fish species from which isinglass \nis obtained. Detailed results are given in Appendix 9.D.  \n  \n9.3 Oral challenge tests – FARRP protocol  \nFARRP developed standard protocols for double blind placebo controlled  \n(DBPCFC) oral challenge tests, using a commercial sample isinglass (manufactured \naccording to the new protocol) as the challenge material. The detailed protocols are given in \nAppendix 9.C. Isinglass at four dose rates (0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg) was administered over a \ntotal period of 2 hours.  Table 9 shows the amount of beer which these doses of isinglass are \nequivalent to. It is apparent that the cumulative dose over 2 hours substantially  \nexceeds the equivalent volume (50.5 liters) of beer which it is physically possible to drink in \nthat period of time.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Page 23 of 26 \n \nTable 9. Isinglass dose rates in terms of volume of beer  \n  \nIsinglass dose 0.5mg 5mg 15mg 30mg 50.5mg \n(cumulative dose in \n2 hours) \nEquivalent volume of \nbeer at typical \nbrewery conditioned \nbeer (isinglass \nresidues <1mg/liter) \n500ml 5liters 15liters 30liters 50.5liters \nEquivalent volume of \ncask conditioned beer \n(isinglass residues \n<5mg/liter \n100ml 1liter 3liters 6liters 10.1liters \n \nThe isinglass used for the oral challenges was prepared using the new manufacturing \nprotocols. The parvalbumin content as determined by the two ELISA tests was 1.0 µg/g \n(carp parvalbumin equivalents) and 0.695 +/-0.30 µg/g (cod parvalbumin equivalents).    \n  \nOral challenge studies of 15 fish allergic patients were carried out at the same  \ncenters as, and in conjunction with, the skin prick tests, namely, Odense University  \nHospital in Denmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the  \nUniversity of Zurich in Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber.  \nDetails of these studies are reported in Appendix 9.D.   \n \nNone of the patients reacted to the oral challenges with isinglass, even at the very highest \ndoses administered.   \n  \n 9.4 Skin prick tests and oral challenge tests, French protocol  \n \nDouble Blind Placebo Controlled Food challenge trials were also carried out by  \nDr Fabienne Rancé at the Hôpital des Enfants, Allergy and Pneumology, Toulouse,  \nin France, using slightly different protocols. These are shown in Appendix 9.E. The  \noral challenge consisted of a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass, in three doses of 2, 6 and \n12 mg isinglass, at 30 minute intervals over a period of 2 hours. In this case the total dose of \nisinglass was equivalent to at least 4 liters of beer fined at the maximum commercial rate, or \n20 liters of typical brewery conditioned beer. It should be noted however, that these trials \nwere initiated before it was known that isinglass could contain parvalbumin, thus the \nisinglass used in the challenge contained more parvalbumin (a typical level would be up to \n10 µg/g) than that used in the FARRP protocols.   Page 24 of 26 \n \n  \nTests of six patients with fish allergies were completed using these protocols.  \nSkin prick tests with positive and negative controls to confirm allergenicity to fish,  \nwere carried out first. Two out of the six showed positive reactions to the skin prick  \ntests, but there were no positive reactions to the oral challenge tests. (See Appendix  \n9.F).   \n  \n  \n11. Expert Opinion on the allergenicity of isinglass (FARRP)  \n  \nExperts at FARRP (the Food Allergy Research and Resource Programme at the  \nUniversity of Nebraska, USA) were asked to give an expert opinion on the  \nallergenicity of isinglass. This Opinion is included as Appendix 10.  \n  \nIn the view of FARRP, ingestion of isinglass does not present a risk to fish allergic \nindividuals. FARRP consider that the very high doses of isinglass used, together with the \ncomplete lack of allergic reactions, adequately compensate for the fact that the original \ntarget of 29 patients was not achieved (see Appendix 9D).  \n  \nSince the oral challenges were carried out with significant quantities of isinglass itself,  \nand the amount of isinglass remaining in fined beer is extremely small, it follows that  \ndrinking beer fined with isinglass is even less likely to present any hazard to fish-allergic \nindividuals.  \n  \n12. Conclusions  \n  \nUsing the analytical methods described in this report, low but variable amounts  \nof parvalbumin are shown to be associated with commercial isinglass. These levels can be \nsubstantially reduced by limiting the species of source fish used and by simple \nmodifications to the isinglass manufacturing process. Both of these changes have been \nincorporated into a Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, implemented by isinglass \nproducers since 2007.  \n  \nDespite the possible presence of very low levels of parvalbumin in commercial isinglass \nproducts, the potential for parvalbumin to remain in beer is extremely low. The actual \npotential amounts of parvalbumin added to beer during fining (and also to wine, the other \nbeverage where isinglass is commonly used as a fining agent) are extremely small. Both \nchemical theory and the experimental evidence available suggest that parvalbumin co-\nsediments with isinglass and is largely removed from the bulk of the beer. No parvalbumin \ncan be detected in beer, even when the isinglass dose levels are substantially higher than \ntypical commercial rates. Theoretical calculations indicate that even in a worst case Page 25 of 26 \n \nscenario the amount of parvalbumin which could be consumed in a few hours even by a \nheavy drinker of beer is in the order of 0.1-0.2 µg.  \nRepeated literature searches confirm that there have been no published reports of  \nallergic reactions which could be attributed to isinglass or parvalbumin in beer. An oral \nchallenge trial reported in the literature, using wine fined with isinglass, also showed  \nno allergic responses amongst fish-allergic subjects.   \nClinical trials were carried out in order to define the allergenic status of isinglass. These \ntrials included both skin prick tests, using extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders, and oral \nchallenge tests, using isinglass administered at high rates. \nThe doses of isinglass administered are equivalent to extremely high rates of beer \nconsumption. In total twenty-one patients were tested (15 using the FARRP protocol and 6 \nusing the Rancé protocols). No subjects displayed any objective allergic responses on \ningestion of very high levels of isinglass.   \nIn conclusion, the scientific and clinical evidence available indicates that drinking  \nbeer fined with isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in fish sensitive individuals.   \nIt also seems highly likely that the use of isinglass in wine production, which uses the same \nisinglass products as used in beer, with wine being similarly clarified by filtration, is also \nnot very likely to pose a risk of allergic reaction in susceptible individuals \n \nReferences \n  \nBindslev-Jensen, C., Sten, E., Earl, L.K., Crevel, R.W.R., Bindslev-Jensen, U.,  \nHansen, T.K., Stahl-Skov, P and Poulsen, L.K., 2003, Food Chem Toxicol., 41, 81- \n87.

FEVS's \nmembership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with \nexports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for \nFrench wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). \n \nFEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American \nconsumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and \nquality of the wines and spirits they purchase. \n \nTherefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on the TTB’s proposed rulemaking. \n \n \nOn allergen labelling for distilled spirits \n \nFEVS warmly welcomes the proposed approach taken by TTB not to require allergen labelling for distilled \nspirits. This rightly acknowledges the fact that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in a product which \nhas been going through a distillation process. It also ensures coherence with the approach already adopted \nby TTB regarding the gluten-free labelling of distilled products. \n \n \nOn processing aids and fining agents \n \nFEVS appreciates the possibility for isinglass and fish gelatin, which could be used as fining agents in the \nwine production process, to only label “fish” as the name of the allergen, without being required to indicate \nthe fish species used to make the product. \n \nNevertheless, FEVS would like to share concerns about the proposal made by TTB to require the disclosure \nof processing aids derived from major food allergens on label . As rightly pointed out in the Notice,  this \nproposal should negatively impact wine products since albumen, isinglass or casein are usually used as fining \nand/or clarifying agents for wines. \n \n2 \nAll of the nine substances considered as “major food allergen” under TTB proposed Notice (with the \nexception of soybean which  is subject to lesser standards ) are part of a list of food or ingredients which, \naccording to Codex Alimentarius 1, “shall always be declared as allergenic food using the specified name in \naddition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food” (bold added). \n \nThis has to be read in conjunction with the Codex definition of a processing aid\n2 which is “ a substance or \nmaterial, not including apparatus or utensils, and not consumed as a food ingredient by itself, intentionally \nused in the processing of raw materials, foods or its ingredients, to fulfil a certain technological purpose during \ntreatment or processing and which may result in the non‐intentional but unavoidable presence of residues \nor derivatives in the final product” (bold added). \n \nIn addition, most of the operators using fining or clarifying agents  proceed to filtration of their wine before \nbottling to ensure the limpidity of the product as well as the complete removal of any allergenic substance, \nin line with good manufacturing practices. \n \nWhile acknowledging the necessity to rightly inform consumers on the presence of all allergens derived from \nmajor food allergens in the final product, FEVS kindly requests TTB not to require the labelling of processing \naid when producers have followed good manufacturing practices and/or international standards relating to \nthe management of allergen in the food production process, such as the Codex Alimentarius Code of practice \non food allergen management for food business operators (see here) or the OIV Code of good fining practices \nfor wine to be applied in the use of proteinaceous wine fining agents with allergenic potential (casein and egg \nwhite) (see here). \n \nAdopting a diverging approach from international standards could lead to the creation of access market \nbarriers, not only for foreign operators willing to export their products to the US but also for US producers \nexporting their wines to foreign markets. For instance, according to EU harmonized rules, all food products, \nincluding alcoholic beverages, put on the EU market have to indicate  “any ingredient or processing aid (…) \nused in the manufacture or preparation of a food and still present in the finished product, even if in an altered \nform”\n3 (bold added). \n \n \nOn the wording of the labeling statement and other mandatory disclosures \n \nFEVS encourages TTB to require the use of the terms “ Contains” (followed by a colon and the name of the \nfood source from which each major food allergen is derived) rather than “Contains Major Food Allergens”. \n \nAs long as only some allergens would fall under a compulsory requirement of disclosure for alcoholic \nbeverages, FEVS does not consider such indication would be confusing or misleading for US consumers. \n \nOn the contrary, adopting the terms “ Contains” would increase the legibility  and understandability of the \nalcoholic beverages label for US consumers by using  the same terms as those already required  for other \nhealth-sensitive ingredients (FD&C Yellow No.5, carmine…) when used in spirits or wine products , including \nallergen like sulfites which is present and labelled in the overwhelming majority of wines sold on the US \nmarket. \n \nThis approach would also build on consumers’ habits and purchasing behaviors by ensuring consistency with: \n- current commercial practices used by alcoholic beverages operators who voluntarily label major food \nallergens according to the 2006 TTB Interim rules, \n- alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA and FALCPA rules, \n- other food products sold on the US market. \n \n1 See Point 4.2.1.4 of the General Standard for the labelling of pre -packaged foods CXS 1 -1985: “4.2.1.4 The following foods and \ningredients are known to trigger food allergy or coeliac disease and shall always be declared as allergenic foods using the specified \nname in addition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food:” \n2 See Point 2 « Deﬁnitions » of the General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods CXS 1-1985 \n3 See article 9.1 (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers 3 \nIn addition, requiring the use of the terms “ Contains” will guarantee the alignment of US rules for alcoholic \nbeverages with international standards applying to all food products, as agreed in the 2024 revised Codex \nAlimentarius General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods4. \n \nThis would be of great importance, for economic operators as well as US consumers, considering the growing \nnumber of countries across the world which require to label either the full list of ingredients (as it is the case \nin the EU for wine products) or, at least, allergens on alcoholic beverages packaging  (as it is the case in the \nEU for all alcoholic beverages). \n \nFor the same reason, and in line with our preference for using the terms “Contains”, FEVS would welcome \nthe possibility for operators to choose how to label major food allergen s on their packaging either by a \nspecific “Contains” statement or by their inclusion within a list of ingredients . This will allow operators to \nrightly inform consumers without having to change their packaging whatever the TTB will ultimately decide \nregarding ingredient listing for alcoholic beverages (see Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237 ), but also \nwhen providing the list of ingredients on a voluntary basis according to US currently applying rules. \n \nIt's also the reason why FEVS requests TTB not to mandate specific placement, type size or presentation \nrequirements for the indication of major food allergens beyond what it is already required for the sulfites \nstatement. This should include the possibility for operators either to make two separate statements (one for \nthe food major allergen, the other one for sulfites) or to gather all of them  in one single statement, as long \nas legibility requirements are fulfilled.  \n \nAll the above elements will also enable operators to manage the limited space available on label to include \nsuch requirements, while ensuring clear, not misleading and accurate information to US consumers. \n \n \nOn the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations \n \nFEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion of a statement of major food allergens. \n \nIn addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to \nput on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force \nof any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. \n \nLast but not least, if TTB decides to adopt a final rule on Alcohol Fact Statements for alcoholic beverage (as \nenvisaged in Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237), FEVS ask s for an identical date of entry into force \nfor both regulations. This will prevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost \nthis approach could have for them, especially considering the overwhelming majority of SMEs in the sector. \n \n \n4 See Point  8.3.2.1 of the General Standard for the labelling of pre- packaged foods CXS 1 -1985: “ 8.3.2.1 If used, the separate \nstatement shall commence with the word ‘contains’ (or equivalent word) and be placed directly under or in close proximity to the \nlist of ingredients when present” ""}]",TTB-2025-0003-0183,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-12 16:54:02,,False,Comment 178:  Fédération des Exportateurs de Vins & Spiritueux de France (FEVS),09000064b8ef6289,2025-08-12 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,"Please, find enclosed comments on behalf on the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration des Exportateurs de Vins &amp; Spiritueux de France (FEVS)",me7-5xwk-h7jy,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-08-11 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:17,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required \nwhen the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify \nwines and beers. \nAt a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the \nexposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert \nCommittee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the \nEuropean Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an \nestablished history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the \nreference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of \nexposure for derivative safety assessment. \nThe EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or \nfish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen \nlabelling. \nAs regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled \nSpirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, \nthe EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines \non the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-\n2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars \nincluded in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  \nsuch as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to \nhighlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory \nindication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, \ncontrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated \non traded alcoholic beverages. \nFinally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed \n5-years.

The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits\nproducers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and\nits membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on\npotential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.\nWhile the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two\nnotices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit\ncomments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise\nsimilar concerns for Kentucky\'s spirits industry. Please accept the following as the\nKDA\'s comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket\nTTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to\nrequire the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of\ndistilled spirits.\nSince the KDA\'s founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and\nresponsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky\'s signature Bourbon and Distilled\nSpirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world\'s\nsupply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As\nsuch, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and\nadministrative impact on our members.\nLaw Offices: Lexington I Louisville I Frankfort\nGovennment Affains: Frankfont\nmcbnayenf inm.comMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 2\n1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers\nThe KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs\nassociated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft\nproducers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to\ndistilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff\nand capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be\nan expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping\nunits (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued\ntesting would be cost prohibitive.\nIt is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated\nto be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits\nlabels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic\nand logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive\npackaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real\nestate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them\nignore key labeling information altogether.\n2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion\nThe proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces\nredundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by\nvolume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the\nrequirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further\nby requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,\nwhich will result in customer confusion.\nCustomers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being\nquantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on\nthe Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of\nalcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or\nmisinterpret the label entirely.\nFurther, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes\nproteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed\nAlcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in\nthe product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer\nwould reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that\nthere are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.\ntMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 3\nThe KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due\nto the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.\n3. Digital Labeling Options\nSpirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As\ndiscussed, to keep consumers\' attention and give them the ability to learn more about\ncertain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such\nan approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy\n\'click through\' for the latest and more in-depth product information.\nMoreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for\nprinting new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant\nenvironmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost\nninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for\nhelping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less\nenvironmental effects.\n4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process\nAs TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -\nincluding gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a\nproper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled\nspirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the\nexception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled\nspirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced\npost-distillation.\nThe KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption\nregarding TTB\'s testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-\ncase basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself\nby requiring lab analysis of every product.\nIf the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final\nrulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due\nto the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation\nproduct. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause\ntremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be\n\'gluten-free\' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about\ngluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill\ninformation or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.\nIncluding more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 4\npotential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential\ncustomers.\n5. Conclusion\nAs TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to\nconsider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations\nthat consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and\nother spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are\nalready well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing\nmore than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing\ninefficiencies.\nSincerely,\nRRIS\nTNM\n4904-9883-6316, v. 1'}]",TTB-2025-0003-0182,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-11 17:02:31,,False,Comment 177:  Kentucky Distillers' Association,09000064b8ef65d2,2025-08-11 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,See attached comments on behalf of the Kentucky Distillers&#39; Association.

Comments on “Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt \nBeverages” \n \nspiritsEUROPE very much welcomes the approach taken by TTB on allergens labelling for distilled \nspirits. As the Notice rightly points out, the production of spirits involves the distillation of raw \nmaterials in such a way that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the distilled product or \ndistilled ingredient. It is therefore appropriate that the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply \nto major food allergens used before the distillation process. \n \nWe also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing protein are added \nto the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food allergens are listed on the label. \n \nFor those products where the presence of allergens would have to be disclosed , spiritsEUROPE  \nwelcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. In addition, we  would like to request the \npossibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before the proposed \nrule comes into effect. \n \nFinally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking  Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts \nStatements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into \nforce is aligned with that of  Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages. \n '}]",TTB-2025-0003-0184,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-12 16:57:19,,False,Comment 179:  spiritsEUROPE,09000064b8ef6027,2025-08-12 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,"spiritsEUROPE represents the interests of the European distilled spirits industry.

The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses\nThat Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust\n\nCensus Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that\nsmall businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the\nbeer, wine, and spirits industry:\n\nLine of Number of Firms That Had\n\nBusiness Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage\nBreweries 3,214 2,609 81%\nWineries 3,576 2,975 83%\nDistilleries 760 659 86%\n\nIn the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and\nSpirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than\n6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.\nThe report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the\nnumber of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has\n\n2 90 Fed.

The Biden-proposed rules would impose\nunaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive\nbarrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in\nthe industry who can.\n\nThe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\nfail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared\nthat “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities\nhas in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,\n\n4 Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022), p.\n8.\n\n5 Indeed, the Department of the Treasury admitted, in explaining the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling\nRule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at\n5775, col. 2.\n\n§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,\nsale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,\ndiffering views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and\nconsumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,\nmoral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these\nquestions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and\nspirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound\nscience and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.\nNFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits\nhave available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage\nenvironments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out\nto Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-\nalcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the\nguidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at\nhttps:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-\n2025.pdf (visited July 25, 2025).\n\n7 Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 note.\ndiscouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress\nalso noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated\nbusinesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to\ninefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some\ncases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental\nand economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules\nsimply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately\ndismisses it.®\n\nPresident Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the\ncountry’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:\n\nMy Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built\non common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators\nfirst. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade\npractices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°\n\nTo help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting\nred tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen\nLabeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\n2. TTB Did Not Get the President\'s Deregula’ Message\n\nPresident Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they\nshould seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days\nafter TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule\nand the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order\n14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The\never-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on\nthe lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic\ngrowth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He\nalso said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private\n\n8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB\nconsidered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is\nnot proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of\nthe proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who\nare allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a\npermanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage\nlabels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such\nproducts.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all\npseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to\ncombat.\n\n® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).\nexpenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic\nprosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”\nHe emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate\nunnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°\n\nOn February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring\nLawful Governance and Implementing the President\'s ‘Department of Government\nEfficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should\nidentify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that\nimpose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”\nand “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private\nenterprise and entrepreneurship.”*\'\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-\nCompetitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not\npredetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that\nreduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they\ncreate for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed\nagency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...\ndistortions on the operation of a free market.”!2\n\nThese are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though\nimproperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive\nSuggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,\nissued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.\n\nTo comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the\nquoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-\nproposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the\nDepartment of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to\nthe specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head\nof TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that\nunreasonably burden small and other businesses.\n\n1° Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (January 31, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg.\n9065 (February 6, 2025), sections 1 and 2.\n\n11 Executive Order 14219, Ensuring Lawful Governance and implementing the President\'s “Department of\nGovernment Efficiency” Deregulatory Initiative (February 19, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 10583 (February 25,\n2025), section 2.\n\n12 Executive Order 14267, Reducing Anti-Competitive Barriers (April 9, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 15629 (April\n15, 2025), sections 1 and 3.\n3. These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record\n\nTTB says\'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a\nrecommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in\nthe Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits \'4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a\nFebruary 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)\'®\njoined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or\ntogether, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-\nproposed rules.\n\nRegarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes\'® the Executive Summary at\nthe front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that\ncould serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,\nsuch as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been\nimplemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB\nshould revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory\ninformation on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In\nbetween the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the\nreport, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the\nrecommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by\ncommenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report\nrecommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the\nrecommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient\nlabeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was\ntherefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen\n\n13 90 Fed, Reg. at 5763, cols. 2 and 3, and 6554, cols. 2 and 3.\n‘4 Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022).\n\n8 Available at https:/Avww.cspi.org/sites/default/files/2022-\n03/Letter%20requesting%20leadership%200n%20improving%20alcohol%20labeling%20to%20protect%2\nOpublic%20health. pdf (visited July 25, 2025).\n\n‘6 in the preamble of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, 90 Fed.

The count of five paragraphs does not include a purported sixth paragraph numbered\n4.4.6.2 that is referenced in one of the five paragraphs, because there is actually no paragraph numbered\n4.4.6.2 in the Treasury Competition Report.\nLabeling Rule that TTB’s decision to revisit an Allergen Labeling Rule was “[cjonsistent\nwith the Competition Report\'s recommendations[.]’2°\n\nThe CSPI letter of February 24, 2021, represented the view of seven organizations that\nexist to advocate particular views, in this case not favorable to the beer, wine, and\nspirits industry: CSPI, Alcohol Justice, American Institute for Cancer Research,\nConsumer Federation of America, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, National\nConsumers League, and U.S. Aicohol Policy Alliance. Advocacy to the federal and\nstate governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by\nthe First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state\nconstitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a\ncomplete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.\n\n4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails\nLegal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue\nthe rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the\nbenefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to\nimpose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal\nAlcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by\nthe beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,\nmisleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,\nobscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only\n\n20 90 Fed. Reg. at 5763, col. 3.\n\n21 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has\nno power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until\nCongress confers power upon it.”); NFIB v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)\n(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that\nCongress has provided."").\n\n2 27 U.S.C. 205(e). The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of\ntitle 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.\n205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,\nto provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the\nproduct, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the\nauthority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,\nanalyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the\ncase of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the\nState into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at\n5764, col. 1.\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major\nallergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep\n(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things\nthat are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or\nimporter -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,\napplying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that\nCongress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”\nunless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen\nlabeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue\nthe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains\nMajor Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in\nfact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that\nTTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits\nwith its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech\nthat is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,\ndistilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in\nthe production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major\nallergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the\nallergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility\nin exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if\nthe allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°\nIf an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but\n\n23 The U.S, beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (Source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-1 92dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf), and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM. pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market (all sources visited July 25, 2025).\n\n24 The proposal requires labeling for any of nine major food allergens: milk, egg, fish, Crustacean\nshellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. 90 Fed.

To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:\n\n... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the\ncost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry\nmembers would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the\nAlcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new\nallergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just\none label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°\n\nThe TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business\nassuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling\nRule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal\nduty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and\nmust consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°\nTTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes\nof the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a\nfinal Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not\nan Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,\nbut not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to\ncomply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603\n\n27 See TTB discussion of using “scientifically valid analytical methods’ to verify the absence of proteins in\nfinal products. 90 Fed.

Cir. 2004); McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v.\n\nThomas, 838 F. 2d 1317, 1323 (D.C. Cir. 1988).”).\n10\n\nof title 5 of the U.S. Code and the analysis and consideration of costs and benefits\nrequired by Executive Order 12866, as amended.*\'\n\nGiven the serious shortcomings of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, the\nTreasury Department should withdraw the proposed rule.\n\n5. The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails\nLegal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the\nrule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and\nExecutive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by\nlaw.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury\nDepartment claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)\nchapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)\nsection 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant\nthe authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration\nproposed.\n\nOf the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only\nthree provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)\nREQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the\nrevenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits\nissued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,\nsale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5\nwine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section\n5368 provides:\n\n(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and\ngauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such\nmanner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\n31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).\n\n22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has\nno power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until\nCongress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)\n(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that\nCongress has provided."").\n\n33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.\n1\n\n(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,\nvehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with\nthis chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\nSection 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or\nsale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled\nin such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be\nremoved from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled\nspirits plants under section 5222.”\n\nThe three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.\nSection 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for\ndistilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.\nSection 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the\ncomparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different\nfrom marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to\nimpose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of\nlabeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also\nthat the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to\nlabeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by\nvolume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412\ngrants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.\nAccordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue\nCode to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or\nbeer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.\n\nThe Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal\nAlcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by\nthe beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,\nmisleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,\nobscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol\nFacts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\n\n34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in\none section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).\n12\n\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the\nrequirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,\nalcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.\nAlso, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes\nthat Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic\nsignificance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant\nalcohol facts labeling authority.\n\nThe Treasury Department\'s triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for\nScience in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2\n(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which\nit can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide\nconsumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.\nCircuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional\npredecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,\nthere is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates\nCongress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient\ndisclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of\ndiscretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,\nas necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with\nthat congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the\nagency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,\n104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme\nCourt rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which\nthe Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its\n\n3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were\ndefined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to\nauthorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.\n\n36 The U.S. beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-192dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf}, and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM.pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market.\n\n37 90 Fed. Reg. at 6655, col. 3.\n\n38 Center for Science in the Public interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2 (D.C.\nCir. 1986).\n13\n\nmeaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their\nindependent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory\nauthority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9\n\nSo, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that\nleaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.\nCongress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when\nit wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the\nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little\nbenefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost\nthe industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement\n(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent\nyears for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has\nno reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to\npurchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without\nadmitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them\nto purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling\nrequirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they\notherwise would have faced.\n\nAs for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of\nalcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to\nquantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in\nthe absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”\nassuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.\nIn the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule:\n\nTTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but\nas stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide\nconsumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of\nalcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice\n\n38 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024).\n4 24 U.S.C. 343(q).\n\n41 90 Fed.

Reg. at 6684, col 2.\n14\n\nabout moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional\ninformation about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.\n\nThe first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\n“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a\nthread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts\nlabeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would\nmean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but\ncarbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.\nAlso, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery\nstore), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in\na bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it\nmight be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts\nlabel diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with\nrespect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the\nAlcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to\ncompare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a\nhigher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should\ntake human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on\nassumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\nThe second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\nprovide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient\ncontent of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the\nproposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing\nthe additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the\nlabeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the\nlabeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\ngreatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.\n\nThirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-\nproposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”\n\n4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information\nrequirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per\ncontainer, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.\n\n48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of\nlegal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in\na day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better\nfor health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who\nare pregnant.”).\n\n47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or\nany other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United\n15\n\nTTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5\n“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And\nimmediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,\nwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\nBut that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to\nthe proposed rules.\n\nn\n\nThe data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises\n(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in\nthis case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the\nproposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account\nof recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is\n$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298\nper year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the\nBiden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making\nabout $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed\ncharge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.\n\nParticularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its\ndecision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities:\n\nThe production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an\nindustry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and\nadvertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding\nmore elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant\nimpact on the regulated industry.°!\n\nThe TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding\nmore labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential\npolicy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.\n\nkkKEK\n\nStates, the agency shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis.”\n\n48 90 Fed.

In the final rule, TTB should shorten the compliance period from 5 years to 3.5 years to prevent further delay of consumer access to this basic safety information.<br/>In summary. please label alcoholic products with information about possible food allergens to protect public health.<br/>Thank you for your consideration to this important topic.<br/>",me1-st7v-lhjz,,Comment(s),0,,,Temple Terrace,FL,,United States,,Ellen,Snelling,,,,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,0,2025-08-12 21:42:20,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA. We are dedicated to advancing evidence-based policies that promote public health and safety. We are writing in response to the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)’s request for comment on rulemaking around allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages (27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7; Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238).  We applaud TTB’s intention to improve the transparency and safety around alcoholic beverages. As a consumable product, alcohol is often unaccountably exempt from the consumer information requirements of other foods and beverages. This proposed rulemaking will close the gap.  Food allergies are not a rare condition. Approximately 11% of U.S. adults are estimated to have a food allergy (around 26 million), and 38.3% of those individuals have had an allergy-related emergency department visit.1 Of those with a food allergy, 90% are allergic to one of 9 major food types.2 Alcohol use is common in the United States, with 177.3 million residents ages 12 and up consuming alcohol in the past year. Depending on the nature of the alcohol product, many will very often contain one or more of the 9 major allergens (e.g., the grains used to make beer almost inevitably introduce wheat gluten to the finished product), while for others the presence of an allergen can be difficult to know for certain (e.g., distilled spirits) and in some cases un-anticipatable (e.g. the use of fish-derived products in wine production). Allergic events create a steady financial drain. In a systematic review of allergen economic impact studies, individual medical costs from allergen-related causes amount to an average of $2,081 per event, while household costs exceed an average of $8000 per event from out-of-pocket expenses and opportunity costs.3 As such, avoiding unexpected exposures to allergens in alcohol consumption could have a significant health and economic benefit to U.S. households.  To be most effective in addressing these concerns, the TTB rulemaking should err on the side of consistency across labels. That means minimizing the alternatives to the “Contains major food \nallergens” wording, even if said alternative wording is considered by the producer to be more emphatic. Consumers become accustomed to looking for allergen information in particular places with particular words. Along these same lines, the “minor” allergens should be consistently identified in the same place and same formatting as major ones. The warning should be high-visibility, including a minimum font size, restrictions on kerning and compressing, a mandated box, and contrasting background within that box.  We would advise against allowing allergen labeling exemptions for distilled products, because cross-contamination is a known and described phenomenon across food production. TTB could consider a warning akin to the “made in a facility that also processes” language commonly used in food product warnings, however it’s not clear that this complexity actually does producers a favor. It is less impactful to err towards an unnecessary label than to induce a medical event.  On-label warnings are an absolute requirement. QR codes are not universally sought out or employed, and the required access to the internet is not always available.4 Moreover, not all packaged alcohol will be consumed in circumstances where the consumer will be expected to have mobile device with them. Allergen information should be as available beachside as it is in the grocery store, and the only way to ensure this is to include the information directly on the packaging.   As a final note—we join with the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and other groups in urging TTB to require full ingredient labeling for all products. While the allergen warnings are important to prevent acute medical events, there are many other reasons to avoid or seek out certain ingredients, including ethical and religious grounds. We also support CSPI’s request for an accelerated, 3.5–year timeline—the concerns from industry in ramping up the testing for products should be offset by the acclimation time required by the public to begin reflexively seeking allergen information on the labels.   We thank TTB for their long-term effort in developing and promulgating these new guidelines. Alcohol Justice is available at the Bureau’s request for any further information or context to help bring this rulemaking to fruition.

As an organization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US \nunderstands the importance of leveraging data and technology to improve transparency and \nenhance consumer access to detailed product information that supports informed decision making. \nWe commend TTB’s commitment to these goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute \nour insights. \n \nFor over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver \nsafe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC \nbarcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners \nidentify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions \nof businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 \nmembers across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage \nproduction, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. \n \nAs a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify \nindustry challenges and to build consensus on best practices for solving them using global \nstandards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global \nstandards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards \nhelp empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access \nto the information they want and need about those products. \n \n2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Allergen Labeling \nGS1 US acknowledges the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with \nessential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, \nparticularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid \nin achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as UPC barcodes, can only hold a limited \namount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of \nstoring much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates,  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  2 \nand more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing comprehensive \ninformation in a compact format. \n \nThe food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and consumer value of \ndigital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform launched in 2015 to \nprovide detailed product information via QR codes. Incorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global \nTrade Item Number (GTIN) can effectively support consumer access to allergen information. This \napproach promotes consumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. \nAdditionally, 2D barcodes can serve as a valuable complement to the information required to \nappear on the physical label.  Besides the required on-pack disclosures, 2D barcodes provide a \npathway to more detailed information, such as ingredient lists, sustainability practices, and \nresponsible consumption messaging, enhancing transparency for consumers. \n \nA GS1 Digital Link-enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and \nallergen information, including dynamic data including recalls or safety alerts, through a simple \nsmartphone scan. The GS1 Digital Link standard enhances the power and flexibility of GS1 \nidentifiers by integrating them into the web. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into \ngateways to consumer information, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand \nloyalty while improving supply chain traceability. \n \nMoreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up label space. \nQR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater capacity for \ninformation. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing comprehensive data. \nFurthermore, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already familiar with \nscanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American adults use \nsmartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said they would scan a QR code to access \nproduct information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers consumers to \neasily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. \n \nIn addition to enhancing consumer access to product and allergen information, 2D barcodes \nencoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and interoperable format, ensuring accuracy \nand consistency across retail and digital platforms. Including the GTIN in a QR code encoded with \nGS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product information.  \n \nApplication of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information \nGS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification \nand efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open, global standards can \nsignificantly enhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be \napplied to support industry compliance with allergen labeling requirements: \n \n1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, \nparties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the \nmanufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to \nrecognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information.  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  3 \n2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies \nsuch as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical \ninformation like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate \ncapture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. \n3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data \nformats allows for seamless information exchange across the supply chain. This \ntransparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their \nconfidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by \nfacilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. \n \nConclusion \nIncorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN for product identification, 2D barcodes, and \nGS1 Digital Link into the TTB’s allergen labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance \nconsumer access to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only enable industry \nstakeholders to efficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future \nadvancements in the digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively \nwith TTB, industry partners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of \nthis important initiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the \nopportunity to contribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol \nbeverage products. \n \n \nSincerely,\u202f\u202f  \n\u202f  \nMaggie Lyons  \nVice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs  \n ""}]",TTB-2025-0003-0190,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-14 19:11:28,,False,Comment 185:  GS1 US,09000064b8efb399,2025-08-14 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,GS1 US Comments on TTB Proposed Rule - Major Allergen Labeling,mea-4t82-9lcw,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-08-13 04:00:00,1,2025-08-15 13:38:33,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

Many individuals, including those with visual impairments, older consumers, and those with limited literacy skills, struggle to read small print on product labels. Clear and legible allergen notifications are essential for ensuring that all consumers can easily identify potential allergens and make informed decisions about the products they consume. For individuals with food allergies, the ability to quickly and accurately read allergen information can be a matter of life and death. Ingesting an allergen due to unreadable labeling can lead to severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Therefore, it is imperative that allergen notifications be presented in a font size that is easily readable by all consumers. To respond to a specific question posed by the TTB regarding the format of allergen notifications, I propose that the phrase “Contains:” followed by the potential allergen(s) is sufficient to convey the needed information. This succinct approach avoids unnecessary elaboration or wordiness, ensuring the label remains clear and easy to understand. There is no need to prominently state ""Major Food Allergen"" or similar terms on the label. Consumers concerned about particular allergens only need to see the specific allergen identified, and this will adequately serve the cautionary purpose. To enhance the readability of allergen notifications, I recommend that the TTB establish a minimum font size of at least 10 points for allergen declarations. (This is equivalent to a size of approximately 3.53 millimeters.) This recommendation aligns with best practices in labeling and ensures that the critical information is accessible to a broad audience. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have established minimum font size requirements for  2 \nimportant label information to ensure readability. Adopting a similar approach for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels would be consistent with these established practices and promote consumer safety. Studies have shown that larger font sizes significantly improve readability and comprehension of label information. According to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), increasing font size on medication labels improved patient understanding and compliance. Additionally, organizations advocating for individuals with food allergies and visual impairments have consistently highlighted the importance of readable labeling. Groups including the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) and the American Council of the Blind (ACB) have called for larger font sizes to ensure that critical health information is accessible to all consumers. Establishing a minimum font size for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels is a necessary and logical step to enhance consumer safety and accessibility.

AAFA is the leading \npatient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma \nand allergy patient group in the world.  We are dedicated to improving the quality of \nlife for people with allergic diseases and asthma through education, advocacy and \nresearch.   \nAAFA strongly supports the proposal to mandate major allergen labeling on the \nalcoholic beverages under the Bureau’s jurisdiction.  Our position, and responses to \nsome of the specific questions posed by the Bureau, are detailed below. \nThe importance of mandatory major allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages \nMany consumers of alcoholic beverages have food allergies.  Over 10 percent of \nadults in the United States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have \nexperienced at least one food-allergy-related emergency department visit.1  \nExposure to an allergen can trigger reactions ranging from mild symptoms like \nisolated hives to a more severe, multi-system reaction called anaphylaxis, which is \npotentially life-threatening. \n \n1 Gupta R, Warren C, Smith B, Jiang J, Blumenstock J, Davis M, Schleimer R, Nadeau K.  Prevalence \nand Severity of Food Allergies Among US Adults.  JAMA Open Network. 2019; 2: e185630  \n1400 Crystal Drive • Suite 660 • Arlington, VA 22202 • 202-466-7643 • 800-7-ASTHMA • aafa.org \n \n2 \nConcerns about allergens in alcoholic beverages are not theoretical.  Wines, distilled \nspirits and beers can contain undisclosed allergens, either used as processing agents \nor as ingredients.2  For example, wine may contain residue from egg albumen, casein \n(milk protein), chitin (fiber from crustacean shells), fish oil, gelatin (protein from \nboiling animal parts) and isinglass (gelatin from fish bladder membranes).\n3 \nConsuming these particles in wine can trigger reactions for people allergic to these \nfoods.4  Craft beers and liqueurs can also contain allergenic ingredients.   \nTo prevent a reaction, people with allergies must avoid foods and beverages \ncontaining their allergen.  For over two decades, the Food Allergen Labeling and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) has required major allergen labeling for \nFDA-regulated foods and beverages, making it far easier for people navigating food \nallergies to stay healthy.  FALCPA applies to the “top nine” allergens – milk, egg, fish, \ncrustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.   \nAlcoholic beverages do not fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction.  However, when FALCPA \nwas enacted, a House committee report noted that the committee expected the Tax \nand Trade Bureau to develop allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages.\n5  As the \npreamble details, TTB has taken a long route to reaching the current proposal, and \nwe strongly support its finally being enacted.  Mandatory labeling is crucial to provide \nconsistent, reliable information to consumers. \n \n2 Deckwart M, Carstens C, Webber‐Witt M, Schäfer V, Eichhorn L, Schröter F, Fischer M, Brockow K, \nChristmann M, Paschke‐Kratzin A. 2014b.

Available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/108th-congress/house-report/608.  “The \nCommittee expects, consistent with the November 30, 1987 Memorandum of Understanding, that \nthe Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the Department of Treasury will pursuant \nto the Federal Alcohol Administration Act determine how, as appropriate, to apply allergen labeling \nof beverage alcohol products and the labeling requirements for those products. The Committee \nexpects that the TTB and the FDA will work together in promulgation of allergen regulations, with \nrespect to those products.”  \n1400 Crystal Drive • Suite 660 • Arlington, VA 22202 • 202-466-7643 • 800-7-ASTHMA • aafa.org \n \n3 \nWhile not directly addressed by this proposed rule, AAFA also strongly supports the \nmandatory inclusion of an ingredient list for alcoholic beverages.  Many people have \nallergies to foods that are not in the “top nine,” and need to know when their allergens \nare present in a food or drink.  In addition, this basic requirement would simply bring \nalcoholic beverages in line with what consumers are entitled to know about the \ningredients of their FDA-regulated foods.  Similarly, to ensure the health and nutrition \nof all consumers, AAFA believes information on nutrition and serving sizes should be \nrequired on labels.  This would allow consumers to assess both their intake of alcohol, \nto stay within recommended safety guidelines,6 and their overall consumption of \ncalories from alcoholic beverages,7,8 helping address obesity and related disease.  \n \nWording and Placement of the Labeling Statement \nAs noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, in our 2024 comments AAFA \nencouraged TTB to hew as closely as possible to allergen labeling on FDA-regulated \nfoods.9  Consumers with food allergies are familiar with FDA labeling, and would be \nable to most easily transition to a model that looks similar. \nWe understand that this proposed rule does not address full ingredient listing \nrequirements, and that the presence or absence of such a requirement could \ninfluence the allergen labeling.  Therefore: \n- If there is no full ingredient labeling requirement, AAFA supports TTB’s proposal \nto require “Contains Major Food Allergens:” followed by the relevant food \n \n6 U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

We do not \nsupport the inclusion of allergens in a voluntary ingredients statement \nbecause this would create inconsistency across products for consumers.  \nOther ingredients (such as sulfites) should be listed in a statement that is \nseparate from the “Contains Major Allergens” statement. \n \n- In the context of full ingredients listing, we would support TTB echoing the FDA’s \nrequirements for major allergen labeling (permitting inclusion of allergens in \nthe ingredients list or in a Contains statement). \n \nIn either scenario, AAFA encourages TTB to require that all disclosures appear in one \nplace on the label, with standard placement, type, size and presentation \nrequirements to ensure consumer ease.  We note that a 2022 meta-analysis of \nstudies that assessed health warning labels on alcohol bottles found that placement \nof the label, as well as size, were associated with attention paid to them by \nconsumers.10  While allergen labels are somewhat different from other alcohol \nwarnings because consumers with allergens will likely specifically seek them out, TTB \nshould still consider minimum size requirements and consistent placement to ensure \nthat this information is easy for consumers to find and read. \nAAFA strongly urges TTB to ensure that, as for FDA-regulated foods, major allergen \ninformation is included on the label itself, and not provided separately via QR code or \nany other electronic link.  On-package labeling is the standard for FDA-regulated \nproducts and ensures that all consumers, regardless of technology access or skills, \ncan understand the information and make decisions to protect their health. \nCompliance Date \nAAFA encourages TTB to establish a compliance date of 3.5 years or less from the \ndate of publication of a final rule.  This policy has been under discussion for decades, \nand producers of alcoholic beverages should be able to accomplish this on that \n \n10 Citation: Giesbrecht, N.; Reisdorfer, E.; Rios, I.

TTB should work to assist any small producers who present with questions \nor need technical support to comply. \nConclusion  \nAAFA strongly supports common-sense regulation to mandate major allergen \nlabeling for wine, distilled spirits and malt beverages, to align with FDA’s requirements \nand consistently protect consumer health.

0,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'The proposed rule could significantly impact small wineries, particularly in terms of compliance costs, operational adjustments, and potential liability. Here&rsquo;s why:<br/><br/>Impact on Small Wineries:<br/><br/>Ingredient Disclosure Complexity &ndash; While wineries don&rsquo;t typically use major allergens as ingredients, some allergens&mdash;like egg whites (for fining), milk-based casein (for clarification), or wheat-based fining agents&mdash;may be part of the winemaking process. It is not always apparent whether trace amounts of allergens remain in the final product, so small wineries may need additional testing and record-keeping.<br/><br/>Compliance Burden &ndash; Small wineries may have limited resources to conduct allergen testing, verify ingredient sources, and update labeling. Unlike large-scale producers with dedicated compliance teams, small wineries may face higher relative costs in ensuring adherence to new labeling requirements.<br/><br/>Supplier and Process Transparency &ndash; Many small wineries rely on third-party suppliers for certain additives (like fining agents).

Here&rsquo;s why:<br/><br/>Impact on Small Wineries:<br/><br/>Ingredient Disclosure Complexity &ndash; While wineries don&rsquo;t typically use major allergens as ingredients, some allergens&mdash;like egg whites (for fining), milk-based casein (for clarification), or wheat-based fining agents&mdash;may be part of the winemaking process. It is not always apparent whether trace amounts of allergens remain in the final product, so small wineries may need additional testing and record-keeping.<br/><br/>Compliance Burden &ndash; Small wineries may have limited resources to conduct allergen testing, verify ingredient sources, and update labeling. Unlike large-scale producers with dedicated compliance teams, small wineries may face higher relative costs in ensuring adherence to new labeling requirements.<br/><br/>Supplier and Process Transparency &ndash; Many small wineries rely on third-party suppliers for certain additives (like fining agents). If these contain allergens, wineries will need to obtain and verify detailed ingredient documentation, which may not always be straightforward.<br/><br/>Potential for Consumer Confusion &ndash; If wineries are required to disclose allergens even when they are only used in processing (but not necessarily present in the final product), consumers might misinterpret the labels, leading to unwarranted concerns about allergens in wine.<br/><br/>Regulatory Uncertainty &amp; Legal Risk &ndash; If there is ambiguity about when an allergen must be disclosed (e.g., residual amounts after filtering), small wineries may face legal risks due to inconsistent interpretations of compliance.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This proposed rule could disproportionately impact small wineries due to additional testing, documentation, and labeling costs.

1,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'Since the creation of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in 2003 after an extensive reorganization of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the TTB has been the main agency in control of alcoholic beverages. The TTB works closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the health and safety of their consumable products. That being said, this proposed regulation is necessary and extremely important. The lack of major food allergens on wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages is outdated and could be dangerous. A food allergy is an impairment, where the body&#39;s immune system reacts negatively to certain proteins in food, that can limit a person&#39;s life activity and can qualify someone for protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, showing the importance of clear allergen labeling for consumers.<br/><br/>In the United States 6.2% of adults and 5.8% of children have a food allergy. Between 2000 - 2014, a study was tracking the deaths, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations due to food allergies in New York City. The study recorded that there were 24 deaths, 3049 hospitalizations and 4014 emergency department visits that were linked to food or drink allergies. Concerningly, out of the 24 deaths, 15 of the deaths were from allergens (milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame) that this regulation would enforce to be labeled on certain alcohol. That is not to say that the reactions took place due to consumption of alcohol, but highlights the importance and need to minimize harmful situations. This study also found a concerning trend that hospitalizations and ED visits increased throughout the 15 years. With this rising trend it would be wise to create a proactive regulation instead of a reactionary regulation. <br/><br/>According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health of 2023, there were 224.3 million people ages 12 and older or 79.1% of people in the US had drunk alcohol at some point in their life. A rough calculation would determine that approximately 13.7 million people have food allergies and consume or have consumed alcohol. With such a large percentage of the population consuming alcohol, the lack of allergen labeling presents a health risk to some individuals. Most other processed products and products that contain added ingredients require there to be an allergen label. Though the products that fall under these regulations are guided by the FDA while alcohol is not. This is also a detriment to consumers as most Americans would infer that since the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection (FALCPA) Act of 2004 and Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education and Research (FASTER) Act of 2021 that alcohol would also be covered. It would inherently be sensible for commonly consumed products to also have food allergen labeling. <br/><br/>Another concern for not labeling major allergens besides the health ramifications of some groups is the moral and religious aspect to it. There are certain religious groups that consume alcohol, but maintain dietary restrictions for some food items. In Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy some fasting periods can restrict meat, dairy, and fish. In Judaism, the Kosher laws prohibit foods such as pork and shellfish, meat can only be consumed if kosher-slaughtered, and forbid meat and dairy from mixing in the same meal. Additionally some grains are restricted during Passover. Without clear labeling on alcoholic beverages, it may make it difficult for people to adhere to their faith and could inadvertently consume ingredients that conflict with their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>That being said, there are people who avoid certain foods due to general moral concerns such as milk, eggs, and other animal-derived ingredients. These concerns could rise from industry standards or practices that make people more concise of what they consume. The addition of major allergen labeling allows for people to choose thoroughly what they put into their own bodies. Providing clear allergen labeling could assist people in choosing what they would like based on their personal values and dietary restrictions. <br/><br/>Implementing allergen labeling on certain alcoholic beverages is a matter of public health, the rights of a consumer, and can assist ethical considerations. Without clear transparency in labeling individuals with allergies could be at risk and consumers could mistakenly by breaking ethical or religious observances. Especially with the rise of food allergies and the dangers that come with them, it is important for alcohol to have similar labeling requirements as other food and drinks.<br/>All citations are in the attached file pdf.

The TTB works closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the health and safety of their consumable products. That being said, this proposed regulation is necessary and extremely important. The lack of major food allergens on wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages is outdated and could be dangerous. A food allergy is an impairment, where the body&#39;s immune system reacts negatively to certain proteins in food, that can limit a person&#39;s life activity and can qualify someone for protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, showing the importance of clear allergen labeling for consumers.<br/><br/>In the United States 6.2% of adults and 5.8% of children have a food allergy. Between 2000 - 2014, a study was tracking the deaths, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations due to food allergies in New York City. The study recorded that there were 24 deaths, 3049 hospitalizations and 4014 emergency department visits that were linked to food or drink allergies. Concerningly, out of the 24 deaths, 15 of the deaths were from allergens (milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame) that this regulation would enforce to be labeled on certain alcohol. That is not to say that the reactions took place due to consumption of alcohol, but highlights the importance and need to minimize harmful situations. This study also found a concerning trend that hospitalizations and ED visits increased throughout the 15 years. With this rising trend it would be wise to create a proactive regulation instead of a reactionary regulation. <br/><br/>According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health of 2023, there were 224.3 million people ages 12 and older or 79.1% of people in the US had drunk alcohol at some point in their life. A rough calculation would determine that approximately 13.7 million people have food allergies and consume or have consumed alcohol. With such a large percentage of the population consuming alcohol, the lack of allergen labeling presents a health risk to some individuals. Most other processed products and products that contain added ingredients require there to be an allergen label. Though the products that fall under these regulations are guided by the FDA while alcohol is not. This is also a detriment to consumers as most Americans would infer that since the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection (FALCPA) Act of 2004 and Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education and Research (FASTER) Act of 2021 that alcohol would also be covered. It would inherently be sensible for commonly consumed products to also have food allergen labeling. <br/><br/>Another concern for not labeling major allergens besides the health ramifications of some groups is the moral and religious aspect to it. There are certain religious groups that consume alcohol, but maintain dietary restrictions for some food items. In Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy some fasting periods can restrict meat, dairy, and fish. In Judaism, the Kosher laws prohibit foods such as pork and shellfish, meat can only be consumed if kosher-slaughtered, and forbid meat and dairy from mixing in the same meal. Additionally some grains are restricted during Passover. Without clear labeling on alcoholic beverages, it may make it difficult for people to adhere to their faith and could inadvertently consume ingredients that conflict with their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>That being said, there are people who avoid certain foods due to general moral concerns such as milk, eggs, and other animal-derived ingredients. These concerns could rise from industry standards or practices that make people more concise of what they consume. The addition of major allergen labeling allows for people to choose thoroughly what they put into their own bodies. Providing clear allergen labeling could assist people in choosing what they would like based on their personal values and dietary restrictions. <br/><br/>Implementing allergen labeling on certain alcoholic beverages is a matter of public health, the rights of a consumer, and can assist ethical considerations. Without clear transparency in labeling individuals with allergies could be at risk and consumers could mistakenly by breaking ethical or religious observances. Especially with the rise of food allergies and the dangers that come with them, it is important for alcohol to have similar labeling requirements as other food and drinks.<br/>All citations are in the attached file pdf.

I agree with this proposition and advocate for its approval as keeping the labeling legislation for alcoholic beverages poses severe risks to consumers with those major allergies. Most advocates on this matter believe the FDA and its allergen and nutritional label guidelines are sufficient regulations to be placed upon the wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The opposition to this issue is very little as to oppose such a motion may paint that party in a negative light and make them an indisputable opponent to public health in the United States. I will lay out my argument for the approval of this regulation and for it to follow FDA standards of transparency for the products affected.\n\nFirstly, I would like to explain and expose the issues with the current labeling system imposed by the TTB and its inadequacy. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms current policy of product transparency focuses on warning consumers of general safety and possible harm from the product. While important, they neglect to inform people of what is inside these products (Quinn). These safety warnings can be acceptable for some of the items this bureau is responsible for, such as firearms, but it is woefully inadequate for consumed products like alcohol. This is especially apparent when other products that are ingested like food, soft drinks, etc. are controlled by a completely different entity with the FDA and under that department face much stricter regulatory guidelines as products that are meant for ingestion, if left unregulated, pose a much greater risk to all members of society. When compared to firearms for example, which not all people interact with nor have to as opposed to drink products which are universally consumed. While I am not advocating for the transition of responsibility of wine, distilled spirts, and malt beverages to move from the TTB to the FDA, I still believe a lot can be achieved by imposing similar labeling system for similar products under their respective jurisdiction, like the case with alcohol.\n\nThere are millions of adults in the U.S. with food allergies, and they are at risk of coming into contact with their allergens inside alcohol. “Over 10 percent of adults in the Unites States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have experienced at least one foo-related emergency department visit” (Mendez). The nine major food allergens are Milk, Sesame, Soybeans, wheat, Peanuts, Tree nuts, Crustations, Shellfish, Fish and Eggs (Program). While some of these ingredients seem impracticable in a beverage with alcohol, many of these food products find their way into drinks like casein, chitin, fish oil, gelatin, etc. (Mendez). Even more allergens are added in the middle of production to add qualities and are removed later on but can still leave trace amounts (Quinn). Even with these possible exposures, there are very few cases of reactions to alcoholic beverages, but this number many be affected by underreporting as only the FDA has the proper reaction reporting system in place (Quinn) Still, many of these adults are in fear as many products have been proven to contain allergen particles, but the industry as a whole has refused to disclose this possibly life-saving information.\n\nDespite the necessity, there is some possible pushback from the industry as they are concerned about loss of profit. For the producers, entering into a mandatory allergen disclosure, similar to the FDA’s, would mean facilities would have to be inspected and factories would be responsible for controlling the handling of allergen material (Program). They would also have to remake transparent packaging and possibly incur loss of consumers once they become aware of the possible allergens in the product (Quinn). However, it should be argued that regulations like this should already have been implemented upon the production of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages as a consumable product. Just because it is controlled by another agency does not mean it can have special exceptions to general safety procedures to protect the people and public health as a whole. I believe any outward opposition, regardless of the reasoning or possible personal loss, should be viewed as an opponent to public health of all United States adults and their point be disregarded. It could even be argued that an increase of transparency between consumer and producer would increase sales as those with allergens who have been skeptical in the past could be assured safety in consumption of the product.\n\nIn conclusion, the safety and wellbeing of all adult Americans who drink alcohol will be affected whether the vote is affirmative or not. I have come here to voice my opinion that the TTB should move forward with a mandatory allergen labeling system and that it would be beneficial to consumers for it to resemble that of the FDAs. This would allow for an easy transition in systems and consistent transparency across the U.S. food and beverage industries.\n\nReferences\n\nAudrey Quinn. “Ain’t No Laws When You’re Producing Claws: How Inadequate Labeling of Alcoholic Beverages Puts Consumers With Allergies at Risk.” *Case Western Reserve University School of Law Scholarly Commons*, scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/healthmatrix/vol31/iss1/18.\n\nKenneth Mendez. “Letter to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regarding Major Food Allergen Labeling on Alcoholic Beverages.” *Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau*, letter, 29 Feb. 2024, aafa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/aafa-letter-supporting-allergen-labeling-alcoholic-beverages-29-march-2024.pdf.\n\nProgram, Human Foods. “Food Allergies.” *U.S. Food And Drug Administration*, 6 Jan. 2025, www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/food-allergies.'}]",TTB-2025-0003-0033,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-02-14 21:05:24,,False,Comment 31:  Emily Gard,090000648695c763,2025-02-14 05:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:29,See attached document for full comment ,m75-7mxj-lyw0,,Comment(s),0,,,Salem,VA,,United States,,Emily,Gard,,,,,2025-02-14 05:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:40,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

1,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0028/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': 'Hello,   First and foremost, I do believe that major allergies such as the nine categories mentioned in the regulation should be displayed on the various alcoholic beverages. This is for the safety of the public and for those choosing to engage in such activates. In 2006, food allergies in the nine categories were “estimated to affect about four million individuals in the United States” (Porter, 2006). Today, it could be more. The labeling of products is important to the public to ensure that everyone knows what they are ingesting. This could have a positive impact on business because those who are unsure whether a beverage contains any allergies, they may choose to avoid beverage out of caution. However, if labels are implemented onto either the packaging or onto the bottles/cans one could indulge as well creating more business.   A 2020 study showed that the way labels are implemented does have some impact. For instance, there was an 80% preference for bold facing the allergenic ingredients (Blom, 2020). This would immediately draw the eye to the components that would be most important clarifying and visually acknowledge ingredients that could be harmful. Additionally, 71% of the labels had a separate allergenic section (Blom, 2020). Once again, clarifying normal ingredients to ingredients that could be of harm. Having a section dedicated specifically to allergies could be more beneficial to someone who knows they have an allergy, as they would need to spend less time looking through the ingredients to determine if the beverage is safe for them to consume.   Further with labeling, the regulation mentioned the use of QR codes to easily display nutrients, allergies, and other information that may be of importance. There are some benefits to QR codes, especially for small business. “The most important advantage is that the QR Code can carry more information in a small space because they can be read vertically or horizontally” (Brabazon, 2014). With this, a smaller code that is big enough to be read by a cellphone can have a price benefit for business. Labels, and the production of them, can consume a lot of space and be costly of the manufacturer. Usually, when there is more of something, the price rises. By keeping a barcode small, but accessible, it would allow business consumers to apply these labels, inform consumers of the product, all while keeping the price at a reasonable cost. Some countries, such as the Australian winemaker, Jacob’s Creek (Brabazon, 2024) has already added QR codes onto the back of the bottles. This allows for the information that isn’t directly on the bottle to be placed in a separate location that is easily accessible to majority of the public.  I feel these changes to beverages such as wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages should be considered. The categories mentioned as major food allergies “are estimated to cause more than 90% of all food reactions” (Porter, 2006). Because of the amount of people that have potentially life-threatening allergies, they should be able to consume beverages without the worry of being in danger. I feel that it should be a right, just like with all other consumable for people to know what they are consuming. Therefore, the ingredients list should clearly specify the ingredients of the drink. I do believe that incorporating “Contains Major Food Allergens…” over “Contains:…” would be a good incorporation into specifying that not every allergen would be included but rather the major allergies. Today, there are a lot of different allergies not including the nine major categories. Other allergies such as food dyes, have been a common allergy and should also be incorporated into the labeling process. Recent discoveries have made the FDA aware about the dangers of red food dye. Beforehand, however, this dye was used in many foods and drinks, but since then has stopped. Likewise, a study found that a yellow-brown dye was used in some foods and in color liqueurs. The reaction from ingesting the dye caused anaphylactic reactions but also “chronic urticaria,” or also known as welts. The proportion of people with hypersensitive reactions was very small only affecting “.01-0.23% of the population but 2-7% of people with atopic backgrounds” (Treduler, 2022). Although the proportion is small, it is still a danger and people have the right to know for their own safety what is in the drinks. Safety, both for individuals and for a company should be a priority.   I believe that adding these changes, in a consistent and in a timely manner, do make a difference. Ease of access is a priority for a lot of people, and knowing the ingredients of food and beverages is a source of comfort for a lot of people as well. I think with additions such as labeling can make a difference in the consumer rate of some of these products. As a result, increasing business, and reaching new consumers that this business may not have reached before, but also providing those with allergies comfort and inclusion to activities they may have not had before.

Along with the fact that these common food allergens should be stated throughout all foods. ,m9h-n0tf-xtyn,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,Anonymous,Anonymous,,,,,2025-04-14 04:00:00,0,2025-06-24 22:04:01,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

These methods would likely cost the industry the same amount as a website as it would still require an adjustment to the label of the product. Additionally, it may be harder for consumers to access this information if they do not have compatible technology. The industry may lose business as this would be more time consuming for consumers and they will likely be less inclined to purchase the product all together. Therefore, major food allergen disclosures should be on the actual labels of the alcohol products in a position that makes it easy to read. <br/><br/>Second, while the 5-year proposed compliance date will likely reduce the cost to small businesses, however, if possible, I would recommend an incentive be imposed for businesses that comply prior to the proposed compliance date. This could help offset the cost of testing for allergen proteins and changing labeling, which would reduce the burden on the industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected. It is currently difficult to find allergen information for many of the major alcoholic beverage companies via their websites and company representatives, and even more difficult to locate this information for smaller companies and brands. The sooner the industry starts making these changes, the more likely consumers will feel comfortable purchasing products since they will confidently know whether or not it is safe for them to consume. <br/><br/>Finally, it is important for the rule to state that there shall be no amount of an allergen protein in the beverage in order for a company not to list that allergen on their label. Any trace amount of allergen protein can be detrimental for a consumer with an allergy. According to FARE (Food Allergy Research &amp; Education), 33 million Americans have food allergies and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction. TTB should require companies that claim to have distilled their beverage so that there is no allergen protein to submit these test results to TTB to ensure compliance.

(CIVYL), \nthe united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of \nspirits wines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, \nCasa Cuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and \nPernod Ricard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and \nimplementation of public policies related to alcoholic beverages. \nFirstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and \ncontribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is \ndedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of \nalcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately \ninform consumers without causing confusion. \nIn this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code \nof Federal Regulations under Notice No. 238, regarding the labeling of major food allergens for \nwines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. \nWhile we recognize the importance of providing consumers with relevant information, including \ningredients that may cause allergies, we believe that several aspects of this proposal could lead to \nunnecessary regulatory burdens. We consider that in addition to declaring the allergen, requiring an \nadditional legend or statement on labels such as “CONTAINS MAJOR FOOD ALLERGEN” \nfollow by a colon and the name of the food source, may not provide additional benefits to consumers \nwhile potentially increasing costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This may also \nnot align with Article 2.2 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which states that \ntechnical regulations should not be developed, adopted, or applied with the effect of creating unnecessary \nobstacles to international trade to achieve the legitimate objectives of member states.  \nIn the other hand, the approach to allergen labeling in various regulatory frameworks emphasizes clarity \nand minimal disruption to trade, in the case of Mexico, NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that \nfood allergens must be included in the ingredient list only when they are present in the final \nproduct, without requiring a specific warning and exclusively for liqueurs or creams, cocktails, \nand prepared beverages. \nSimilarly, the Codex Alimentarius General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS \n1-1985), was recently revised to recommend that major allergens be declared preferably within the \ningredient list. If a separate declaration is required, it should be limited to a brief ""Contains ___"" follow \nby the name of the allergen, statement placed directly below or near the ingredient list. \nAnd in the case of the United States, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim \nrule, T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)) allows wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily declare allergens \non labels using the term ""Contains,"" followed by the allergen name (e.g., ""Contains: egg"").  \nAs part of this, we understand the importance of declaring major food allergens to protect public health. \nIt is suggested to consider two alternatives for their declaration. \n \n \n \n  \nThe first option is to consider presenting the name of the allergen as part of the ingredient list, \nwhich should only appear on the label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs, or creams, as \nwell as any alcoholic beverages that, after distillation and/or before bottling, use optional \ningredients and/or additives that may cause hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy and are present in \nthe final product. \nThe second option is to consider the declaration allergens immediately after the ingredient list \nusing only the phrase ""Contains __."" This approach fulfills the legitimate objective of protect \npublic health, provide clearer information for consumers and align with existing regulations. \nHowever, if it is decided to proceed to modify alcoholic beverage labeling to include allergen information, \nwe strongly recommend allowing technological tools on the label to provide this additional \ninformation, such as electronic labeling (via QR code, digital platform, or website). \nThis tool offers the following advantages: \n• Provides unlimited space for consumer information. \n• Gives consumers more information in a user-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n• Facilitates compliance with regulatory changes. \n• Help deliver information to one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent \nharmful and excessive alcohol consumption. \n• Allows the development of engaging, educational, and interactive content for consumers. \n \nBy incorporating electronic labeling, necessary information can be provided to consumers \nwithout overcrowding the labels of alcoholic beverages, ensuring clarity and accessibility. \nFor these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less \nburdensome solutions. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nPanambí Garcés \nGeneral Manager \n \n \n \n'}]",TTB-2025-0003-0054,TTB-2025-0003-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-02 17:41:06,,False,"Comment 52:  Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C.

While we believe that adding allergen information for primary ingredients would be beneficial to consumers, we do not think that including allergen information for fining agents on our back labels would enhance consumer health and safety. Fining agents pose a very low risk of reaction (Pe&ntilde;as et al., 2015; Vassilopoulou et al., 2011; W&uuml;thrich, 2018), and most wine intolerances are due to sulfite sensitivity, histamines (not from fining agents), and diamine oxidase deficiency (W&uuml;thrich, 2018). <br/><br/>We have attached a more detailed comment.

The fact it has taken so long to require allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is quite alarming, especially while the market for alcoholic beverages and breweries has exploded. According to the Brewers Association, the number of breweries has grown six-fold over the past decade and a half [1]. However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption.<br/>To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t count&rdquo; yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public.<br/>When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages.

In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4.

If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that &ldquo;it gives you wiiings&rdquo; to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.<br/>'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0030/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': 'No\x00ce No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Dis\x00lled Spirits, and Malt Beverages\nI believe that the proposed rule will be of much beneﬁt to the American consumer, primarily to the \nreinforcement of informed consent in the purchasing of products.

However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption.<br/>To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t count&rdquo; yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public.<br/>When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 74% of respondents said they were in support of adding ingredients to the labeling, 65% supported adding allergens, and 66% supported adding calorie content [4]. On top of this, the CSPI found that &ldquo;more than 75% of respondents&rdquo; preferred reading this information on the label rather than through an online resource. Despite the favoritism, the government has made the majority of labeling policies voluntary. The CSPI found that only &ldquo;17% of labels contained an ingredients list&rdquo; [5]. In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4. This fact highlights the ongoing problems with alcohol regulation in the nutritionary field. If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that &ldquo;it gives you wiiings&rdquo; to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.<br/>",m74-1rvb-bewe,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,United States,,Lawrence,Kelly,,,,,2025-02-13 05:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:41,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,"In this proposed rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to

Creating a more transparent label for individuals with certain types of food allergies could help boost sales in specific types of wine, spirits, and malts as people with food allergies, such as the identified products in the proposed rule, would know to look at these kinds of beverages. Depending on the extent to which one may have an allergic reaction could be hard to pinpoint and, perhaps, vary from person to person, so having greater transparency on the bottle could relieve some stress for people with food allergies by not having to do things, such as research a bottle of wine or another beverage due to the fact there are undisclosed allergens used to make it. According to an article by Amy Greenberg of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, “over 10 percent of adults in the United States have food allergies, and 38 percent of these adults have experienced at least one food allergy related emergency department visit,” (Greenberg). This letter concerning the re-labeling and advertising of wines, spirits, and malts, also, mentions how the individual may react to a food allergen, as the response could range from shortness of breath, mild hives, or in extreme cases death. Another statistic worth noting comes from the National Library of Medicine and an article about allergic and intolerant reactions to wine. The data states that 10% of Americans are affected by hypersensitivity reactions to alcoholic beverages, one example given is red wine in particular (Wuthrich). The causes of the intolerant reactions ranged from fish gelatin to dairy products, which are some of the identified major food allergens the proposed rule discusses in its framework. This is an easily avoidable risk to prevent if the undisclosed allergens were to simply be placed on the bottle, and this is one reason the relabeling proposed rule would have my support. Another reason, I believe the proposed rule should have a fair amount of support is the fact that the framework of the rule does seem quite sound. For example, the rule’s says their definition of “major food allergen,” is consistent with that of the FD&C Act, the rule also goes on to list which specific products, for example milks, eggs, and fish, are fall under the statutory definition provided by the FD&C Act. This reason is, basically, an extension of my previous reason for supporting the proposed rule as with clear definitions consistent with other acts and statutes the process of labeling should be more streamlined, as companies would not have possible stress of ensuring their products may fall in one definition of major food allergens, but not in another. According to an article from the National Library of Medicine, 1 in every 20 Americans are burdened by cow’s milk allergy or CMA (Warren). So it is clear that ignoring having warnings or proper labeling disclosing the ingredient within a particular product could prove problematic and, perhaps, make the consumer more cautious of specific products from certain companies and potentially harm the market and have an overall negative impact on commerce. With this point, it can most definitely be argued to the extent of whether the impact on commerce would be substantial. Now, moving away from the labels themselves and the ingredients listed on them, I am also in support of the proposed rule because of the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations the rule is suggesting. The proposed rule suggests a five year compliance period and this is good for two reasons, which the act seems to make as main concerns. The first reason being for the five year compliance period is to limit the impact on small businesses, which the consideration of small business within the proposed rule may create further support for the proposed rule amongst people within small communities where local business may be more prominent. The second reason the framework provides is that the five year compliance period would prove to be less costly than, for example, a 2 year compliance period. The framework of the cost analysis of the act shows to those who are to view the proposed rule that the longer compliance is more beneficial for the public and government spending as a whole, as the two year period would demand about $161.7 million per year, whereas the five year period would demand about $40.2 million a year. Overall, I would say the proposed rule would be beneficial for reasons of safety and the overall cost it would need to come to fruition. The definitions and parallels with existing regulations and acts would make the proposed rule one that compliments other regulations nicely, and the positive affect would be seen in the market.\n\nWork Cited\n\nGreenberg, Amy. *Re: Labeling and Advertising of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages with Alcohol Content, Nutritional Information, Major Food Allergens, and Ingredients*. 2024.\n\nWarren, Christopher M., et al. “The US Population-Level Burden of Cow’s Milk Allergy.” *World Allergy Organization Journal*, vol. 15, no. 4, Apr. 2022, p. 100644, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2022.100644.

Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of \nAmerica (“WSWA”) is the only national membership organization of wine and spirits \ndistributors.  On behalf of its more than 380 member companies, WSWA advocates on their \nbehalf with regards to federal, state, regulatory, and legal issues impacting distributors and \nthe beverage alcohol industry.   WineAmerica is the National Association of American \nWineries, representing wineries, winery associations, and wine industry supply companies \nacross the country.  WineAmerica’s mission is to encourage the dynamic growth and \ndevelopment of American wineries  and winegrowing through the advancement and \nadvocacy of sound public policy.  The American Craft Spirits Association (“ACSA”) the only \nnational registered non-profit trade association representing the U.S. craft spirits industry. \nIts mission is to elevate and advocate for the community of craft spirits producers, and \nmembership in ACSA is open to anyone.  American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) is a \ntrade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in \nthe manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and \naround the world.   \n \nWe refer to Wine Institute , DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA \ncollectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   \n \nThe Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in Notice No. \n238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (“Notice  \n238”).  The comment period for Notice 2 38 is scheduled to end on April 17, 20 25. The \nAssociations request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would extend \nto August 15, 2025. \n \nAs a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily \nregulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of \nthe new administration.  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in \nthe final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the \nfirst day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries \nthey regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into \nplace since Notice 238 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and \nmidsize wineries , craft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great  costs and \noperational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even \nmeaningfully participating in the comment process means  they must redirect time and \nresources. \n \nNotice 238 is expansive—i.e., 16 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10- point, single -spaced \nfont—and poses at least 14 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It is \nalso the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that  it raises.  \nIndeed, TTB acknowledges in Notice 238 that it had been almost 20  years since it last \nsolicited comments on these issues .  Accordingly, it undertook two “virtual listening \nsessions” in February 2024, however, there was no proposed rule at that time and the notice \nissued just 28 days in advance of the sessions .  A ddressing these issues in response to a  \nproposed rule, and nearly two decades since the last proposed rule, will necessarily require \nupdated input.  That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of the proposed Page 3 of 4 \n \nrule—including the many questions and requests for comments in Notice 238—and for our \nmembers to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit the overall \nprocess and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. \n \nIt is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 23 8 will \nimpact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance \nof the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey \nthe input of all  our members to ensure their perspectives are  included and well-reflected.  \nTTB acknowledges that the Codex Committee on Food Labelling has been discussing food \nallergen standards, allergen labeling provisions, and a possible framework for evaluating \nexemptions for food allergens .  Our members need time to review and consider that same \nwork and related issues that evolved in the nearly two decades since TTB last addressed \nthese issues with a proposed rule.   Moreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 23 8 on \nimportant but s weeping areas of interest such as comments on “ whether there are better \nalternatives” to what it proposes.  Our members will need additional time to consider other \noptions available for those purposes  and then explain and discuss them  in submitted \ncomments. \n \nLast, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that \nimpact our members .  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing alcohol \nfacts statements in the labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same \nday as Notice 238 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 238’s \npublication, the FDA published a rulemaking propos ing front-of-package labeling for \nnutrition which will also impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice \n238, propose new rules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration .  We \ntherefore believe a 120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. \n \nWe would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request. \n \n[ SIGNATURES ON FOLLOWING PAGE ] \n  Page 4 of 4 \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n \n \nRobert P.

In order to reduce \nthe burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to prevent any \nproblems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following requests: \n \n[Comment 1] \nRegarding nutrient labeling requirements, we would like nutrients to be listed only if \nmentioned nutrients are present at a certain level or higher. In the case of alcoholic \nbeverages, most products do not contain, or contain only a de minimis amount of, \nfat and protein. We believe that it should not be mandatory to label substances that \nare not present or that are present only a small amount in a product. \n \n[Comment 2] \nTTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule is \npublished in the Federal Register. As it is necessary to ensure that businesses have \nsufficient time to prepare for making changes to labels of their products, we request \nthat the proposed 5-year period be maintained, and not be shortened. \n \n[Comment 3] \nGiven that label space is limited, in order to reduce  the burden on businesses we \nwould like it to be possible to provide Alcohol Facts through electronic  means such \nas QR codes. By allowing the use of electronic means, we believe that businesses \nwill find it easier to accommodate different languages and to update information, \nthereby reducing the burden of displaying Alcohol Facts. If this request is not granted, \nthis will become a trade barrier. \n \n[Comment 4] \nAlthough the proposal does not make analytical testing mandatory, nevertheless we \nwould like the TTB website to clearly state proper analytical testing methods for each \nnutrient for reference.

Kennedy, Jr.     The Honorable Scott Bessent \nSecretary        Secretary \nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services    U.S. Department of the Treasury  \n200 Independence Avenue SW      1500 Independence Avenue SW \nWashington, DC 20201       Washington, DC 20220 \nRe: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau - Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the \nLabeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages \n \nDear Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Bessent, \nOn behalf of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a national health no-profit organization, I write \ntoday to call your attention to the negative health effects of alcohol and to ask you to inform consumers by \nmoving forward with the proposed alcohol labeling rule. These labels will help fulfill the administration’s goals of \npreventing and reducing chronic disease. \nThe “First Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health” was issued in 1971, but even by that time \nthe health risks of consuming alcohol had already been well documented.1 As the evidence on alcohol’s health \nrisks continues to mount, our organization recommends the current warning label on alcoholic beverages, which \nfirst appeared in 1989, be updated to better protect Americans by listing specific health risks, as well as nutrition \nand allergen information. \nThe label, which has not been updated in more than 35 years, currently reads: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) \nAccording to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the \nrisk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate \nmachinery and may cause health problems.”2 \nUsing the vague term “health problems” leaves Americans unaware of the true toll alcohol consumption can have \non health, including a growing understanding of how it raises the risk of several types of cancer. It is vital that this \nlabel be updated to reflect the increased evidence and understanding of the specific risks of alcohol consumption. \nIn January 2025, the Surgeon General released “Alcohol and Cancer Risk,” an advisory report that cites scientific \nevidence on the link between alcohol consumption and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, \nincluding breast (in women), colorectum, esophagus, laryngeal, liver, mouth, and throat.3 The report recommends \nthat the existing Surgeon General’s health warning label on alcohol-containing beverages be updated to include a \nwarning about the risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption. Our organization, which has 17,000 doctor \nmembers, already recommends avoiding alcohol as part of our Let’s Beat Breast Cancer campaign, which \nprovides healthcare providers and the public with evidence-based resources and powerful steps to reduce breast \ncancer risk.4 This campaign echoes the recently passed policies of the American Medical Association, which \nsupport not only clearer alcohol labelling but also efforts to educate the public about the benefits of lifestyle \nchanges that may reduce breast cancer risk, including limiting alcohol intake, regular physical activity, \nmaintenance of a healthy body weight, and a healthy plant-based diet.5 This policy also encourages physicians to \nregularly discuss with their individual patients the benefits of lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk.  In addition to adding a cancer warning, we recommend that the label also address other health risks to the liver, \nbrain, gut, pancreas, lungs, cardiovascular system, immune system, and other parts of the body, as detailed by the \nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.6  \nIngredient information should also be included for those looking to avoid allergens—such as sulfites and grains \nlike wheat, rye, or barley—or animal products that are sometimes used as flavoring or fining agents, which are \nused to filter out impurities and improve the clarity of some alcoholic beverages. 7 Common animal-based fining \nagents include milk byproducts including whey, casein, and lactose. Other ingredients commonly found in \nalcoholic beverages include eggs; isinglass, which is derived from fish bladders; and gelatin, which is derived \nfrom animal skin, bones, and cartilage.8 Consumers who wish to avoid consumption of these ingredients, whether \nfor health or other reasons, should have access to this information. \nUpdated warning labels on alcohol are long overdue and should reflect current knowledge about the health risks \nof alcohol, as well as allergen and ingredient information that will help Americans make well-informed decisions. \nThank you for your attention to this important issue. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nStephanie McBurnett, RDN, LDN \nNutrition Educator \nPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine \n \n \n \nReferences: \n \n1 National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Ryan \nAdministrator \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) \nU.S. Department of Treasury \n \nComment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of \nWines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) \nVIA ONLINE SUBMISSION \nDear Administrator Ryan:  \nConsumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important \nrulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest \n(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and \nTobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and \nMajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to \nstrengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in \ngrams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the \nformat and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how \nthis rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and \nto urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the \nbasic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other \nbeverages and food. \nLeading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol \nlabeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates \nalcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers \nwhat’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with \ncheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, \nCalley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full \ntransparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 \nCFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol \nlabeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the \navailable evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have \ndocumented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that \n \n1 hƩps://foodbabe.com/alcoholic-drink/  \n2 hƩps://foodbabe.com/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/  \n3 hƩps://www.statnews.com/2025/01/14/alcohol-health-risks-rŅ-jr-maha  \n4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but \nsignificant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  \nSimilarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard \ndrinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate \ntheir alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that \ndo not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more \nconscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of \nalcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related \nharms.7  \nThese spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to \nconsumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for \nSurgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third \nbiggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can \nincrease the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public \nawareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate \ndrinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating \nthe health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage \nLabeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that \nworthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its \npledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  \nThere is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see \non the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism \ncan end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   \nThank you for your consideration of these comments.  \nSincerely,  \n  \nThomas Gremillion \n Director of Food Policy \n Consumer Federation of America \n \n \n5 hƩps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/arƟcle/abs/pii/S0091743517302359  \n6 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.1186/s12889-023-16327-x  \n7 Rossow I, Mäkelä P.

The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses\nThat Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust\n\nCensus Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that\nsmall businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the\nbeer, wine, and spirits industry:\n\nLine of Number of Firms That Had\n\nBusiness Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage\nBreweries 3,214 2,609 81%\nWineries 3,576 2,975 83%\nDistilleries 760 659 86%\n\nIn the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and\nSpirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than\n6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.\nThe report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the\nnumber of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has\n\n2 90 Fed.

The Biden-proposed rules would impose\nunaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive\nbarrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in\nthe industry who can.\n\nThe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\nfail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared\nthat “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities\nhas in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,\n\n4 Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022), p.\n8.\n\n5 Indeed, the Department of the Treasury admitted, in explaining the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling\nRule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at\n5775, col. 2.\n\n§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,\nsale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,\ndiffering views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and\nconsumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,\nmoral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these\nquestions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and\nspirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound\nscience and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.\nNFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits\nhave available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage\nenvironments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out\nto Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-\nalcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025).

Congress\nalso noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated\nbusinesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to\ninefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some\ncases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental\nand economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules\nsimply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately\ndismisses it.®\n\nPresident Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the\ncountry’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:\n\nMy Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built\non common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators\nfirst. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade\npractices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°\n\nTo help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting\nred tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen\nLabeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\n2. TTB Did Not Get the President\'s Deregula’ Message\n\nPresident Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they\nshould seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days\nafter TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule\nand the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order\n14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The\never-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on\nthe lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic\ngrowth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He\nalso said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private\n\n8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB\nconsidered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is\nnot proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of\nthe proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who\nare allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a\npermanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage\nlabels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such\nproducts.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all\npseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to\ncombat.\n\n® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).\nexpenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic\nprosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”\nHe emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate\nunnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°\n\nOn February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring\nLawful Governance and Implementing the President\'s ‘Department of Government\nEfficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should\nidentify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that\nimpose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”\nand “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private\nenterprise and entrepreneurship.”*\'\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-\nCompetitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not\npredetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that\nreduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they\ncreate for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed\nagency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...\ndistortions on the operation of a free market.”!2\n\nThese are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though\nimproperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive\nSuggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,\nissued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.\n\nTo comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the\nquoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-\nproposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the\nDepartment of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to\nthe specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head\nof TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that\nunreasonably burden small and other businesses.\n\n1° Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (January 31, 2025), 90 Fed.

These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record\n\nTTB says\'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a\nrecommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in\nthe Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits \'4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a\nFebruary 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)\'®\njoined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or\ntogether, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-\nproposed rules.\n\nRegarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes\'® the Executive Summary at\nthe front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that\ncould serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,\nsuch as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been\nimplemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB\nshould revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory\ninformation on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In\nbetween the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the\nreport, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the\nrecommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by\ncommenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report\nrecommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the\nrecommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient\nlabeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was\ntherefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen\n\n13 90 Fed, Reg. at 5763, cols. 2 and 3, and 6554, cols. 2 and 3.\n‘4 Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022).\n\n8 Available at https:/Avww.cspi.org/sites/default/files/2022-\n03/Letter%20requesting%20leadership%200n%20improving%20alcohol%20labeling%20to%20protect%2\nOpublic%20health. pdf (visited July 25, 2025).\n\n‘6 in the preamble of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, 90 Fed.

Advocacy to the federal and\nstate governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by\nthe First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state\nconstitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a\ncomplete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.\n\n4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails\nLegal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue\nthe rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the\nbenefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to\nimpose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal\nAlcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by\nthe beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,\nmisleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,\nobscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only\n\n20 90 Fed.

The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of\ntitle 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.\n205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,\nto provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the\nproduct, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the\nauthority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,\nanalyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the\ncase of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the\nState into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at\n5764, col. 1.\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major\nallergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep\n(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things\nthat are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or\nimporter -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,\napplying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that\nCongress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”\nunless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen\nlabeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue\nthe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains\nMajor Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in\nfact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that\nTTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits\nwith its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech\nthat is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,\ndistilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in\nthe production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major\nallergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the\nallergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility\nin exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if\nthe allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°\nIf an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but\n\n23 The U.S, beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (Source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-1 92dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf), and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM. pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market (all sources visited July 25, 2025).\n\n24 The proposal requires labeling for any of nine major food allergens: milk, egg, fish, Crustacean\nshellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. 90 Fed.

To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:\n\n... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the\ncost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry\nmembers would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the\nAlcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new\nallergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just\none label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°\n\nThe TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business\nassuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling\nRule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal\nduty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and\nmust consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°\nTTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes\nof the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a\nfinal Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not\nan Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,\nbut not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to\ncomply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603\n\n27 See TTB discussion of using “scientifically valid analytical methods’ to verify the absence of proteins in\nfinal products. 90 Fed.

The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails\nLegal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the\nrule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and\nExecutive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by\nlaw.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury\nDepartment claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)\nchapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)\nsection 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant\nthe authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration\nproposed.\n\nOf the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only\nthree provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)\nREQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the\nrevenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits\nissued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,\nsale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5\nwine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section\n5368 provides:\n\n(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and\ngauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such\nmanner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\n31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).\n\n22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has\nno power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until\nCongress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)\n(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that\nCongress has provided."").\n\n33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.\n1\n\n(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,\nvehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with\nthis chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\nSection 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or\nsale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled\nin such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be\nremoved from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled\nspirits plants under section 5222.”\n\nThe three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.\nSection 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for\ndistilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.\nSection 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the\ncomparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different\nfrom marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to\nimpose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of\nlabeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also\nthat the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to\nlabeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by\nvolume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412\ngrants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.\nAccordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue\nCode to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or\nbeer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.\n\nThe Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal\nAlcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by\nthe beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,\nmisleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,\nobscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol\nFacts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\n\n34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in\none section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).\n12\n\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the\nrequirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,\nalcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.\nAlso, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes\nthat Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic\nsignificance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant\nalcohol facts labeling authority.\n\nThe Treasury Department\'s triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for\nScience in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2\n(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which\nit can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide\nconsumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.\nCircuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional\npredecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,\nthere is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates\nCongress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient\ndisclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of\ndiscretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,\nas necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with\nthat congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the\nagency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,\n104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme\nCourt rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which\nthe Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its\n\n3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were\ndefined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to\nauthorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.\n\n36 The U.S. beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-192dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf}, and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM.pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market.\n\n37 90 Fed. Reg. at 6655, col. 3.\n\n38 Center for Science in the Public interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2 (D.C.\nCir. 1986).\n13\n\nmeaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their\nindependent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory\nauthority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9\n\nSo, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that\nleaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.\nCongress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when\nit wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the\nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little\nbenefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost\nthe industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement\n(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent\nyears for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has\nno reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to\npurchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without\nadmitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them\nto purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling\nrequirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they\notherwise would have faced.\n\nAs for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of\nalcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to\nquantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in\nthe absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”\nassuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.\nIn the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule:\n\nTTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but\nas stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide\nconsumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of\nalcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice\n\n38 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024).\n4 24 U.S.C. 343(q).\n\n41 90 Fed.

Reg. at 6684, col 2.\n14\n\nabout moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional\ninformation about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.\n\nThe first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\n“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a\nthread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts\nlabeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would\nmean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but\ncarbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.\nAlso, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery\nstore), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in\na bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it\nmight be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts\nlabel diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with\nrespect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the\nAlcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to\ncompare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a\nhigher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should\ntake human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on\nassumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\nThe second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\nprovide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient\ncontent of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the\nproposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing\nthe additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the\nlabeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the\nlabeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\ngreatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.\n\nThirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-\nproposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”\n\n4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information\nrequirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per\ncontainer, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.\n\n48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of\nlegal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in\na day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better\nfor health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who\nare pregnant.”).\n\n47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or\nany other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United\n15\n\nTTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5\n“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And\nimmediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,\nwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\nBut that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to\nthe proposed rules.\n\nn\n\nThe data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises\n(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in\nthis case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the\nproposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account\nof recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is\n$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298\nper year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the\nBiden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making\nabout $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed\ncharge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.\n\nParticularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its\ndecision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities:\n\nThe production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an\nindustry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and\nadvertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding\nmore elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant\nimpact on the regulated industry.°!\n\nThe TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding\nmore labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential\npolicy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.\n\nkkKEK\n\nStates, the agency shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis.”\n\n48 90 Fed.

Greenberg \nDirector \nRegulations and Rulings Division \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \n1310 G Street, N.W., Box 12 \nWashington, D.C.  20005  \n \nRe:  Comments to TTB Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB–2025–0002) \n \nDear Director Greenberg,  \n \nCampari America LLC (“Campari America”), a producer and importer of distilled spirits in the \nUnited States, submits the following comments in response to the TTB’s Notice No. 237, “Alcohol Facts \nStatements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ,” Docket No. TTB –2025–\n0002.  Campari America is a subsidiary of Davide Campari -Milano N.V., which began in 1860 with its \none eponymous brand.  Today, Campari America sells a wide range of beverage alcohol products in \nthe United States, but is most well-known for its portfolio of liqueurs, including Campari, Aperol, Averna, \nFrangelico, Cynar, Braulio , and Grand Marnier .  Many of t hese brands, like those of many other \nsuppliers, are not accurately represented in the TTB’s currently proposed serving size reference table, \npasted below for reference, and which is the basis of our comment today.   \nServing size Alcohol percent by volume \nWine Distilled spirits Malt beverages \n1.5 fl oz (44 mL), or 50 mL for 50 \nmL containers of distilled spirits \nn/a > 24% > 24%. \n2.5 fl oz (74 mL) > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% \n5 fl oz (148 mL) 7 to 16% > 7, up to 16% > 7, up to 16% \n12 fl oz (355 mL) n/a ≤ 7% ≤ 7%. \n \nProposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Low ABV Liqueurs Are Consumed in Cocktails \n \nThe serving sizes recommended above are based in the assumption that the only means of \ndrinking a wine, beer, or spirits beverage is straight, unmixed with other beverages.  While this may be \nmostly true for wine and beer, it is most certainly not true for distilled spirits which often serve as \n“ingredients” in a wide range of cocktails.  By way of example, Aperol \uf0d2, which has an ABV of 11%, is \nmost commonly consumed in the form of an Aperol Spritz \uf0d2.  When making the brand’s signature \ncocktail, the typical amount of Aperol used is typically 2 ounces, i.e. less than half of what would be \nconsidered its reference serving size under the TTB’s proposal.  Another Aperol cocktail growing in \nDocusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 \n \npopularity is the Paper Plane (0.75 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz Aperol, 0.75 oz Amaro Nonino, and 0.75 oz \nlemon juice), in which the Aperol consumed is less than 1/5 of the TTB proposed serving size. \nCampari\uf0d2 faces a similar issue.  While it can be served in a Campari Spritz (typically 1.5 to 2 \nounces), it is also popularly served in a Boulevardier (1 oz Campari, 1 .5 oz bourbon, and 1 oz sweet \nvermouth) or a Negroni (1 oz Campari, 1 oz gin, and 1 oz sweet vermouth) or a Negroni Sbagliato \n(substitute prosecco for gin ).  There is also the Americano (1oz Campari, 1oz sweet vermouth, and a \nsplash of club soda) and the Garibaldi (1.5 oz Campari and the fresh juice of one orange, approximately \n4 oz). \nExamples of similar uses of other low-ABV liqueurs in cocktails abound.  Simply put, these are \nnot products that are typically drunk straight.  So while the ABV of a lower proof distilled spirit may be \nsimilar to wine, it is not consumed in the same manner – thus using the same serving size as wine of 5 \noz., or even 2.5 oz, significantly overstates and distorts the actual serving size of these low ABV liqueurs \nin a way that is misleading and confusing for consumers.  \n \nProposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Ready-To-Drink Canned Products Are Consumed \n \nConversely, for many other products, such as  ready-to-drink can s of  “hard” seltzers and \ncocktails, the currently proposed serving sizes greatly understate the actual serving sizes of these \nproducts.  These products are commonly sold in a 12 -oz can and can vary from 3.5% to 1 4% ABV.  \nSpirits-based cocktails are not the only beverage alcohol products facing this issue:  many beers and \nother malt-based beverages now exceed 7% ABV yet are sold in the same 12 oz size cans.  Likewise, \ncanned wines, with ABVs ranging from 8 to 15%, are also sold in sizes larger than the proposed serving \nsize of 5 oz.  In these instances, having a serving size reference range that is less than the container \nsize will certainly mislead consumers into thinking they are drinking less alcohol than they really are. \n \nRecommended Serving Sizes Already Have A Long-Established Framework and Methodology \n \nAs a proposed solution, we recommend adopting an approach similar to  the methodology of \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for recommended serving sizes for food and non-alcoholic \nbeverages.  The FDA creates reference points, known as “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed” \nor “RACCs,” for different categories of food and beverage, and the FDA then recommends that \nmanufacturers use those RACCs as a guideline for determining their advertised serving sizes.   \n \nIn the food and non -alcoholic beverage realm, FDA-required labelling became required in the \n1990s.  Consumers are long accustomed to this method of calculation of serving facts, with \nrecommended or actual consumption amounts being the guiding factor in determining the size.   The \ngeneral understanding of most consumers is that a serving size reflects the size portion of intended or \ntypical consumption, or, in the case of single -serve packs, the container size, rather than being based \non the amount of one of its components .  One analogy would be if the FDA mandated serving sizes \nbased on the grams of protein in a product, such as 5g of protein equals one serving size.  This would \nresult in a double serving size for a granola bar, and a very small serving size for beef jerky.  Similarly, \nthe TTB’s proposed serving sizes are based on the amount of alcohol in a product, resulting in arbitrary \nand sometimes incorrect serving sizes.  The current proposed TTB’s serving sizes would conflict with \nDocusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 \n \nthe general understanding of most consumers who have been conditioned for decades to perceive a \nserving size as the recommended amount and/or most customarily consumed amount. \n \nIf the TTB were to adopt a serving size reference range that mirrors the FDA ’s process, this \nwould allow consumers to buy products and understand serving sizes within a framework that they \nalready know and are familiar with from the food and non -alcoholic beverage space.  This w ould also \naccommodate the realities of the types of drinks that consumers are currently havin g or making w ith \nbeverage alcohol in the 4% to 30% ABV range and would minimize consumer confusion over  serving \nsize, especially with respect to ready-to-drink canned products. \n \nAlternatively, if the TTB wants to maintain the serving size reference ranges proposed in Notice \nNo. 237, then another recommendation would be for the TTB to allow an exception for suppliers to \ndeviate from the proposed serving size reference range if they  can demonstrate that the proposed \nserving size does not reflect the actual amount of their product that is typically consumed.  This would \nallow the TTB to maintain the current framework but still provide flexibility for those suppliers whose  \nproducts are typically consumed as one part of a cocktails. \n \nWe thank you for your consideration of our comments.

The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required \nwhen the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify \nwines and beers. \nAt a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the \nexposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert \nCommittee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the \nEuropean Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an \nestablished history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the \nreference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of \nexposure for derivative safety assessment. \nThe EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or \nfish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen \nlabelling. \nAs regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled \nSpirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, \nthe EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines \non the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-\n2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars \nincluded in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  \nsuch as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to \nhighlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory \nindication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, \ncontrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated \non traded alcoholic beverages. \nFinally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed \n5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the \noperators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before \nthe proposed rule comes into effect. \n \n(1) FAO/WHO Report – Risk Assessment of Food Allergens; \nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240088924  \n2 \n \nThe EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comments could be taken into \naccount and replied to before adoption of the notified draft. \n*** \n \n \n \n  \nElectronically signed on 07/08/2025 11:43 (UTC+02) in accordance with Article 11 of Commission Decision (EU) 2021/2121\n'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0154,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-08 17:40:34,,False,Comment 151:  European Commission,09000064b8eef1b4,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the European Commission, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (GROW) International Value Chains &ndash; A3.<br/>",me1-yppw-c4ct,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,"European Commission, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (GROW) International Value Chains – A3",,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:23,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits\nproducers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and\nits membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on\npotential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.\nWhile the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two\nnotices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit\ncomments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise\nsimilar concerns for Kentucky\'s spirits industry. Please accept the following as the\nKDA\'s comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket\nTTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to\nrequire the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of\ndistilled spirits.\nSince the KDA\'s founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and\nresponsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky\'s signature Bourbon and Distilled\nSpirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world\'s\nsupply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As\nsuch, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and\nadministrative impact on our members.\nLaw Offices: Lexington I Louisville I Frankfort\nGovennment Affains: Frankfont\nmcbnayenf inm.comMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 2\n1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers\nThe KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs\nassociated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft\nproducers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to\ndistilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff\nand capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be\nan expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping\nunits (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued\ntesting would be cost prohibitive.\nIt is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated\nto be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits\nlabels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic\nand logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive\npackaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real\nestate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them\nignore key labeling information altogether.\n2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion\nThe proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces\nredundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by\nvolume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the\nrequirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further\nby requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,\nwhich will result in customer confusion.\nCustomers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being\nquantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on\nthe Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of\nalcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or\nmisinterpret the label entirely.\nFurther, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes\nproteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed\nAlcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in\nthe product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer\nwould reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that\nthere are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.\ntMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 3\nThe KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due\nto the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.\n3. Digital Labeling Options\nSpirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As\ndiscussed, to keep consumers\' attention and give them the ability to learn more about\ncertain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such\nan approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy\n\'click through\' for the latest and more in-depth product information.\nMoreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for\nprinting new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant\nenvironmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost\nninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for\nhelping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less\nenvironmental effects.\n4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process\nAs TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -\nincluding gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a\nproper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled\nspirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the\nexception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled\nspirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced\npost-distillation.\nThe KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption\nregarding TTB\'s testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-\ncase basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself\nby requiring lab analysis of every product.\nIf the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final\nrulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due\nto the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation\nproduct. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause\ntremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be\n\'gluten-free\' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about\ngluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill\ninformation or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.\nIncluding more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 4\npotential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential\ncustomers.\n5. Conclusion\nAs TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to\nconsider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations\nthat consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and\nother spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are\nalready well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing\nmore than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing\ninefficiencies.\nSincerely,\nRRIS\nTNM\n4904-9883-6316, v. 1'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0157,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-11 16:46:13,,False,Comment 154:  Kentucky Distillers' Association,09000064b8ef45da,2025-08-11 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,See attached comments on behalf of the Kentucky Distillers&#39; Association.

FEVS's \nmembership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with \nexports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for \nFrench wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). \n \nFEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American \nconsumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and \nquality of the wines and spirits they purchase. \n \nTherefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on TTB’s proposed rulemaking. \n \n \nOn the title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nFEVS encourages TTB to adopt the tile “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”, as the proposed content \nof the statement refers to nutrition information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverage, rather than \ninformation on alcohol. Therefore, the title “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest that \nthe statement includes general indication on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. \n \nIn addition, consumers are accustomed to the title “ Serving Facts” and to the fact that this is related to \nnutrition information of the beverage they intend to purchase or consume, since most operators who \ncurrently voluntarily disclose nutrition information use “ Serving Facts ”, as acknowledged by TTB in the \nNotice. As a consequence, choosing the “ Serving Facts” title would also limit costs of re -labelling for these \noperators. \n \nLastly, FEVS believes that the similarity between “ Serving Facts”, which could apply to alcoholic beverages \nregulated under IRC, and “ Nutrition Facts”, required for alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA rules, is \nmore beneficial to consumers as it ensures a kind of coherence on how the nutrition information is provided \nfor all products proposed for sale on the market – even if the content of their respective statement may differ \nas proposed by TTB for the former. \n \n2 \nOn the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nFEVS thanks TTB to take into account particularities of the wines and spirits production process and sector \nby proposing a content of a nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what \nis required for other food products through the FDA Nutrition Facts label. \n \nNevertheless, FEVS would like to underline that wine or spirits do not contain fat or proteins and is wondering \nwhether the compulsory presence of these two elements in a n Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \nwould provide useful information to consumers when choosing which alcoholic beverage they want to \npurchase or drink. Whether TTB decides to keep these two elements and considering the limited space of \nwine and spirits labels, FEVS suggests allowing operators to replace these two lines by a unique sentence like \n“Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the Statement. \n \nFEVS takes note of the voluntary sugar content  statement as proposed by TTB. In case operators choose to \nindicate it, FEVS kindly requests TTB to clarify how precisely they will have to label it and how the articulation \nwith the carbohydrates content TTB intends to require will have to be made. \n \nMore globally, FEVS would like to raise the attention of TTB regarding the difficulty adding other elements \nto the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, including through a voluntary approach, \nbecause of: \n• the non-relevance of nutrients like sodium, cholesterol, saturated fat… for alcoholic beverages, \n• the risk introducing nutrients like vitamins or minerals or percentage of the daily value may lead to \nunintended alcohol consumption behaviors, \n• the fact that the more information is added within the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, the \nmore the impact of the most relevant ones for consumers, notably calories, will be diluted, \n• the limited space available on wine and spirits packaging (compared to other food products), \n• the difficulty for operators to put in place the full traceability, risk assessment and analytical procedures \nto guarantee the loyalty and accurate content of such information, \n• the possible impact of such requirement on a trade perspective, for products imported into the US as \nwell as for US wine and spirits exported to third countries. \n \nIn case TTB is willing to require or to give operators the possibility to include additional elements in the \nAlcohol Beverage Information Statement, FEVS strongly encourages TTB to allow this statement to be \nprovided by electronic means like QR-Code (see below). \n \nFinally, FEVS welcomes the tolerance of 20% above or below proposed by TTB as well as the use of “typical \nvalue” charts in order to ease the ability of wine and spirits operators, especially SMEs, fulfilling the envisaged \nrequirements. FEVS strongly encourages TTB to work as far as possible with US trade partners to develop a \ncoordinated approach on these “typical values”. \n \nFEVS would like also to stress the importance of including in the TTB regulation the notion of  “average \nvalues” a s defined by Codex Alimentarius for the nutrition declaration\n1. Being complementary to \ntolerances, “average values” would allow operators to provide accurate information to consumers while \navoiding the re-labelling of their products each year because of crops or evolution of the production method. \n \n \nOn the alcohol content statement \n \nFEVS takes note of the TTB proposal requiring an alcohol content statement, expressed as a percentage of \nalcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverages products, as well as an indication of this statement \n \n1 See Point 3.5 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling: “The values used in nutrient declaration should be weighted average values \nderived from data speciﬁcally obtained from analyses of products which are representative of the product being labelled.” 3 \nwithin the existing  tolerances (in substitution of an indication in terms of ranges). This is aligned with EU \nrules and will ensure consistency in the presentation of products regardless of their alcohol content. \n \nFEVS would also appreciate whether TTB could clarify if this requirement would apply to non-alcoholic wines \n(less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) sold on the US market, too. \n \nOn the other hand, FEVS asks TTB not to require the inclusion of the alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement. While practical modalities regarding the placement of the alcohol content may differ \nbetween malt beverages, distilled spirits or wines, c onsumers are used to find this information in the same \nfield of vision of other compulsory particulars. In addition, under current TTB regulations, the alcohol content \nhas to be labelled in a bigger type size than other compulsory information. Therefore, FEVS does not see why \nincluding alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, among several other elements \nrelated to the product, will guarantee a better visibility or understanding for consumers. \n \nIf TTB want s nevertheless going forward on this, FEVS kindly recommends proposing it as an option for \noperators, allowing them the possibility either to indicate the alcohol content as it is today or to include it in \nthe Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. \n \nFEVS would also like to share concerns regarding the compulsory indication of the alcohol content in fluid \nounces of pure alcohol. Firstly, concept of pure alcohol is not always well understood by consumers. Thus, \nproviding this information without context would not necessarily empower consumers to make informed \nchoices or to understand why and how it differs from the alcohol content expressed in volume by alcohol.  \nSecond, FEVS notes that TTB is allowing operators, in addition to these two elements, to indicate the alcohol \ncontent in degrees of proof ; meaning the same information could appear in three different forms in the \nAlcohol Beverage Information Statement. \n \nBeyond issues related to limited available space o n labels and to the complexity for foreign operators who \ndo not usually use the fluid ounces of pure alcohol as unit of measurement, FEVS fears the proposed approach \ncould lead to an important risk of confusion by consumers. \n \nIn addition, FEVS tends to consider that a “per serving size” presentation could increase the difficulties for \nconsumers to fully understand the elements provided in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. As \nrightly pointed out in the Notice, serving size reference amounts could be considered  by consumers as a \nrecommended consumption amount rather than a way to determine the  alcohol, nutrient or calorie intake \nof a specific beverage. Besides, since serving size would have to differ depending on  the alcohol content of \nthe product, this will prevent consumers from making comparisons between several alcoholic beverages on \ntheir respective nutritional impact, due to the lack of an identical basis for comparison. \n \nThis approach will also lead to additional complexity for wine and spirits companies, especially exporters who \nare not used to managing serving size and/or will have to manage specific ones for the US market. \n \nFEVS would also like to recall that Codex Alimentarius recommends that the nutrition declaration should be \nexpressed per 100 ml and “in addition, this information may be given per serving as quantified on the label“\n2. \n \nWhether TTB confirms its intention to request nutrition information to be provided in pure alcohol per \nserving, FEVS strongly suggests TTB to allow the electronic display of these elements. Indeed, the presence \nof a QR -Code on a label could facilitate the provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure \nalcohol and standard drinks, including in relation with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans  if relevant, \nwhich would not be practically feasible on a physical label. It  would also reduce the conformity c osts for \noperators, especially those non-US based,  thanks to  automatic calculation of nutrition content of their \nproduct and conversion of the figures into US unit measures (see below). \n \n \n \n2 See Point 3.4.2 and 3.43 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling 4 \nOn the Alcohol Beverages Information Statement disclosure \n \nWhile acknowledging the flexibilities proposed by TTB for the display of the Alcohol Beverages Information \nStatement (ie, linear display option and lesser rules in terms of format and size on the panel), FEVS strongly \nreiterates its call to TTB for allowing these information to be distributed by electronic means. \n \nAs previously raised, electronic labelling offers a wide range of advantages to both consumers and operators, \nespecially SMEs. Indeed, this digital mean makes it possible: \n• for companies, to have a tool adapted to the variability of wines and spirits, thus limiting the costs of \nmodifying packaging, while guaranteeing the loyalty of the information,  \n• for the consumer, an easy and permanent access to information (including for people with disabilities), \nupdated in real time and in his own language (in or outside the US territory), \n• for public authorities, to avoid the creation of barriers to trade by facilitating convergence of standards \nand administrative cooperation: \no between the United States and wine and spirits exporting countries, \no between federal regulations and the increasing number of labelling requirements in force at \nState level (e.g. with regard to beverage packaging deposits schemes). \n \nIt also has to be noted that technological challenges (like adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage) or ability to \naccess for particular communities are evolving very quickly, having in mind any final rule on Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement would only apply in more than five years from now. \n \nIn the EU, the labelling of energy and nutrition information and the list of ingredients is compulsory for wine \nproducts since December 2023 and the spirits sector commit to provide these information on a voluntary \nbasis. The EU experience demonstrates the possibility of using the advantages of the QR -Code without \nlowering the ability of consumers to access  key information for their health and for making informed \nchoice. Indeed, for companies willing to use digital means, EU regulations oblige them to indicate the calories \namount as well as the allergens on the physical label, while other information, compulsory or not, are \ndisplayed online, via a direct and free of marketing information link. \n \nFEVS would like to underline how aligning EU and US requirements on nutrition and energy information \nwould be beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, while allowing each party to keep \nits own preference on the content of the information to be provided according to its respective context. This \nwould also allow the EU  and US to set a global standard which could support the development of digital \ntechnologies and avoid trade barriers in third countries market. \n \nIn the case of physical labelling, FEVS requests to remove the black box around the Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement, especially when provided in a linear format . This appear not to be proportionate \nor justified as the title “ Serving Facts” in bold type on a defined space which is a label is sufficient to allow \nconsumers to easily locate the information on the packaging. \n \nOn the implementation period \n \nFEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the statement. \n \nIn addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to \nput on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force \nof any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. \n \nFinally, if TTB adopt s a final rule on Major Food Allergens labelling (as envisaged in Notice  of proposed \nrulemaking No. 238), FEVS asks for an identical date of entry into force for both regulations . This will \nprevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost this approach could have for \nthem, especially for SMEs.

If most alcohol beverages contain only minimal or negligible amounts of sugar, requiring its inclusion would provide little added value to consumers. Similarly, we agree with TTB’s assessment that sodium and other micronutrients should not be included, and we believe they should not be referenced in the proposal at all.*\n\n*We believe that including daily value percentages for nutrients on alcohol beverage labels would be confusing for consumers. Such information could misleadingly suggest that alcohol contributes meaningfully to meeting daily nutritional requirements, which is not the case. Given the fundamental differences between alcoholic beverages and foods, adopting the Nutrition Facts format used by the FDA would not be appropriate in this context.*\n\n*Given that many alcoholic beverages contain negligible amounts of nutrients beyond calories, requiring full nutrition facts similar to FDA food labels could be unnecessarily burdensome and confusing, potentially disadvantaging certain products in both domestic and international markets.*\n\nCalculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels\n\n*We support the proposed tolerances of ±20% and the use of ""typical values"" as a valid alternative to mandatory testing. Allowing broad tolerances and the use of tables or calculation methods to estimate nutrient levels is important to keep costs down and maintain competitiveness. Requiring precise in-house testing or sending products to third-party labs would create significant financial challenges, especially for small producers who make small batches and cannot spread testing costs over many units.*\n\nMandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products\n\n*We have no objections to the proposal requiring an alcohol content statement expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume on all alcohol beverage labels. This requirement does not pose any issues, as it is already mandatory in Argentina to indicate the alcohol content on all wines. Such labeling ensures transparency for consumers and aligns with existing international practices.*\n\nPlacement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement\n\n*While it is likely that including alcohol content information within the Alcohol Facts statement could make it easier for consumers to locate this information, this advantage may not be particularly significant. Consumers are generally accustomed to looking for alcohol content in various parts of the label, and the overall impact on their ability to find this information is expected to be minimal.*\n\n*The implications of including the alcohol content within the Alcohol Facts statement should be carefully analyzed to avoid the requirement of declaring the alcohol content in two separate locations on the label.

This approach helps ensure clarity and prevents redundant labeling. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the agreements established within the WWTG. If the information must appear in multiple locations on the label, this could increase label redesign and printing costs. Additionally, unclear placement requirements might lead to confusion among producers, complicating compliance efforts and potentially increasing administrative burdens. Moreover, having the alcohol content displayed in two different places with differing values could lead to labeling errors and mislead consumers.*\n\nMandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol per Serving\n\n*If it is mandatory to indicate the alcohol content as a percentage by volume, requiring additional information about the alcohol content per serving size or standard drink would be redundant and could potentially confuse or mislead consumers.

Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\n*We suggest allowing the possibility of using electronic means, such as QR codes, to present this information, especially for small containers or labels with limited space, while ensuring that mandatory physical labeling remains the minimum requirement.*\n\nServing Size Reference Amounts\n\n*Proposed serving size amounts should be reference values only. Each consumer, if interested, can evaluate their total intake of alcohol, nutrients, and calories when consuming amounts greater than the reference serving size. The reference amounts serve their purpose by providing a consistent basis for labeling and informing consumer choices without implying a recommended level of consumption.*\n\n*According to Wine in Moderation, the reference consumption guidelines are: up to 2 units of alcohol per day for women (equivalent to approximately 200 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV), and up to 3 units per day for men (approximately 300 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV).

The \nmain objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the \nalcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. \nKey points of the proposal: \n\uf0b7 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is \nproposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: \n1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid \nounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). \n2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. \n3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. \n4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal \nestablishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary \ndepending on their alcohol content. For example: \ni. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) \nii. Wines: \n1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. \n2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. \niii. Distilled spirits: \n1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; \n2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; \n3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid \nounces (44 ml) \n4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. \n \n\uf0b7 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different \nformats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. \n \n \n \n \n \nCompliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register \nis proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. \n \nComments on the proposal: \n\uf0b7 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but \nquestion the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not \nconsidered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-\n006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the \ndeclaration of the product\'s alcohol content. \n\uf0b7 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of \nalcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested \nthat this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, \ndigital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. \n\uf0b7 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, \nproteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as \nif these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius \nguidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and \nthat nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption. \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the \nNutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do \nthe differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  \nmisleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s \nlabeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the \nlisted nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? \nAlternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol \nbeverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? \nOur position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely \nbenefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage \nlabeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels \ncould easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which \nwould only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting \nnutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that \nalcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing \ndecisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. \nFurthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are \nfundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic \nbeverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol \nitself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol \nconsumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as \nsomehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current \nlabeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are \ndistinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, \nwhich goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT \nAgreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers \nto international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly \nrecommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This \nmakes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial \nburdens. \nDigital labeling offers many advantages: \n\uf0b7 Unlimited space to inform consumers. \n\uf0b7 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n\uf0b7 Easy updating as regulations change. \n\uf0b7 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks \nof harmful alcohol consumption. \n\uf0b7 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. \n \nThis approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using \ntechnology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. \nFinally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to \nimplement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for \ndistribution in the U.S. \n2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be \nallowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further \nbreakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \nIt is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and \ntrans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the \nmisconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. \n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such \nas trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? \nThe inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be \nmisle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could \nconfuse consumers. \n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol \nbeverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create \nan erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other \nhealth-related benefits? \nIt is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could \ncreate a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true \nand could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or \nrehabilitation benefits. \nThe General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be \nlimited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them \nas something that improves health or well-being. \nFurthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages \nfrom being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from \npromoting harmful eating habits. \nThe Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition \nby establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, \nrehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. \nIn summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or \nhealth benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such \ndeclarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. \n5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in \nadvertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? \nNo comments on this topic. \n6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might \nconsumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the \nidentity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol \nFacts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated \nwith such revisions? \nThe current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol \nFacts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate \nunnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. \n7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol \nbeverage market? \nThis measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and \ndistributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would \ngo against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical \nregulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives \njustified by member states. \nAccording to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly \nnecessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures \nwould have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased \ncosts associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new \nshipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, \nnew businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? \nThe proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, \nespecially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  \nanalyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply \nchains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. \n9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of \nalcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the \nproposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? \nIt is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade \nin alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to \nconsider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the \nuse of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical \nlabels, while reducing operational costs. \nConclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol \nis sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided \nelectronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant \ncosts, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic \nbeverages in general. \nEnd of the document  '}]",TTB-2025-0002-0155,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-08 17:48:33,,False,Comment 152:  Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT: Chamber of the Tequila Industry; Mexico),09000064b8eef1f6,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, C&aacute;mara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT for its acronym in Spanish).",me1-yvgk-mej0,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,The Chamber of the Tequila Industry (CNIT – for its acronym in Spanish; Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera),,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:23,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

Our members include \n31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base \nin Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion \nin 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United \nStates. \n \nWe would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Alcohol Facts Statements in the \nLabeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” to the WTO TBT Committee. We welcome the \nopportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if \nneeded. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as flexible as possible, and do not result \nin unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while ensuring the meaningful information of \nconsumers. \n \nIn this context, spiritsEUROPE would like to highlight the following key requests: \n• Replace the title of the informational statement with “Serving Facts” instead of “Alcohol \nFacts” to more accurately reflect its content.  \n• Permit the use of digital tools , particularly QR codes , to provide the “Serving Facts” \nstatement to minimise the impact of the new rules on trade, align with existing industry \npractices and self-regulation, as encouraged by the European Commission, and – for wine – \nexisting EU requirements. \n• Keep the inclusion of ABV and the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the “Serving Facts” \noptional, as the ABV is already stated elsewhere on the container and the concept of ""pure \nalcohol"" is not widely understood by consumers. \n• Introduce greater flexibility regarding serving sizes, as they vary across countries and can also \ndepend on the category of spirits and the alcohol content of the product. \n• Ensure both proposals enter into force simultaneously and include a stock exhaustion clause \nfor all products placed on the market prior to implementation. \n \nYou will find our detailed comments and recommendations on these proposals below. \n \nI. Comments on the “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages” \n1. On the Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nWe believe that the title of the informational statement should be “Serving Facts” and not “Alcohol \nFacts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the nutritional information in a \nserving of a specific alcoholic beverage . “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest \nthat the statement includes general indications on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. In \naddition, consumers are accustomed to finding nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement \nbecause most operators who currently voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the \ntitle.  \n \n  \n 2 \n \n2. On the Display of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) \n \nspiritsEUROPE would kindly recommend that TTB allow the possibility to make the “Serving Facts” \nstatement available electronically, in particular through the use of a QR code. Although exempted to \ndo so by EU law, the EU spirits sector decided to develop an ambitious self -regulatory approach to \nprovide consumers with: \n• (language free) energy information on the back label (per 100ml and serving, in kJ and Kcal – \nas is standard for other food and beverages  in the EU) including the number of portions per \ncontainer; and \n• the full nutrition al information (including fat, carbohydrates and protein) via the scanning a \nQR code present on the back label. \n \nThe latest report published on 18 June 2024  shows that the share of spirit  drinks bottles complying \nwith the self-regulatory commitment on the provision of consumer information has grown from 0% to \n70% in just 5 years. \n \nCompanies are also increasingly mirroring this approach outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. \n \nWhile this approach is a self -regulatory commitment for the spirits sector in the EU, it is a legal \nrequirement for the wine sector since 8 December 2023, including for US wine bottles exported to the \nEuropean Union. Aligning EU and US requirements on nutritional and energy information would be \nbeneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since EU requirements for \nwine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well beyond the EU. \n \nOn the other hand, considering the high number of EU spirits companies that provide nutritional \ninformation digitally, having two substantially different systems in the main markets of both partners \nwould create a significant barrier to trade . This would negatively affect both US and EU companies \nseeking to export to the other market. \n \nThe benefits of a single, aligned  approach that combines on -pack labelling and digital labelling \nelements are manifold. Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and \nuser-friendly feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a \nsmart phone or other electronic device.  \n \nIn addition, digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: \n• Digital labels empower economic operators to swiftly update information  and to adapt \ninformation to consumers easily, while reducing waste and costs associated to changes with \ntraditional physical labels, thus promoting sustainability. \n• Recycling information and other sustainability -related information can easily be integrated \ninto digital labels. One such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling \ninformation for glass bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible \ndigital labels since last year.  \n• Digital labelling is also SME friendly : craft producers will benefit from being able to provide \ndigital consumer information as it enables them to drastically cut down on labelling costs and \nexplore new markets, for instance thanks to the geo-sensitive nature of QR codes. This is true \nfor craft producers from overseas, who will find it easier to enter the US market, providing \nconsumers with more choice in the process. This is equally true for US craft operators, who \nwill be better able to export to other markets by making use of digital labelli ng to minimise \ndifferences and reduce costs.   \n \nIn the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical label, \nwe would kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by a \nbox. We would like to stress  that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement,   \n 3 \nregulations should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The \nspace available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would unnecessarily \ntake up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in bold type is sufficient \nto allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label. \n \n3. On the Content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) \n \nAs noted above, the space available on a label of distilled spirits is limited . We therefore appreciate \nthat the TTB is not proposing to align the “Serving Facts” statement with the Nutrition Facts Label of \nthe FDA. We also welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations. \n \nHowever, in the spirit of facilitating international trade of alcoholic beverages, we would like to \nreiterate our recommendation that the TTB aligns its proposal with the requirements in the EU for \nwines (including US wines exported to the EU) , i.e. to require the provision of energy information on \nthe label and of nutritional information online. \n \nWhether online or on the label, the “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the \nalcohol content statement (alcohol by volume, ABV) . As the Notice  rightly points out , for distilled \nspirits, the ABV is already required to appear  in the same field of vision as the brand name and the \nclass designation. Consumers are therefore used to finding this information on the main/front label. \nParticularly in the case of physical label, space is limited and adding it to the “Serving Facts” would not \nadd any value.  \n \nIn addition, we would kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving \nin the “Serving Facts” statement optional . Providing this information without context would not \nnecessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pure alcohol is not well \nunderstood. On the other hand, the presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the provision of \nsubstantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary \nGuidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. \n \nFinally, we very much welcome the fact  that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA \napplications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion  or alteration of the “Serving \nFacts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the inclusion or \nalteration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” statement in this manner. \n \n4. On the Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts \n \nWe would also welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes.  We believe the \nproposed approach to serving sizes does not accurately reflect how our products are usually \nconsumed. \n \nServing sizes can vary from country to country and vary depending on the ABV of the product. There \nis a wide variety of spirits above 24% and the serving size of a 65% ABV absinthe would be different to \nthat of a 24% ABV liqueur. \n \nIn addition, this approach fails to take into account that lower ABV spirits (such as liqueurs ) are \ntypically consumed as part of mixed drinks rather than as standalone pours. Mandating rigid serving \nsizes based solely on ABV thresholds may mislead consumers and conflict with customary serving \npractices and supplier recommendations. For instance, liqueurs and cordials often recommended in 2 \noz (60 ml) pours could be inaccurately represented by a 5 oz (150 ml) serving size under the proposed \nrules. This misalignment risks confusing consumers, undermining brand integrity, and inadvertently \nencouraging higher alcohol and calorie consumption. \n  \n 4 \nThe proposed approach also fails to account for the rapidly growing Ready -to-Drink (RTD) category, \nwhere products with very similar profiles but slightly different ABVs (e.g., 7% vs 8%) could be subject \nto inconsistent and confusing serving size declarations. \n \nRather than enforcing a one -size-fits-all mode l, we urge TTB to allow producers flexibility in \ndetermining an appropriate serving size reflective of how the product is intended to be enjoyed. This \ncould be done by retaining the current serving size guidelines as optional defaults, while also \npermitting customised serving sizes where justified by product type and consumption patterns. This \nflexible approach would provide consumers with more accurate and meaningful information while \nallowing producers to maintain control over their product presentation and brand integrity. \n \n5. On the Proposed Implementation Period \n \nspiritsEUROPE welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic \nclimate for our sector, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for our members. \n  \nWe would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on \nthe market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of our products can often \nbe slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. \n \nFinally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238: Major Food \nAllergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into force is \naligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages.

And as we discussed, the heart and soul of the Georgia wine industry is small &quot;mom and pop&quot; farm wineries. <br/><br/>Agritourism, and agritourism-related income is a huge industry in Georgia. With approximately 100 wine producers in Georgia, we generate over 43,000 jobs, 500,000 tourist visits, and $99 million dollars in consumer spending, with $589 million generated in state and local taxes and $256 million in federal taxes.

It can be difficult to find out about or access federal resources. An Agritourism Act or other resources to aid with loans, grants, activities and best practices for vineyards and wineries would be a tremendous source of support for not just the farmers, vineyard and winery owners, but would be a benefit to the many other industries supported by the tourism draw of the wineries. <br/><br/>The boon of agritourism is that it enables small farmers to expand their business and increase profits, while subsequently boosting many facets of the local economy. Visitors to local wineries dine in restaurants, stay in hotels, and shop in small businesses.

As an \norganization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US understands the importance of \nleveraging data and technology to improve transparency and enhance consumer access to detailed \nproduct information that supports informed decision making. We commend TTB’s commitment to \nthese goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute our insights. \n \nFor over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver \nsafe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC \nbarcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners \nidentify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions \nof businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 \nmembers across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage \nproduction, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. \n \nAs a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify \nindustry challenges and build consensus on best practices for solving them by leveraging global \nstandards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global \nstandards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards \nhelp empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access \nto the information they want and need about those products. \n \n2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Alcohol Labeling \nGS1 US recognizes the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with \nessential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, \nparticularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid \nin achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as the UPC barcode, can only hold a limited \namount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  2 \nstoring much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates, \nvintage, age, and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing \ncomprehensive information in a compact format. \n \nIncorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) – the globally unique \nproduct identifier embedded in UPCs today - can effectively support consumer access to detailed \nnutrition information. The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and \nconsumer value of digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform \nlaunched in 2015 to provide detailed product information via QR codes, which leverage GS1 \nStandards. This approach is in line with food industry initiatives like SmartLabel® and promotes \nconsumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. This digital approach can \nwork in tandem with the required physical label disclosures, enhancing the essential information \npresented to consumers. It not only meets the transparency goals of the proposed rule but also \nenables future enhancements, including ingredient disclosures, allergen declarations, information \nregarding sustainability practices, or responsible consumption messaging.  \n \nA GS1 Digital Link enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and \nnutritional information, including allergens and dynamic data such as recalls or safety alerts, \nthrough a simple smartphone scan. In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and \nnutritional information, 2D barcodes encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and \ninteroperable format, ensuring accuracy and consistency across retail and digital platforms.  \nIncluding the GTIN in a QR code with GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product \ninformation. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into gateways to consumer \ninformation, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand loyalty while improving \nsupply chain traceability. \n \nMoreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up valuable label \nspace. QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater \ncapacity for information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing \ncomprehensive data. Moreover, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already \nfamiliar with scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American \nadults use smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said that they would scan a QR \ncode to access product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers \nconsumers to easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. \n \n \nApplication of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information \nGS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification \nand efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open standards can significantly \nenhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be applied to \nsupport industry compliance with Alcohol Facts requirements: \n \n1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, \nparties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  3 \nmanufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to \nrecognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information. \n2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies \nsuch as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical \ninformation like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate \ncapture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. \n3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data \nformats allows for seamless information exchanges across the supply chain. This \ntransparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their \nconfidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by \nfacilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. \n \nConclusion \nIncorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN identification, 2D barcodes, and GS1 Digital \nLink into the TTB’s Alcohol Facts labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance consumer \naccess to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only help industry stakeholders \nefficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future advancements in \nthe digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively with TTB, industry \npartners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of this important \ninitiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the opportunity to \ncontribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol beverage \nproducts. \n \n \nSincerely,\u202f\u202f  \n\u202f  \nMaggie Lyons  \nVice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs  \n ""}]",TTB-2025-0002-0168,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-13 23:23:09,,False,Comment 165:  GS1 US,09000064b8efb38b,2025-08-13 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,GS1 US Comments on TTB Proposed Rule - Alcohol Facts Statement Labeling ,mea-4prg-nm4z,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-08-13 04:00:00,1,2025-08-15 13:38:36,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA, dedicated to promoting evidence-based policies that protect public health and safety. We would like to offer the following comments on the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposed rulemaking for 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237.    It is past time for the baseline labeling requirements for alcoholic beverages to be brought in line with those of nearly every other food product. As a consumable product, alcohol is responsible for a substantial morbidity and mortality burden, causing 178,000 deaths per year in the United States, of which 117,000 were due to health complications arising from drinking recklessly over the long term.1 Yet in many cases, consumers have little knowledge about what is in a bottle of alcohol—extending even to how much alcohol, the key ingredient that exempts these products from labeling requirements, the package contains.  The need for these extends far beyond a general intent to support the public’s health. Surveys show that consumers have overwhelming expressed support for additional information when purchasing alcoholic products, 77% strongly supporting more information on alcohol content specifically.2 This information is critical for supporting emerging alcohol consumption trends, which increasingly favor “mindful drinking” that centers intentionality, control, and a deeper understanding of how consumption impacts the body.3 We applaud TTB’s efforts to move forward with regulation that addresses this information gap.  We would like to offer the following feedback to TTB’s specified concerns. We are not addressing all questions posed in the Request for Comment, only those for which we believe we have public health-centered arguments.  Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Sheet  \n1.  “Alcohol Facts” is preferable to “Serving Facts” as it centers the idea that alcohol is not a nutrient and alcoholic products are not a standard part of any diet. It also flags that there can and will be information in that area that goes beyond what would be expected on a standard label, specifically alcohol content.  3.  Consumers will reflexively seek content information in the same place they find it with other products. For the purposes of alcoholic beverages, that would be the white box with specific product contents specified, even if said box is labeled “Alcohol Facts” instead of “Serving Facts”.   4. “Alcohol Facts” would provide some helpful distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, but only for motivated consumers. If drawing a clear distinction is a priority—and with the explosion of “crossover products” that use a known nonalcoholic brand identity to sell alcoholic beverages,4 TTB should be establishing further plans to require clear disambiguation.  Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information  1.  We support harmonizing the “Alcohol Facts” requirements with standing FDA requirements. A large part of this support is based on the principal that alcoholic beverages should not be exempt from simple obligations to inform that every other consumable has to abide by. We recognize the concern about consumers assuming they can get nutrients from alcohol consumption, however the industry already engages in misleading health impact claims.5 The irony is that, at present, voluntary “Nutrition Facts” labels are often used to support these claims, while the relative validity of them is untestable because so many products opt not to have those labels. In this instance, consistency creates accountability.  2, 3.  We support as close an analogy to the FDA warnings as possible, even in the case of nutrients that are rarely found in alcoholic products, because rarity is not the same as a guarantee that a product will not have an exceptional amount of sodium or trans-fats.  4.  So long as the producer is allowed to claim an alcoholic beverage contains any given vitamin or mineral, they should be obligated to attest to the amount that is in the container.  6. Popular support for “Alcohol Facts” is quite high, ranging from 64% for nutritional content to 77% for alcohol content.2 Being able to not only understand that contents of an alcoholic beverage, but to be able to compare them while in the store, forms a core principle of informed shopping—as well as a core principle of bodily autonomy, when you consider the fact that without them most people do not know what is going into their bodies. On a less abstract level, across-the-board nutrient labeling allows consumers to avoid nutrients they wish to avoid, and to verify claims made by manufacturers.  9. Although international regulations are heterogenous, there is no case in which erring on the side of more on-label information would complicate an export—but many cases in which too little on-label information would do so.   Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products  1.  The exemption from alcohol by volume (ABV) labeling for “table wines” creates an explicit health hazard. The range of strengths under which labeling is not necessary creates an inability for the consumer to responsibly track their consumption. The risks from acute overconsumption, when comparing e.g. half a bottle of 8% ABV wine to half a bottle of 13% ABV wine, are moderate but present. The risks from chronic consumption at that level are substantial. While we maintain that the “j-shaped curve” is largely an artifact of poor study design,6 even studies which support that curve find that purported benefits evaporate for both sexes at consumption levels of 3 drinks per day or more.7 With the enormous ranges of tolerance within table wine labeling, it can easily lead to unwitting overconsumption.  3. An increase in tolerance for reported ABV on packaging very easily can lead someone to consume more than they intended, particularly within larger bottles and similar containers. This could create severe health impacts over the long run.  4. Based on the principle that all products sold for consumption should be transparent about ingredients, “non-alcoholic” malt beverages should also be subject to nutrition labeling requirements.  6. A range of content as wide as “7% to 14%” is tantamount to not providing any information about ABV.  It is impossible to plan for one’s alcohol intake when the information given is so uncertain.   Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement  1.  The preferred venue for alcohol content information would be on the front of the label, in large type, in a readily legible font. Having alcohol content information in addition be part of the Alcohol Facts label would still serve consumers well, however.  It would be easy to locate, would facilitate comparison between products, potentially reduce the ability of producers to disguise ABV—or, in some cases, market a clearly dangerous level of alcohol as part of the design.  2. The Alcohol Facts should err on the side of more information and greater uniformity between products’ labels. If a consumer is looking at two products’ labels, and one has alcohol content while the other does not, it increases the burden on them to find the needed information.   Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving  1.  We stand with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in pushing for standing servings of alcohol to be included on packaging. Every interpretive step a consumer has to take makes an informed decision more difficult. Currently, USDA and other Federal consumption advice takes the form of a standard drink. 8 Unless there is a cross-agency plan to shift advice to center on fluid oz., the current label still creates challenges to advancing the most impactful outcome from alcohol per serving labeling: avoiding dangerous patterns of consumption.    3. Standard drink should be defined and used in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. This becomes crucial when you get to packaging that does not adhere to the sizes used in Federal advisories. Consumers tend to interpret a “drink,” particularly in the case of non-resealable containers, and this leads to persistent underestimation of the amount of alcohol they are actually consuming.9  For instance, a 16 oz. can at 6.9% ABV could be reflexively considered one drink. However, both because of the high alcohol content and the added volume, it far exceeds that, and two containers of this per night would be well over the hazardous chronic consumption threshold. Research suggests that the reflexive assumption of one “drink” per container can be altered through education,10 but for the TTB label revisions to facilitate that, the information must be standardized and easily referenced against an easily memorized standard—which already exists in the form of the standard drink.  In light of TTB’s concerns with legibility, a conservative alternative would be to provide standard drinks within a range, e.g. “0.5–1 standard drink,” “2-3 standard drinks,” etc.  So long as the upper bound is equal to or greater than the actual number of standard drinks, it would ensure that informed and accurate decisions could be made in terms of health impact.   4. The labels should have a definition of “drink,” as well as a commonly accepted, verifiable risk threshold for chronic harm in terms of drinks per day, that aligns with and can be checked against a reputable source.   5.  As of this writing, preliminary reports are that the United States Department of Agriculture will not be defining hazardous levels of drinking in the forthcoming dietary guidelines. If this is the case, then we recommend defining highly risky drinking according to definitions set forth by NIAAA or a reputable NGO such as the American Medical Association.   Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information  1.  Linear display of Alcohol Facts should be acceptable so long as it is consistent among containers of that size. Allowing producers to choose between two formats, however, would add to consumer confusion and impede the intended benefits to consumers.  2.  A box is a simple and expedient way to standardize the appearance of Alcohol Facts across producers, which should be the goal. While there are other ways to create a readily identifiable standard, the box makes for a straightforward and unambiguous requirement.  3.  We also strongly urge TTB to adopt dimensional limits on type beyond simply font size, since poor kerning or highly condensed fonts (such as those used in the legacy health warning on alcoholic beverages) are extremely difficult to read.  7. Anything other than putting ingredients, nutrition facts, servings per package, and standard drinks per package directly on the bottle is a mistake. QR codes suffer from a number of shortcomings.  First, there are equity concerns about labels that are only visible via smartphone. They assume consumers own smartphone, which, although common, are expensive products and not universal.11 They assume regular access to cellular connection. And they create an additional burden on the consumer to access and compare the information they are seeking. These burdens are not distributed equally, but tend to disproportionately impact individuals in rural areas, those with lower socioeconomic status, and older consumers.   There is a secondary concern that the chain of custody for the Alcohol Facts data becomes increasingly baroque as we begin adding in digital storage. This creates inaccuracies and accountability issues, which not only risk discouraging consumers seeking good information, but in making audits and corrections increasingly more difficult.   Lastly, Alcohol Facts through QR codes contain no guarantees that consumers would not, for instance, have to provide contact information, or be protected from cookies and other web traffic monitoring being enabled on their devices. The simple act of enjoying a consumer’s right to know should never be a channel for surreptitious information harvesting, especially when it regards products for which aggressive, targeted marketing can create serious psychological and physical problems for the consumer.   QR codes, in short, build sizable, gratuitous walls between consumers and the information they deserve, and make consumers more vulnerable to predatory marketing.   9. Electronic disclosure should not be allowed. If it were, however, information with immediate consequences to health should still be on the bottle, including alcohol content, standard drinks, and sugars.  10. Not only would allowing multiple options create consumer confusion, it would undermine the value of universal Alcohol Fact labeling requirements in validating marketing claims. Once again, producers would put on-package labels for products billed as “healthy” while burying the labels for other products on a website.    Serving Size Reference Amounts  1.  The specified fluid ounce/milliliter quantities on the Alcohol Facts labels will be difficult for consumers to picture.9 A graphical explainer, showing how much of a standard wine glass, shot glass, or beer stein each quantity refers to, would be essential. For some categories—especially the 2.5 fl. oz. and 5 fl. oz. sizes—the ABV range covered within in that serving size creates a large discrepancy in standard drinks. For the 2.5 fl. oz. category, the upper bound is the same as a serving of “standard” distilled spirits.  For the 5 fl. oz., however, the upper bound (16% ABV) would be substantially more, as is 12 fl. oz. at 7% ABV.    All of this would be obviated, of course, by using standard drinks. Failing that, the ABV upper bounds for each serving size should be set to be the equivalent of one standard drink.  3. Any flexibility in serving size should come with the obligation to clearly, graphically describe the quantity of that specific alcoholic beverage being referred to.  4. Standard drinks are the only quantity framing which has utility in empowering consumers to engage in healthier behavior. It is correct to say that this does not reflect the way that beverages are consumed. The outcome from that, however, would not be confused consumers, but rather health-motivated consumers eschewing single-serve containers with excessive standard drinks.   Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Display Panel  1. Dual-column nutritional facts in food products have been shown to influence consumption behavior even in individuals not actively looking to change behavior, with non-dieting individuals eating as much as dieting individuals when given dual-column nutritional details.12 As such, TTB should expect that dual-column Alcohol Facts labeling will result in moderated consumption, not in normalizing consuming more servings.  2. Five-plus serving, non-resealable containers definitely exist in the U.S. alcohol market, and are among the most dangerous products sold. Anything that encourages purchasers to consume less than the full quantity should be applauded, and evidence from food studies suggest that dual-column displays should do that.  3. There should be no upper bound on standard servings per container before a dual-column label is used. The obvious threshold should be the nature of the container itself; if a container has more than one serving and is not resealable, it should be expected to carry a dual-column label.  4. Having a vague threshold of 200% of serving reference size before a dual-column label is required may result in the proliferation of packaging that is 199% the size of a regular serving. The easiest way to obviate this is to set the cutoff at 100%.   Again, we are grateful to TTB for undertaking this effort, and for giving us the opportunity to comment. As public understanding of alcohol risk increases, the demand for accessible, accurate information grows as well. While we feel there are still some shortcomings in how alcohol quantities are being conveyed to consumers, this rulemaking will still greatly improve their abilities to take control of their health and wellbeing. We are at your disposal for any input that might help TTB as the final rulemaking takes shape.   Respectfully,  \n  Cruz Avila Executive Director Alcohol Justice                   \nReferences \n1.

INTRODUCTION \nComité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) represents the wine companies in the industry and trade in the \nEuropean Union. Its members produce and market the vast majority of quality European wines, with and without \na geographical indication, and account for over 90% of European wine exports. Micr o and small and medium -\nsized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU wine sector, representing more than 9 9% of wine \ncompanies. \nIn 2024, European wines accounted for approximately 64% of the volume and 78% of the value of total U.S. wine \nimports. That year, the European Union exported an estimated €4.9 billion worth of wine to the United States . \nThis robust transatlantic trade reflects the enduring demand for European wines by US consumers.  \nCEEV thanks the US authorities for the opportunity offered to comment on Notice No. 237 (Docket No. TTB -\n2025-0002), which proposes mandatory Alcohol Facts Statements on labels of wines, distilled spirits, and malt \nbeverages. \nB. CEEV COMMENTS \nCEEV shares TTB’s commitment to enhancing consumer access to product information and promoting informed \nchoices. In this spirit, we wish to offer constructive input to ensure that any future labelling requirements take \ninto account the specific characteristics of wine and the operational context European wine exporters to the US. \nCEEV believes that certain elements of the TTB’s proposed approach should be adapted to better account for \nwine’s unique characteristics, limited label space, production variability, and the need for alignment with \ninternational practices, in order to avoi d placing disproportionate burdens on EU wine producers, particularly \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. \nIn this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: \n \n1. Digital labelling to be authorized for wine Serving Facts disclosure \nWine is an agricultural product defined by natural variations depending on the characteristics of the harvest. \nUnlike other products, wine is not made to a fixed recipe and its nutritional composition, especially sugar and \ntherefore calorie content, can fluctuate significantly depending on climate conditions, fermentation choices, and \nvintage conditions and cannot be known until shortly before the wine is bottled.  \n \nMandatory physical nutritional labelling would place a disproportionate burden on producers, particularly small \nCEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  \nNotice No. 237 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the \nLabeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages   \n \n \nand medium -sized European wineries where wine is often produced in limited batches, with labels printed \nbefore final composition is confirmed. Requiring precise data would mean repeated testing and reprinting, \nadding significant cost and complexity. For many European wine producers, these obligations could be financially \nunmanageable and may discourage exports to the US, reducing diversity and choice. \n \nWine labels already carry substantial mandatory information, such as origin, varietal, vintage, and legal \ndesignations, within limited space. Imposing additional standardized panels would further constrain label design \nand potentially compromise product identity. \n \nIn this context, electronic labelling offers a practical and effective solution for communicating nutritional \ninformation to consumers, particularly in the case of wine. Digital tools such as QR codes printed on the bottle \nenable producers to provide detailed, accurate, and multilingual information in a format that is both accessible \nand adaptable. Consumers can instantly access this content using their smartphones, allowing for a more \ninformative experience without compromising the visual integrity or cultural identity of the label. \nFor EU wine exporters to the United States, electronic labelling significantly reduces the logistical and financial \nburden associated with traditional on-label disclosures. It allows updates to be made without reprinting labels—\nan essential advantage in a sector in which 99% of companies in the EU are micro, small, or medium -sized \nenterprises. \n \nDigital labelling also supports broader policy objectives, including sustainability and accessibility. It reduces \npackaging waste, enables real -time updates, and facilitates access to product information for persons with \ndisabilities. It also responds to evolving consumer expectations for digital transparency and allows producers to \nshare additional context, such as production methods or responsible consumption messages, without \ncompromising essential label elements. \n \nThis approach is already established:  \n- In the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2021/2117  permits wine and aromati zed wine products  to \ndisclose, under certain conditions, mandatory nutritional and ingredient information electronically. \n- Codex Guidelines on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling (CXG 105-2024) \nalso consider that mandatory information particulars could be provided to consumers using technology \nsuch as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. \n \nCEEV requests the TTB to recogni ze electronic labelling as a valid means of compliance for wine Serving Facts. \nSuch recognition would appropriately consider wine and wine production specificities, promote regulatory \ncoherence between major wine -producing regions and facilitate smoother trade flows while supporting \ninformed consumer choice. \n \n2. Serving Facts – title, content and tolerance \nSince their introduction in 2013, the existing voluntary requirements for providing nutritional information have \nused the heading “Serving Facts”.  For consistency reasons, CEEV believes that this heading shall not be replaced \nwith the title “Alcohol Facts”  as proposed in NPRM 237.  \n \nConcerning the content of the Serving Facts, CEEV welcomes the fact that TTB is proposing a content of a \nnutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what is required for other food \nproducts.  \n \nCEEV welcomes the proposed 20% tolerance level proposed by the TTB for nutritional declaration as it will allow \nthe use of typical values for the nutrition declaration.  \n  \nFinally, CEEV seeks assurance that, considering the proposed tolerance and the minimal presence of fats and  \n \n \nproteins in wine, producers will be permitted either to list these components as “0 grams” thereby avoiding \nthe expense of laboratory analysis for these two substances. CEEV also suggest TTB to authorize operators to \ninclude a single statement such as “Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the \nStatement instead of the “0 grams” indication on the table. \n \n3. Alcohol content statement  \nCEEV supports the communication of alcohol content for all alcoholic beverages.  \nCEEV requests the TTB not to require alcohol content to be expressed in fluid ounces per serving, in order to \nprevent consumer confusion and support harmonization with international wine labeling practices. Both \nnational wine laws and international standar ds, such as those of the OIV, states that alcohol content be \ncommunicated as ABV. Consumers are accustomed to this format across global wine markets and can readily \ninterpret the information provided. \n \n4. Implementation period \nCEEV is in favor of the planned five-year phase-in period as an appropriate timing to allow wine companies to \nadapt to the new rules. \n \n5. Certificate of Label Approval applications \nConsidering the variability of wine,  CEEV is in favor of the proposed exemption from requiring new COLA when \nthe only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required Serving Facts statement.

The U-label by Scantrust platform was specifically designed to \nprovide economic operators with a reliable and fully compliant solution to meet the latest \nEU requirements on ingredient and nutritional labeling (Regulation (EU) 2021/2117). \nEuropean wine and spirits associations support our solution and assist our teams with \nregulatory monitoring. This partnership ensures full compliance for our clients in meeting \nEuropean and national labeling requirements for wine and spirits. \nScantrust has also expanded its expertise in traceability and anti-counterfeiting systems. \nOur mission is to facilitate access to clear, complete, and reliable information for all \nconsumers, especially in highly regulated sectors such as wine, spirits, food, cosmetics, \nchemicals, and pharmaceuticals. \nPurpose \nThis contribution aims to support the authorization of digital labeling (e.g., via QR codes or \ndigital links) as an acceptable alternative or complement to physical labeling under the \nTTB’s proposed regulations for alcoholic beverage labeling. \nWe believe that the digital solution is fully aligned with the TTB's goals to: \n● Increase product transparency and information to consumers, \n● Provide access to reliable, up-to-date, comprehensive information that \nadapts to regulatory changes (including international ones), \n● Enhance consumer choice, \n● Harmonize labeling standards \nFunctional and Economic Benefits of Digital Labeling \n1) Regulatory compliance \nDigital labeling ensures compliance with labeling regulations across different \ncountries and/or regions of the world and allows adapting products already present \non the market to new regulations. As a concrete example of this, when Italy and \nSpain have enforced, in 2023 and 2025 respectively, new labeling regulations requiring all products to show clear packaging sorting and recycling instructions, \nusers of the U-label by Scantrust solution were able to add these new requirements \nto their digital labels, including to their already existing labels, and show this new \ncontent whenever the QR code is scanned in Italy or in Spain specifically. Reprinting \nof physical labeling elements was not necessary due to the dynamic nature of the \ncontent served and accessed with a QR code printed on labels. \nMore generally speaking, users of the U-label by Scantrust solution benefit from \nstrong expertise and guidance on how to be compliant with the different labeling \nregulations (both existing and future), how to present the information to ensure full \ncompliance, etc. thanks to our partnership with the European wine and spirits \nassociations. The acceptance of delivery of mandatory particulars by way of digital \nmeans as permitted by regulation has been successful in terms of implementation \nand positive sentiment. There is a strong argument for a similar approach and \nregulatory support by the TTB.   \n2) Instant data updates \nDigital labels allow real-time updates of information such as nutrition declaration \nand ingredients list without having to reprint labels or recall products. This also \nmeans that producers can instantly correct any mistake or inaccuracy in a digital \nlabel, at no cost, and with minimum effort. Correcting a mistake on physical labels \ntypically entails a problematic and costly process. \nProcess-wise, labels with QR codes can be printed even before the content of the \nbottle is finalized (i.e. at any stage of the production process, even before the final \ningredient list and nutritional values are known), which, in the case of wine and \naromatized wine products, is often necessary. Unlike other products, wine is not \nmade according to a fixed recipe. Its nutritional content depends on many factors \nand evolves all along the production and maturation processes, meaning that its \nfinal nutritional facts are not known until it is bottled. Thanks to digital labeling, \nproducers can anticipate the labeling process by printing their labels in advance, \nthen simply updating the digital label content with accurate information when the \nbottles are marketed – or at any point afterwards. \n3) Cost reduction and efficiency \nA single QR code can dynamically direct consumers to specific content based on \ntheir location and local regulations. This reduces complexity and printing costs for \nproducers, especially those exporting to multiple, disparate markets. \n \n4) Extended and enriched information \nDigital platforms mean that provision of mandatory or ancillary product particulars \nare not limited by physical space on a label. More detailed product information can \nbe provided: origin, certifications, sustainability, risks, etc. Information can also be \nprovided in a more consumer-friendly way. Including all relevant information on the physical back label of a bottle would mean either affixing awkward folded labels or \nreducing the font size to such a minimum that legibility is compromised. None of \nthose are concerns with a digital delivery. \n \n5) Multilingual access \nDigital labelling allows producers to provide information in various languages, \nthanks to integrated standardized translation, ensuring that consumers can access \naccurate information in their preferred language. This feature facilitates \ninternational market access for U.S. wine producers that are just as concerned with \nproviding their customers with all relevant product details as they are with being in \ncompliance with local regulatory frameworks.  \n \n6) Accessibility and inclusiveness \nQR codes, when combined with mobile accessibility features (screen readers, voice \nassistants, AQR), provide improved access for blind or visually impaired users, while \ntraditional labels fail to effectively meet these users’ needs. \nLegibility of printed labels is a salient challenge too. According to a widely cited \nstructured experiment published in 2011, 61% of consumers presented with some \nsample food labels reported that nutrition information was too small to read. This \nseems consistent with what we know about near-vision changes with age. \nSystematic reviews estimate that 83-89% of US adults over 45 years old have \npresbyopia (PubMed), meaning they have difficulty reading small letters at near \ndistances without correction. \nFor consumers with serious vision impairment, physical labels are often totally \nunusable. In the US alone, this concerns millions of people: about 7 million people (6 \nmillion with vision loss and 1 million blind), according to CDC’s Vision and Eye \nHealth Surveillance System). For these consumers, digital labeling is an opportunity \nto access product information, thanks to screen readers, zoom, high contrast, and \ntext-to-speech functionalities. \nOn the Issue of Universal Access \nSmartphone penetration currently exceeds 85% in developed countries such as the \nUnited States. \nAccording to Pew Research Center’s latest Mobile Fact Sheet published in 2024, \n91% of US adults own a smartphone. Even within lower-income households (below \n$30,000), a large majority of adults (79%) own a smartphone, with 28% of them \nrelying on their device for internet access as opposed to a desktop with home \nbroadband access. A recent AARP survey, updated in November 2024, reports that nine out of ten \nAmericans own a smartphone with 89% of Americans over 50 owning a \nsmartphone, compared to 90% among those aged 18-49. \nThe recommendation is that digital labels are accessed using QR codes as they do \nnot require any specific app—only the camera function or listing of a URL is needed. \nPhysical label content may be damaged or unreadable, making digital tools an \nequivalent or even superior alternative. \nConsistency with international (EU) regulation \nAuthorizing digital labeling in the US would align with the European Union’s \nregulatory approach. Since December 2023, the EU requires the disclosure of \nnutritional values and ingredients for wine and aromatized wine marketed in the EU \nand explicitly allows this to be done through digital labels  using QR codes. Aligning \nthe TTB approach with the EU would provide a harmonized and practical solution \nfor export-oriented producers, while significantly reducing compliance costs. Such \nregulatory harmonization would support international trade, avoid redundant \nlabeling, lower costs for operators, and foster cooperation between major markets. \nIt would also improve predictability for businesses operating in both the U.S. and \nthe EU. \nConclusion \nDigital labeling is a preferred alternative to a strict physical label only policy \nregarding delivery of mandatory particulars for wine and alcohol products. It \nensures immediate, persistent, and universal access to information, which is \nparticularly beneficial for products subject to multiple regulations, and for small-\nscale and/or export-oriented producers. \nData consistently shows high and rising smartphone access in the United States, \neven among older and lower-income adults, seriously undermining the critique that \ndigital information is not readily available to all. Physical labeling limitations are \nalso increasingly acknowledged, i.e. with widespread near-vision and sight \nimpairments that make small prints hard – or impossible – to read and the risk of \nlabel damage that contributes to illegibility or information loss.  \nFor all the above, we kindly request TTB to recognize digital labeling as a valid \nmeans of regulatory compliance for wine and alcohol labeling. Digital labels offer \nprecision, cost-effectiveness, inclusivity, and adaptability—key principles of modern \nregulation.

Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2013) \n2. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2016) \n3.

We respectfully urge TTB to consider the \nconsumer benefits and efficiencies offered by e -labelling when evaluating new labelling \nrequirements. \nWine has many unique characteristics that derive from the fact that it is not a recipe product, it is \nan agricultural product grown and produced with each annual vintage having unique impacts on \nthe finished pro duct. These characteristics create special challenges for wine producers when \nconsidering new labelling requirements such as the ones proposed in No. 237. Technologies such \nas QR codes enable producers to manage the variations of each annual harvest (and its impact \non nutritional content) while providing accurate, up-to-date information with limited disruption to \ntheir operations . The vast majority of global wine producers  are small and medium sized \ncompanies and this approach is particularly valuable in helping to reduce compliance costs \nwithout compromising consumer access to information. \nIn the European Union, wine producers are already permitted to communicate certain mandatory \ninformation—such as ingredients and nutritional data —via QR codes. FIVS supports a balanced \napproach, recognizing that some mandatory information (e.g., allergen w arnings) should remain on the physical label. E -labelling is not a replacement but a complement to physical labels, \nenhancing consumer understanding and choice through modern, accessible means. \nThank you for your consideration.  \nJulie Hesketh-Laird \n \nCEO \nFIVS \n \nATTACHMENT: FIVS Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling \n \n \n \n1 \n \nGood Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) \n14 March 2025 \nThe following sets forth principles and best practices policymakers should consider when \nallowing the use of electronic means for the presentation of voluntary and mandatory labelling \ninformation to consumers.   \nThese principles and best practices build on two previous sets of FIVS ’ “\nPrinciples to Enhance \nCoherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine ” and reflect growing trends i n the voluntary or \nmandatory disclosure of information via electronic means beyond what is included on the \nphysical wine label.  For the purposes of this document, “e-labelling”, “digital means” or “digital \npresentation” refer to  the voluntary or mandatory 1 disclosure of information via electronic \nmeans such as using a scannable code that creates a bridge from the physical label to the e-\nlabel. \nUse of technology to provide for  the digital presentation of some mandatory information is an \nemerging area particularly relevant to wine producers. Wine is not a recipe or formula product.  \nIn contrast with other food products, the ingredients and related nutritional values in wine can \nvary from vintage to vintage due to variations in climate and grape growing conditions.  In some \ncases, ﬁnal ingredients may not be known until just before bottling whereas the physical label is \ndesigned and typically printed months in advance of bottling due to the regulatory nature of key \ninformation on wine labels and label pre -approvals required in some markets .  The use of e-\nlabels for the digital presentation of ingredients and nutrition information permits the ﬂexibility \nneeded while still enabling product accuracy.   \n \nHowever, the use of e-labels should not be restricted only to this speciﬁc and narrow use.  \nConsumers want more product information tha n can reasonably ﬁ t on physical labels and a \nsingle QR code can serve multiple purposes . In some jurisdictions, QR codes have already \nreplaced barcodes at the retail level\n2 and technology exists for the use of a single QR code to \ntransmit different information depending on the type of scanner used.   \n \nHere are just a few examples of the type of information currently accessible via a single QR code \nas well as potential future uses.  \n \n• Consumers - voluntary product details, sustainability information, product recalls, and \nmore. \n• Retailers - point of sale pricing, stocking, and inventory information. \n• Government Officials - mandatory regulatory information, recycling information, and \nexport documentation.  \n \n \n1 For the purposes of this document, mandatory refers to disclosures that regulations require. \n2 What is GS1 Sunrise 2027? | GS1 US.  \n \n \n2 \n \nQR codes are the most common digital means being used at this time to connect to an e-label.  \nWhile future advancements in technology may lead to replacement s for QR code s, these  \nprinciples will still apply to the use of such replacements. \n1. Use of e -labelling to provide information to wine consumers : \nGovernments should permit the use of e- labelling to provide \ninformation to consumers.   \nRecent work in both Codex Alimentarius3 and the International Organi sation of Vine  and Wine \n(OIV) 4  illustrates the growing trend of the use of e-labels to provide some mandatory information \nfor food products, including wine. The following are just a few of the reasons that support the ir \nuse: \n• Rapidly increasing global penetration of smartphones; \n• Widespread and growing consumer use of QR codes to access information; \n• Consumer demand for more product transparency; \n• Reduced waste consistent with wine industry sustainability goals as the use of e -labels \nreduces label re-prints; \n• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired; and \n• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer - in real time - which is \nnot possible using physical labels.  \n2. Presentation of certain mandatory information  using digital \nmeans: Governments should  allow the presentation of certain \nmandatory information via e-labels.     \nThe European Union (EU) recently took this approach for ingredient and nutrition labelling of \nwine and aromatized wine products5 as did Italy6 and Spain7 for recycling information8 and other \ncountries are assessing the introduction of their use in national legislation. \n \n3Guidelines for the use of Technology to Provide Food Information in Food Labeling as agreed to at the 47th Session \nof the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)). \n4 The recently updated “OIV International Standard for Labelling of Wines-e-label, nutrient declaration, information \nabout ingredients” (amended by resolution ECO DROCON 20-6 76) incorporates many of the FIVS principles. Note \nespecially the ability to use a language -free modality: “The direct link to the e -label indicated on the label may be \nclearly identiﬁed through language free presentation modalities, a pictogram or a symbol easily visible and clear to \nunderstand by consumers.” \n5 EU Regulation 1308/2018, article 119(4).  \n6 Italian Ministerial Decree n. 360 from 28 September 2022 and Implementation Guidelines. \n7 Spanish Royal Decree (RD) 1055/2022 and Spanish Ministry for Environment Interpretative Note. \n  \n \n \n3 \n \nThe range of possible uses of QR codes to present some information digitally is expected to \nexpand over time. Governments should remain flexible and open to allowing digital presentation \nof certain mandatory information as appropriate.    \nThe same general principles of food labelling regulation such as legibility, truthfulness, and \naccuracy should apply whe ther mandatory information is presented on a physical label or via \ndigital means.  \nThese principles recognize that some mandatory information will  always be on the physical \nlabel, such as for allergens. A digital label does not replace, but rather supplements, a physical \nlabel. \n3. Use of QR codes to communicate other, voluntary information: \nGovernments should  permit additional, voluntary information to \nbe presented via e-labels.   \nThe same QR code that links to mandatory information should also be permitted to link to \nvoluntary information, p rovided that  it is presented separately and distinctly from the \nmandatory information.  \nIt may be appropriate to allow producers to include a link on the e -label at the end of the \nmandatory information inviting consumers to “click here” should  they desire access to \nadditional voluntary information.   \n4. The number  of QR codes on a given label should be \nminimized: Governments should permit a single QR code on a \nwine label to serve more than one purpose.  \nA single QR code has nearly unlimited uses. \nIn some jurisdictions, a single QR code is already being used for product pricing at the point of \nsale, to convey mandatory EU nutrition and ingredient requirements for wine, and to \ncommunicate EU Member State specific recycling requirements. \nIn the United States, many food and beverage companies use a single QR code on a voluntary \nbasis to provide information about ingredients, nutrition, and how to properly recycle the \nproduct based on the consumer’s location\n9.  \n \n9 SmartLabel: the leading platform for savvy shoppers to ﬁnd more information than can ﬁt on a package about \nthousands of food and beverage, personal care, household, pet care, dietary supplements, and OTC products.  \n \n \n4 \n \nAllowing a single QR code for voluntary and mandatory purposes will maximize its benefit and \nwill avoid confusion about which QR code to scan for additional information. \n5. Acceptance of standalone QR codes to c onvey information: \nGovernments should refrain from requiring additional text on the \nphysical label to identify the information accessible via the QR \ncode. \nQR Codes provide for a language -free system of conveying important information and \nconsumers are comfortable scanning the codes to access that information.    \nUsing terms next to the QR code to identify the information on the e-label should be avoided  \nbecause: \n• As the use of QR codes expands , the number of possible terms and languages \nneeded to correctly identify the content will proliferate. \n• Text, or other design elements, too close or within the QR code can corrupt the code \nrisking its readability10 \nIf it is deemed essential to identify the mandatory information accessible via the QR code , a \nglobally recognized, language-free symbol or pictogram should be utilized.  However, this must \nnot interfere with the ability to successfully scan the code. \n6. Expiration of e -labels: When mandatory information is \nprovided via an e -label, governments should not require that \nthe information remain accessible longer than the wine is \nordinarily intended for consumption.  \nCodex Alimentarius recently agreed to “Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food \nInformation in Food Labelling11 that address the timeframe for which producers are expected to \nensure that information that is accessed via QR codes remains available.  The Guidelines apply \nto pre-packaged foods, including wine.  \nGovernments are requested to refer to the Guidelines rather than implementing new or \ndivergent requirements .  H owever, consideration should be given to adapting them in the \n \n10 ISO/IEC 18004:2024(en), Information technology — Automatic identiﬁcation and data capture techniques — QR \ncode bar code symbology speciﬁcation- S ee 5.3.8 “Quiet Zone” that designates the clear space needed \nsurrounding the QR code to separate it from nearby design elements or markings to ensure the QR codes \nreadability. \n11Guidelines for the use of Technology to Provide Food Information in Food Labeling as agreed to at the 47th \nSession of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)).  \n \n \n5 \n \ncontext of long shelf-life products such as wine to focus on the time period for which the product \nis ordinarily intended for consumption. \nThe final Guidelines at section 7.5 state, “Where mandatory food information is solely provided \nusing technology, the food information shall be available for at least the period, established \nunder intended conditions of distribution, storage, retail and use, that the food would remain \nsafe and suit able for sale, consumption or use. For pre- packaged food that is labelled with a \nuse-by date or expiration date, this means for at least the period up to and including this date.” \n7. E-labels should comply with applicable data  privacy laws:   \nIn formulating regulations for the e-labelling of food products, \ngovernments should take fully into consideration any existing \nand applicable data privacy laws. \nMany countries, including those that allow the use of e-labe ls, have data privacy laws in place \nto protect consumer data or prohibit its collection without affirmative consent. Thus, \ngovernments should remain mindful of these laws to avoid duplication, contradiction, or overly \nrestrictive rules specific to e-labelling.   \n8. Harmonized approach: Governments should work towards a \nharmonized international understanding concerning the types of \ninformation that must appear on the physical label of a wine bottle \nand that which may appear on an e-label.   \nWine is traded all around the world and e-labelling technology is already being used in multiple \nmarkets.   \nIn order to facilitate international trade, g overnments are requested to remain flexible in their \napproach and to consider the best practices already in place in key wine producing markets \nbefore developing regulations in this area.

Ryan \nAdministrator  \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \nAlcohol Labeling and Formulation Division  \n1310 G Street, NW, Box 12  \nWashington, DC  20005 \n \nRe: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  \n(RIN 1513–AC93) \n \nDear Administrator Ryan: \n \nOn behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I \nappreciate the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (ATTB) \nproposed rule entitled “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt \nBeverages” (RIN 1513–AC93). We commend the ATTB for its thorough review and recognizing the \nimportance of transparency for consumers on serving size and ingredient contents. As the body of \nscientific evidence grows on the impact of alcohol on health conditions such as cancer, it is imperative to \nmake this information available in an easy to comprehend format.  \n \nSince 2013, alcohol companies have printed versions of a facts label on some of their products. This \nvoluntary action lacks uniform guidance, visuals, content, or graphic depictions, and often uses terms like \n“no added sugar” or “gluten free.” These could be interpreted as suggesting that alcoholic beverages have \nnutritional value. The AMA commends the ATTB for promulgating rules with mandatory label \nrequirements that provide consumers with consistent information across products. \n \nThe AMA has long-standing policies on the impact of alcohol consumption on health and restrictions on \nmarketing alcohol to adolescents. Provisions in this rule align with AMA’s initiatives to improve \nconsumer access to reliable health information. The AMA generally supports many of the proposals in \nthis rule and offers some additional recommendations that would further advance consumer protections \nwhen it comes to consuming alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) products, including requiring that alcohol fact \nstatements include a warning about the link between alcohol and cancer, as outlined in greater detail \nbelow.  \n \nNutritional Information  \n \nThe AMA agrees with the ATTB’s proposed mandatory requirement of a uniform alcohol facts \nlabel that includes a standard set of information across all alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. It \nis important for consumers to understand the health impacts of these beverages and be able to compare \nbeverage choices.  \n \nThe AMA supports ATTB’s proposal that mandatory nutrient information statement on labels must \ninclude the following information: serving size, servings per container, alcohol content as a percentage of The Honorable Mary G. Ryan \nAugust 14, 2025 \nPage 2 \n \n \n  \nalcohol by volume and per serving size, calories per serving, and carbohydrates and fat per serving. This \nnutrient information will provide consumers with valuable information about how the products they are \nconsuming will impact their diet and overall health, just as the nutritional facts label does with food \nproducts. This is especially important as the selection of alcoholic beverages marketed to consumers has \nevolved in recent years to include products that are high in added sugars and other additives. For example, \nready-to drink cocktails are among the fastest growing category of spirits, with sales revenue in the U.S. \ngrowing by 26.8 percent from 2022 to 2023.1   \n \nThe ATTB proposes allowing sugar content statements as an optional element and does not propose to \ninclude sodium or cholesterol because they are generally present in small amounts in alcoholic beverages. \nThe AMA believes that sugars, sodium, and cholesterol should be mandatory elements on the \nalcohol facts label. To align the alcohol facts label with the nutrition facts label and provide consumers \nwith essential and comprehensive information, sugars, including those that are added, are an essential \ncomponent. Sugars contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and can exacerbate \nexisting CVD. Alcoholic beverages can also contain high levels of carbohydrates and sodium. For \nconsumers to successfully limit these nutrients, as recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines, this \ninformation must be accessible on labels.  \n \nThe AMA supports consistent labeling requirements for “non-alcoholic” or “zero proof” beverages \nthat are manufactured, packaged, or marketed in a manner similar to alcoholic beverages. \nRequiring that these products have the same alcohol facts labeling requirements will contribute to \nincreased consumer awareness about the dietary impact of these products, which are increasingly \nbecoming a popular replacement for alcohol products.1 Non-alcoholic beverages are also attractive to \nadolescents when marketed as an alternative to alcohol with the same taste.2 This labeling consistency is \nimportant for adolescents to build good habits comparing this type of nutrition information. \n \nThe ATTB proposes to allow for the optional presentation of Alcohol Facts panels in a dual-column \nformat in which the first column would provide the information for the standard reference serving size, \nwhile the second column would provide information about the contents of the entire container. The AMA \nbelieves there would be value in making this mandatory. The dual-column format would provide \nimportant contextual information and ensure that consumers would be familiar with this format as it \nwould be consistent with nutrition facts label requirements.  \n \nTitle and Display \n \nThe ATTB is considering both “Serving Facts” and “Alcohol Facts” as options for the title of the label. \nThe AMA recommends that the ATTB use the “Alcohol Facts” title. This title uses the same naming \nconvention as the Nutrition Facts label. ATTB could take advantage of existing consumer awareness \nabout the use and benefit of such labels by adapting the education and dissemination strategies deployed \nby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and public health groups including the AMA.3  \n \n \n1 Research and Markets.

Ryan \nAugust 14, 2025 \nPage 3 \n \n \n  \nThe AMA understands that the ATTB considered allowing the Alcohol Facts panel to be distributed by \nelectronic means that would allow for limiting the information printed on the product label. The AMA \nrecommends that the ATTB not allow this form of distribution at the expense of complete and \nthorough information on the product itself. While QR codes and websites can be a useful way to \nprovide more detailed nutritional information than traditional labels, research suggests that many \nconsumers may not actively use them—due to factors such as convenience, usability, perceived value, \nand online accessibility.4,5 The AMA supports the ATTB’s decision to instead require that this \ninformation be directly displayed on the product label itself. \n \nTo support greater consumer comprehension of the purpose of an alcohol facts label, the AMA \nrecommends the use of a panel as opposed to linear format. Panel-style ingredient labels are \nconsistently easier for consumers to read and understand, regardless of the type of product, due to their \nstructured and standardized layout6 and consumers are already familiar with this format due to the \nnutrition facts label. \n \nATTB is proposing that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements mirror existing \ntype size requirements for mandatory information in the wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverage \nregulations. The AMA supports evidence-based minimum type size requirements to ensure the \ninformation is presented in a clear, legible format to consumers. The AMA also calls for alcohol \nlabeling presented with sufficient prominence, legibility, and design features, such as minimum font size, \nand color contrast, and optional pictorial elements, to enhance readability and support informed decision-\nmaking across populations. To this end, the AMA recommends that the ATTB utilize a multifaceted \nqualitative evaluation process including consumer focus groups to understand which design \nelements are most effective at relaying key information on alcohol beverages. Upon completion of \nthis evaluative process, the ATTB should release guidance/examples and possible rulemaking with \nadditional requirements based on these findings, such as required color schemes and/or pictorial elements. \nThe FDA employed this process in the creation of final regulations for front-of-package nutrition labeling \nand tobacco warning labels. Both were shaped by rigorous, evidence-based research, including consumer \nfocus groups, to ensure clear and effective health communication. The FDA relied on this body of \nresearch to inform its regulations and guidance that empower consumers to make informed decisions and \nadvance population health outcomes.  \n \nCompliance Date \n \nCMS proposes a compliance deadline of five years from the date of publication in the Federal Register. \nWhile the AMA understands the desire to allow a reasonable runway, particularly for small \nmanufacturers, to come into compliance, we believe five years is an unnecessarily long time and would \nrecommend an alternative deadline of two or three years to come into compliance with the rule, which we \nbelieve would provide more than adequate time for suppliers to come into compliance. In any case, ATTB \nshould not finalize a deadline of any longer than five years.  \n \nAdditional Recommendations \n \nThe AMA supports the addition of the following warning statement: “There is no safe amount of \nalcohol consumption, and consuming alcohol in any amount increases the risk of cancer and other \n \n4 Gaudeul, A., & Krawczyk, M.

These reports were \nassigned by the Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as the evidence \nbase needed to develop alcohol consumption recommendations in the final 2025 guidelines.7,8 \nObservational and meta-analysis reviews have all confirmed the known link between alcohol \nconsumption and cancers.9,10 Despite additional evidence presented in the U.S. Surgeon General’s \nAdvisory on Alcohol and Cancer Risk, less than half of U.S. adults are aware of the link between alcohol \nuse and cancer.11,12 Ideally, this warning statement would be placed on the front of package label. In \naddition to package labeling, the AMA recommends clear, evidence-based point-of-sale warning signage \nin physical and digital retail environments. \n \nLastly, the AMA strongly supports ongoing research and evaluation into the impact of alcohol warning \nlabels on consumer knowledge and behavior, health outcomes, and alcohol sales patterns, particularly \nacross sub-populations, and that alcohol labeling standards be updated based on the latest in evolving \nevidence about what consumer education strategies are most effective.  \n \nIn Conclusion \n \nOverall, the AMA strongly supports the creation of an alcohol facts statement, which will lead to greater \nconsumer understanding about the associated dietary and health impacts of consuming alcoholic products. \nWe welcome further opportunities to collaborate with the ATTB as it works towards finalization and \nimplementation of these new requirements which will help empower Americans to more easily compare \nproducts and make well-informed decisions.

0,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'I am in complete agreement with this proposed rule. It is only fair that alcoholic beverages like every other beverage and food item on the market contain per-serving information about calories, nutrients, and, when necessary, alcohol content. The reasons why I believe this proposed rule should go into effect are the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcoholic consumption, and the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are drinking. Firstly, this proposed rule is beneficial because of the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages like everything else we consume contain calories and if too many calories are consumed every day it can lead to weight gain, which we already have too much of in this country as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ldquo;on a given day, consumers of alcoholic beverages obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from alcoholic beverages&rdquo; (Nielsen et al, 2012). Assuming the consumers follow the recommendation of 2,000 calories a day that would equal 320 calories from alcoholic beverages every day. Without the proper labeling, consumers cannot know exactly how many calories they are consuming, making it extremely difficult to follow the recommended daily caloric intake if they are trying to follow it. Secondly, this proposed rule should go into effect because the United States is known to be an obese country with around 40% of adults being obese (Emmerich et al, 2024), as well as some research showing increases in obesity and heavy alcohol consumption in adults in the United States. Between 2017-2020 the combination of heavy alcohol consumption and obesity was 3.1% of adults in the United States which is up from 1.8% in 1999-2000, and it has increased 72% over time (Raza et al, 2023). That shows that not only is obesity and heavy alcohol consumption linked, but it is also on the rise. It very well could be on the rise because of the lack of consistent labeling on alcoholic beverages that do not always include the caloric value which can lead to an overconsumption of calories which in turn can cause obesity. Finally, this proposed rule should go into effect because of the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are consuming. When there is no consistent labeling among alcoholic beverages it can lead to confusion or if there is a lack of any labeling it can lead consumers to be uninformed about what they are consuming. A study of college students showed that 65% were unaware of the caloric content of the alcoholic beverages they consumed (Lloyd-Richardson et al, 2008). 65% of college students not knowing the caloric content of their alcoholic beverages is astronomically too high and this proposed rule could help lower that number by a large margin. Also, another study suggests that alcohol labeling can be effective in increasing consumers&#39; knowledge and understanding of the health risks involved in drinking alcoholic beverages (Edmunds et al, 2023). Just knowing the risks will not stop people from consuming alcoholic beverages, but it will allow them to make informed decisions moving forward, which could allow consumers to live healthier lives. Being informed about what is consumed is extremely important and is already in place for every other consumable good so it only makes sense to hold alcoholic beverages to the same standards. In conclusion, the caloric content of alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcohol consumption, and the benefit of increased information on alcoholic beverages are all reasons why I believe this proposed rule should become regulation under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.<br/>References: Edmunds, C.

Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \nComment for Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and \nMalt Beverages \nDear Director, \nAs the CEO of a major import and distributing company, working with hundreds of small wine \nproducers on every continent around the globe, we respectfully submit our opposition to the proposed \nAlcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. \nSince the beginning of wine making (probably dating back 7000 years), wine has been made in very \nmuch the same way. It is important to note that most wine is 85% biologically pure water, taken up \nthrough the roots and delivered to the grapes on the vine. The remaining 15% is made up essentially of \nalcohol, plus minute quantities of organic acids, sugars, minerals and tannins. \nTo analyze the minute quantities that might be considered nutritional in the wine would be a huge \nburden for the many small producers we represent. Each producer makes many different wines, some in \nvery small quantities; a separate analysis would have to be done for each individual wine, leading to a \nprohibitive burden in terms of both time and cost. This is time and money that most wineries simply do \nnot have. Additionally, the American consumer would not realty benefit from the nutritional information \n— if any— which would result from such analyses and labeling. \nIn conclusion: We already have so many regulations regarding labeling; adding this will just burden the \nindustry further, without really enlightening the American consumer. \nThank you for giving us the opportunity to share our thoughts. We hope you will give serious \nconsideration to our objections. \nSincerely, \nMordy Herzog, CEO \nRoyal Wine Corporation \n'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0090,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-09 15:34:41,,False,Comment 87:  Royal Wine Corp.,0900006486a8153e,2025-04-09 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,See Attached,m9a-2wid-o96u,,Comment(s),0,,,Bayonne,NJ,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-04-09 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:14,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths per year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths were among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need to intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and treatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-building and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve monitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve capacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). \n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing additional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled spirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling was not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 report on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is Notice No. 237. \xa0The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes calorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to know about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, religious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement of alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required to have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB published Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were February 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on labeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions was 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening sessions.\xa0Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, the original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025.\xa0\n\nBackground\n\n     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by the TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not finalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which means there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory calorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.

Occasionally, I will drink liquor or a wine cooler but, I \nhave never read or noticed any caloric information about the alcoholic beverage.  Even if there \nwas harmful information about the beverage being cancerous or increasing heart rate, I never \nnoticed a label. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths \nper year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths \nwere among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need \nto intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and \ntreatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-\nbuilding and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve \nmonitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve \ncapacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). \n     An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the \nTreasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing \nadditional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled \nspirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling \nwas not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 \nreport on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol \ncontent, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is \nNotice No. 237.  The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes \ncalorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to \nknow about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, \nreligious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement \nof alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required \nto have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB \npublished Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were \nFebruary 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on \nlabeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions \nwas 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening \nsessions. Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, \nthe original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025. \nBackground\n     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by \nthe TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not \nfinalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which \nmeans there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory \ncalorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.  Plus, the “Serving Facts” would \ninclude the number of servings per container and serving size.      Since TTB did not finalize the rulemaking, on May 28, 2013, TTB published TTB Ruling \n2013-2, Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. In this ruling, “Serving Facts” statement could be on a \nvoluntary basis.  As a result, in the fall of 2017, TTB withdrew the “Serving Facts” rulemaking \nfrom the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Four years later, \nseveral consumer groups and public health advocates urged TTB to finalize the “Serving Facts” \nrulemaking in the “2021 CSPI letter”.  In other words, these consumer groups and public health \nadvocates demanded a response. These consumer groups included the Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest (CSPI), Alcohol Justice, the American Institute for Cancer Research, Breast \nCancer Prevention Partners, the Consumer Federation of America, the National Consumers \nLeague, and the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.

In short, the second tier of beverages containing more than 7% alcohol by volume (ABV) and up to 16% ABV, which currently assigned a serving size of 5 fl oz in the proposal, should have a serving size of 12 oz because this reflects the way in which such beverages are typically consumed, i.e., in 12 fl oz bottles or cans. As TTB&rsquo;s proposal stands, only malt beverages containing 7% or less ABV are assigned a serving size of 12 fl oz. This prevents apples-to-apples comparison of such products at retail, obscuring alcohol content on a by-the-bottle (or can) basis, which is how people generally consume such beverages.<br/><br/>According to beeradvocate.com, a beer connoisseur and review website with tens of thousands of users and in operation since 1996, of the top ten &ldquo;Most Popular Beers,&rdquo; eight have over 7% ABV. The remaining two have exactly 7% ABV. https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/popular/. All of these ten are commonly or exclusively sold in sizes of at least 12 fl oz. Though beeradvocate.com focuses on craft beers which often have higher ABV than is typical for beer and which may not reflect the most mainstream alcohol consumption habits, craft breer still accounts for a large amount of alcohol consumption. According to the Brewers Association, in 2024, craft brewers produced 23.1 million barrels of beer which accounted for 13.3% of the overall U.S. beer market. https://www.brewersassociation.org/association-news/brewers-association-reports-2024-u-s-craft-brewing-industry-figures/.

Both are predominately packaged in and consumed directly from 12 fl oz bottles or cans. TTB&rsquo;s proposal to establish a serving size of 5 fl oz for such beverages will only serve to confuse consumers because the consumption habits for beers in both categories are the same: drink to completion. 12 fl oz bottles and cans are not resealable and sharing of such portions is not common. <br/><br/>Because of the similar consumption habits, two 12 fl oz cans sitting side-by-side in a retail store should contain immediately comparable information, regardless of which of the two ABV categories they fall into. If one of those 12 fl oz cans is a craft beer with ABV of 7+% to 16% and the other contains less than 7% ABV, the consumer should be presented with an Alcohol Facts panel display immediately reflecting the differences at the level of the whole can or bottle. That is, they should see that the calories and alcohol content by serving are substantially different. Under TTB&rsquo;s current proposal to apply a 12 fl oz serving size to one can and a 5 fl oz serving size to the other, that would not be the case. The consumer would see information pertaining to the whole container for the lower ABV product and of a minor portion of the higher ABV product. If &ldquo;[s]erving size reference amounts are not intended as recommended consumption amounts but rather are intended to be used as a reference amount for the consumer to determine alcohol, nutrient, and calorie intake&rdquo; (quoting TTB Notice No. 237), then serving sizes should reflect common consumption amounts as they exist in practice. For beers in the 7% to 16% ABV range, that amount is 12 fl oz.<br/><br/>Finally, if a different category must be established for beers greater than 7% ABV and up to 16%, then it should be a number of fluid ounces that divides into 12 fl oz without a remainder.

0,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': ""Including sugar or carbohydrate content on alcohol labels, while seemingly informative, could be misleading because it frames sugar/carbs (carbohydrates are a sugar, after all) as the primary concern, overshadowing alcohol&rsquo;s more profound metabolic and nutritional impacts. It reinforces the false narrative that sugar/carbs are inherently worse, despite being a nutrient essential for survival. <br/><br/>Considered the following:<br/><br/>1. Public Perception: Sugar is Already Vilified<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In recent years, sugar has been intensely demonized in public discourse, largely due to its association with obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. While these concerns are valid, they have led to a disproportionate fear of sugar compared to other harmful substances, including alcohol.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If sugar content is prominently displayed on alcohol labels, consumers may incorrectly assume that a lower-sugar alcohol is &ldquo;healthier,&rdquo; ignoring the far more harmful effects of alcohol itself.<br/><br/>2. Alcohol&rsquo;s Unique Metabolic Harm<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The public often views sugar and calories as the main nutritional concerns, but alcohol has effects that far exceed those of sugar. For example:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Alcohol Suppresses Fat Burning: Even sugar doesn&rsquo;t impair fat oxidation as dramatically as alcohol does.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Toxic Byproducts: Alcohol metabolizes into acetaldehyde, a toxin, while sugar breaks down into glucose and fructose, which the body can utilize or store.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Highlighting sugar content on labels could distract from alcohol&rsquo;s inherently toxic nature and lead consumers to prioritize sugar levels over the far more significant health risks of alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>3. Alcohol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hidden&rdquo; Calories and Nutritional Impact<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Alcohol itself is calorically dense (7 calories per gram) and contributes &ldquo;empty&rdquo; calories with no nutritional benefit. These calories are metabolically disruptive, regardless of sugar content. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Low-sugar alcoholic beverages still carry the full burden of alcohol&rsquo;s toxic and caloric effects, but labeling them as &ldquo;low sugar&rdquo; could create a false sense of healthfulness.<br/><br/>4. Misleading Comparisons with Other Beverages<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In soft drinks or juices, sugar content is a key health indicator because sugar is the primary source of calories and metabolic impact.

It reinforces the false narrative that sugar/carbs are inherently worse, despite being a nutrient essential for survival. <br/><br/>Considered the following:<br/><br/>1. Public Perception: Sugar is Already Vilified<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In recent years, sugar has been intensely demonized in public discourse, largely due to its association with obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. While these concerns are valid, they have led to a disproportionate fear of sugar compared to other harmful substances, including alcohol.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If sugar content is prominently displayed on alcohol labels, consumers may incorrectly assume that a lower-sugar alcohol is &ldquo;healthier,&rdquo; ignoring the far more harmful effects of alcohol itself.<br/><br/>2. Alcohol&rsquo;s Unique Metabolic Harm<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The public often views sugar and calories as the main nutritional concerns, but alcohol has effects that far exceed those of sugar. For example:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Alcohol Suppresses Fat Burning: Even sugar doesn&rsquo;t impair fat oxidation as dramatically as alcohol does.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Toxic Byproducts: Alcohol metabolizes into acetaldehyde, a toxin, while sugar breaks down into glucose and fructose, which the body can utilize or store.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Highlighting sugar content on labels could distract from alcohol&rsquo;s inherently toxic nature and lead consumers to prioritize sugar levels over the far more significant health risks of alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>3. Alcohol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hidden&rdquo; Calories and Nutritional Impact<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Alcohol itself is calorically dense (7 calories per gram) and contributes &ldquo;empty&rdquo; calories with no nutritional benefit. These calories are metabolically disruptive, regardless of sugar content. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Low-sugar alcoholic beverages still carry the full burden of alcohol&rsquo;s toxic and caloric effects, but labeling them as &ldquo;low sugar&rdquo; could create a false sense of healthfulness.<br/><br/>4. Misleading Comparisons with Other Beverages<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In soft drinks or juices, sugar content is a key health indicator because sugar is the primary source of calories and metabolic impact. However, in alcoholic beverages, sugar is a secondary factor&mdash;alcohol is the primary source of both calories and harm.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>A sugary cocktail may appear &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than a low-sugar spirit on paper, but the spirit&rsquo;s alcohol content will have a far greater negative impact on metabolism and overall health than the sugar in the cocktail.<br/><br/>5.

American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) i s a \ntrade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in \nthe manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and \naround the world.  ADSA member companies represent over 70 percent of all distilled spirit \nsales nationwide. \nWe refer to Wine Institute, DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA \ncollectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   \n \nThe Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in  Notice No. \n237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages \n(“Notice 237”).  The comment period for Notice 237 is scheduled to end on April 17, 2025. \nThe Associa tions request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would \nextend to August 15, 2025. \n \nAs a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily \nregulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of \nthe new administration .  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in \nthe final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the \nfirst day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries \nthey regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into \nplace since Notice 237 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and \nmidsize wineries , c raft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great costs and \noperational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even \nmeaningfully participating in  the comment process means they must redirect time and \nresources. \n \nNotice 237 is expansive—i.e., 53 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10-point, single -spaced \nfont—and poses more than 90 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It \nis also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that it raises.  \nIndeed, it has been over 17 years since TTB last raised these issues and it rightly recognizes  \nPage 3 of 4 \n \nin Notice 237 that the comments received almost two decades ago “may no longer fully and \naccurately reflect the opinions ” of industry members, trade associations, and other \ninterested parties.  We agree with TTB that addressing this issue again years later necessarily \nrequires updated input  and add that the beverage alcohol landscape has fundamentally \nevolved over the past 17 years.   That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of \nthe proposed rule —including the many questions and requests fo r comments in Notice \n237—and for our members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit \nthe overall process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. \n \nIt is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 237  will \nimpact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance \nof the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey \nthe input of all our members to ensure their perspectives are included and well-reflected.  \nMoreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 237 on important but sweeping areas of interest \nsuch as comments on “ any other options available to reduce regulatory burdens and \neconomic costs while still providing the consumer with adequate information about the \nproducts in question .”  Our members will need additional time to consider other options \navailable for those purposes and then explain and discuss them in submitted comments. \n \nLast, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that \nimpact our members.  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing major food \nallergen labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same day as Notice \n237 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 237’s publication , \nthe FDA published a rulemaking proposing front-of-package labeling for nutrition which will \nalso impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 237, propose new \nrules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration.  We therefore believe a \n120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. \n \nWe would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request. \n \n[ SIGNATURES ON FOLLOWING PAGE ] \n   \nPage 4 of 4 \n \n \n  \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n \n \nRobert P.

We are commenting on the questions the TTB posed in the proposed rulemaking notice.<br/><br/>Although there has been little to no demand for nutritional information from our distributors and consumers, we understand the motivations behind the Alcohol Facts statement outlined in the proposed rulemaking. Complying with the proposed regulation would require us to incur upfront costs in terms of time and money; however, we appreciate the TTB&rsquo;s flexibility regarding nutrition labeling, COLA approval, thresholds, and nutrition testing. While we value the TTB&#39;s allowance for the alcohol facts label to be displayed linearly, utilizing a QR code would enable us to update information and align with EU labeling protocols. We are thankful for the TTB&rsquo;s implementation of a five-year period, which will save time and money in the long run. Despite the potential cost savings, the new labeling requirement would impose a minimum expense of $818,260 on our company. Thus, this proposed regulation would still present challenges for small importers and producers. Many small foreign producers struggle to comprehend US regulations and requirements, making it difficult to communicate them accurately and precisely to their production partners. This could lead to numerous errors in attempts at compliance, resulting in lost time and resources. We estimate that fulfilling the proposed regulations will increase production and transit times, as producers must invest time and resources to meet these new requirements.<br/><br/>We have attached a more detailed comment document.

R. China on United States Notification\nG/TBT/N/USA/2182\n1. The draft regulation required all alcohol beverage labels regulated by TTB to\ndisclose the alcohol content, calories, and nutritional information of each beverage in\nthe ""alcohol content"" statement. Due to the fact that alcoholic beverages are mainly\ncomposed of ethanol and water, and do not contain conventional nutrients such as\nprotein, fat, carbohydrates, etc., for example, distilled spirits almost do not contain\nthese components. If the product does not add nutritional fortifiers or make nutritional\nclaims, labeling the nutritional content table is meaningless; Fermented alcoholic\nbeverages (such as beer and fruit wine) may contain small amounts of carbohydrates,\nand it may consider adding only labeled carbohydrates as appropriate. However, beer\nlabels also require labeling malt content, therefore, labeling carbohydrates is not very\nmeaningful for consumers. For ordinary consumers, the nutritional value of alcoholic\nbeverages is limited, and labeling indicators such as carbohydrates may be misleading\n(such as implying that they have nutritional supplementation functions). The\nadditional and unnecessary laboratory analysis costs incurred are also a heavy burden\nfor producers or traders.\nAccording to the relevant standards of the CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission),\nmost countries do not require the labeling of conventional nutrients such as protein,\nfat, carbohydrates, etc. for alcoholic beverages. The provision of Regulation (EU) No\n1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Provision of Food\nInformation to Consumers concerning the ingredient list and nutrition declaration for\nalcoholic beverages with an alcohol content exceeding 1.2% is non-mandatory. When\nthe nutrition statement for alcoholic beverages is voluntarily provided, it is limited to\nenergy values only.\nBased on the principle of scientific evidence and necessity, it is recommended that the\nUnited States should coordinate its requirements for alcoholic beverage labeling with\ninternational standards, or differentiated the requirements according to the different\nproduct forms of alcoholic beverages: consider not mandating the labeling of\nconventional nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc. on ordinary alcoholic\nbeverage labels as appropriate; If additional ingredients such as sugar, juice, or other\nnutritional enhancers are added to alcoholic beverages, the carbohydrate content or\nother nutrient content may be indicated according to the actual situation. To avoid\nexcessive regulation, reduce compliance costs for businesses, and alleviate the burden\non small and medium-sized enterprises.\n2. The draft regulation required the addition of new subpart L - alcohol factual\nstatements in Parts 4, 5, and 7 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\nThe current regulations require the display of information such as alcohol content,\ncarmine, sulfite, etc. The proposed rule required an addition of alcohol factual\nstatements such as single portion size, number of portions per container, and liquid\nounces per unit of pure ethanol, and the liquid ounce information per unit of pure\nethanol should be accurate to one tenth of the liquid ounce. The provision differs from\ninternational standards and may impose additional costs and burdens on alcoholic\nbeverage manufacturers and importers, especially small businesses. It is\nrecommended that the United States should maintain the current regulations without\n3 of 4adding the provision and not mandating the labeling of information such as ""single\nportion size, number of portions per container, and number of ounces of pure ethanol\nper serving"" to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade.\nComments in Chinese are as below:\n1、 规章修订提案中要求所有受TTB 监管的酒精饮料标签“酒精含量”声明\n中必须披露每份饮料的酒精含量、 卡路里及营养成分信息。 由于酒精饮料的主要\n成分为乙醇和水， 基本不含蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素，比如蒸馏\n酒几乎不含这些成分， 若产品未添加营养强化剂或未进行营养声称， 则标示营养\n成分表毫无意义；发酵酒（如啤酒、果酒）可能含有少量碳水化合物，可以酌情\n考虑仅添加标示碳水化合物， 但啤酒标签也已要求标注麦芽度， 因此标示碳水化\n合物对于消费者也无太大意义。对普通消费者而言，酒精饮料的营养价值有限，\n标注碳水化合物等指标可能产生误导（如暗示其具有营养补充功能） 。其产生额\n外的、不必要的实验室分析费用对生产商或贸易商来说也是繁重的负担。\n根据食品法典委员会的相关标准， 国际上绝大多数国家对酒精饮料不强制要\n求标注蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物等常规营养素。欧盟（EU）第 1169/2011 号条\n例《关于向消费者提供食品信息》涉及酒精含量超过 1.2%的酒精饮料提供成分\n清单、营养声明的规定属于非强制性条款，当酒精饮料营养声明是自愿提供时，\n营养声明仅限于能量值。\n本着科学性与必要性， 建议美方对酒精饮料标签的要求与国际标准协调一致，\n也可根据酒精饮料的不同产品形式区分要求： 酌情考虑不强制普通酒精饮料标签\n标注蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素； 若酒精饮料中额外添加了糖、果\n汁等配料， 或使用其他营养强化剂的， 可根据实际情况要求标示碳水化合物含量\n或其他营养素含量。以避免过度监管，降低企业合规成本与中小企业的负担。\n2、规章修订提案中要求在《美国联邦法规》第27 篇第 4、5、7 部分中分别\n增加新的子部分 L——酒精事实陈述条款。 现行法规已要求显示酒精含量、 胭脂\n红、 亚硫酸盐等信息， 该拟议规则要求增加单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯\n乙醇的液体盎司数等酒精事实声明， 且每份纯乙醇的液体盎司信息需精确到液体\n盎司的十分之一。 该条款与国际通行标准存在差异， 会给酒精饮料制造商和进口\n商， 特别是小企业带来额外的成本和负担。 建议美方维持现行法规， 不增加该条\n款， 不强制要求标示 “单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯乙醇的液盎司数”等\n信息，以避免对贸易造成不必要的障碍。\n4 of 4'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0065,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-02 14:31:40,,False,Comment 64: People's Republic of China,0900006486a1e605,2025-03-24 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,"The attached comments are submitted (in English and in Chinese) on behalf of Jiao Yang, Deputy Director General of China&#39;s WTO/TBT National Notification &amp; Enquiry Center.<br/>",m8j-866j-4ly2,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,People's Republic of China - WTO/TBT National Notification & Enquiry Center,,,2025-03-21 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:24,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

Importantly, this regulation is at the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) stage \nwhich invites public comments prior to finalization.1 As a student studying public health policy, I \nrealize that this phase is a vital opportunity for stakeholders, public, researchers and \nprofessionals to shape regulations that directly impact the health and lives of people.1 Public \ncommenting is not just a democratic mechanism but it is a critical tool that aligns regulatory \nactions with evidence and equity.\nHealth Risks of Alcohol Consumption:\nRoad traffic accidents are a pressing public health issue in the US with 32 people dying of \nautomobile crashes each year involving alcohol impaired driving accounting for 1 death in every \n45 minutes.2 According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), driving \nunder influence deaths were highest among young individuals aged 21 to 24 yrs (29%) and 25-34 \nyrs (28%).3 Excessive consumption of alcohol causes 178,000 deaths each year in the US, and \nleads to chronic heart and liver diseases, stroke, digestive issues, cancer and weakened immune \nsystem.4,5 It also has caused shorter life span leading individuals to die by an average of 24 \nyears.4 Effective regulations like TTB-2025-0002 can help reduce deaths by making people \nchoose to limit their alcohol consumption.4 \nEvidence-Based Impact of Labelling Alcoholic Beverages:\nAccording to Vasiljevic, M. et al. (2018), a randomized controlled trial found that when \nalcoholic beverages are labeled with clear information about Alcohol by Volume (ABV), and \namount of pure alcohol content per serving, individuals aged 18-40 years, social and non-\ndependent drinkers are significantly less likely to select high strength drinks.6 These finds show \nthat quantitative labels of alcoholic drinks reduces the appeal to strong alcoholic beverages \nespecially among individuals with low literacy levels about the risks of alcohol consumption, and \ngroups that are at an elevated risk of binge drinking and impaired driving.6 Another study done by Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), conducted a national survey with an aim to \nreceive consumer’s opinion about transparency in labeling alcoholic beverages with information \nsuch as calories, serving size, nutritional content, and alcohol content, that are a part of the \nregulation, TTB-2025-0002, along with other alcohol facts.7 The sample for the survey was \nnationally representative with US adults from all demographics.7 This study found that 63% to \n77% respondents supported policies that required the inclusion of nutrition and alcohol content \ninformation on the labels of alcoholic beverages, either somewhat or strongly.7 Whereas, 72% to \n90% respondents supported having more information on the labels as it would impact their \nchoice to purchase alcohol.7 A systematic review done in the UK also shows moderate evidence \nof labeling calories and ABV on purchasing choices of consumers showing increased preference \nfor alcoholic beverages with calorie count labels, and reduction in purchase of high calorie \nalcohol.8 While there is not much research done on evaluating the direct impact of labeling on \n“Driving While Intoxicated” (DWI) and alcohol related health issues among people in the US, \nthe above evidence-based research shows the psychological impact of labelling on consumers \npurchasing and alcoholic beverage choices based on content, that in turn suggests an increase in \nconsumer awareness about alcohol risks and a reduction in driving under influence and health \nissue prevalence due to alcohol consumption.6,7,8 While labeling alcoholic beverages alone \ncannot eliminate the issue of impaired driving, it can be a valuable evidence-informed strategy to \ncomplement other policy tools such as age limits, taxes and enforcement to help people make \ninformed health choices.9\nAddressing Health Equity:\nStandardized “Alcohol Facts” panel on labels of alcoholic beverages would be an equitable and \nlow cost strategy in bridging information gap.10 Rural and low-income communities often lack \naccess to resources and education.11 Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and \neducational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of \nalcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate lack of \naccess to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities causing them to face \nalcohol-related health issues.\nRecommendations:\nIntegrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities who don’t have literacy \nin English understand the information on the labels. Having alcohol facts panels on labels in \ndifferent commonly spoken languages in the US would help people understand it and make \ninformed health choices.\nConclusion:\nI commend the proposed regulation, TTB-2025-0002, as it supports evidence based strategies. \nThe nation has witnessed horrifying incidences such as the case of Jacqueline Saburido, who had \nto suffer from third degree burns due to her car being hit by a heavily intoxicated.13 The people \nof our country must never have to go through such experiences. TTB-2025-0002 can make this \nhappen. Therefore, I request the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to immediately \nfinalize and implement the regulation to protect the lives and health of all communities in the \nUnited States.1 TTB-2025-0002 ensures equity, helps alcohol risk communication and reduces \nalcohol-related harm.1References\n1.

Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \nRe: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages \n(Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) \n \nTo Whom it May Concern, \n \nThe American Society for Nutrition (ASN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on Alcohol \nFacts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. Founded in \n1928, ASN is the nation’s leading society for nutrition research and practice, representing more \nthan 8,000 professional members across 100 countries. Our members – including nutrition \nscientists, physicians, dietitians, and other stakeholders – are dedicated to advancing our mission \nof “A Healthier World Through Evidence-Based Nutrition.” ASN supports the Alcohol and \nTobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) efforts to implement labeling of alcohol content and \nnutritional information on alcoholic beverages, as this will impart important information to \nconsumers that they need to make informed health and nutrition-related purchases and decisions. \n \nThe “Alcohol Facts” panel in the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a \npercentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the \nnumber of calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.” \nThis information is important to promote transparency regarding the contents of alcoholic \nbeverages, and to highlight health and safety information for those who consume alcohol. \nAlcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after \ntobacco and obesity, increasing risk for at least seven types of cancer\n1. Alcoholic beverages can \nbe calorie-dense and therefore contribute to diet-related chronic diseases. On average, alcohol \naccounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.2 Many alcoholic beverages also contain \nadded sugars and other nutrients to limit. \n \nAs such, the proposed rule could be strengthened by also requiring additional nutritional content, \nincluding total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in \nmilligrams, and a percent Daily Value for each of these nutrients based on a 2,000-calorie diet. \n \n \n1 Alcohol and Cancer Risk 2025: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory. US Department of Health and Human \nServices, Office of the Surgeon General. January 3, 2025. \n2 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory \nCommittee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.   \n \nThe final rule should also require the number of standard drinks per container (instead of the \nproposed number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), and the conversion between \nstandard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. TTB may also consider dual-column \nlabeling for certain alcoholic beverages for those that are customarily consumed in one sitting. \nThis label has two columns, one for listing the nutritional facts related to a single serving and one \nlisting the nutritional facts for the contents of the entire package. \n \nASN supports the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on \nalcoholic beverage packages and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a \nwebpage), as this would specifically disadvantage populations that may be less likely to utilize \ntechnology to gain this important health and safety information.  \n \nASN urges TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts \nrule to ensure that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to \ndrink. To ensure timely consumer access to this important information, the final rule should \nadopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed. \n \nThank you in advance for your consideration of the American Society for Nutrition’s comments \non Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. \nPlease contact Sarah Ohlhorst, MS, RD, ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer \n(sohlhorst@nutrition.org; 240-428-3647) for more information. \n \nSincerely, \n \nJohn E.

Non-alcoholic beers are a growing product category(1) and market research suggests that consumers find the definition of these products confusing.(2) In 2023, the World Health Organization called for updated labeling mandates to ensure potential consumers are not misled by product descriptors and to protect groups seeking to abstain from alcohol.(3) If the TTB proposal is approved, non-alcoholic beers would be required to report alcohol content either in terms of percentage or through terminology: using the term non-alcoholic (for those with &lt;0.5% alcohol by volume) or the term, alcohol-free (for those with 0.0% alcohol by volume). If the term non-alcoholic is used, then alcohol percentage would also be required, but this is not the case for the term alcohol-free. To ensure consumers receive consistent, clear information that facilitates understanding of different terms, both alcohol by volume percentage and concordant terminology should be required. In fact, as a non-alcoholic beverage researcher, I recently evaluated non-alcoholic beer labels and found that all of the sample evaluated included both alcohol by volume percentage and relevant terminology on their labels, suggesting that a new requirement to include both would not involve an overhaul of current labeling practices.<br/><br/>With regard to nutritional content, the Food and Drug Administration requires that soft drinks (e.g., sodas, juices) include nutritional content on their labels and, if the TTB proposal is approved, full-strength alcohol would follow suit. A question from the TTB is whether non-alcoholic beers should be exempt from the nutritional content requirement. There is no reason for non-alcoholic beers to be exempt from this &ndash; caloric content influences beverage purchasing decisions(4) and consumers have a right to nutritional information to make informed decisions. To offer a clinical perspective, as a clinical psychologist, I have provided therapy for a client who had alcohol use disorder and who found value in using non-alcoholic beers to support abstinence from alcohol use, yet the client also had concern about carbohydrate intake due to co-occurring diabetes. Nutritional content on non-alcoholic beers would support awareness of carbohydrate content, with potential to shape health behavior. Further, in my assessment of  non-alcoholic beers, the majority assessed included calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content on their labels, indicating that most producers would be amenable to a new nutritional content requirement.<br/><br/>Also worth comment and absent from the TTB proposal is consumer communication about who should avoid non-alcoholic beers (and other non-alcoholic beverages that mirror alcohol). Certain kombucha companies voluntarily include on their label a warning against consumption for people avoiding alcohol (e.g., due to pregnancy, sensitivities), as the fermentation process can yield up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. A similar warning on non-alcoholic beers may be worthwhile. While non-alcoholic beers can be a helpful substitute for some,(5) their alcohol cues may activate craving for full-strength alcohol.(6) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included the mandated government health warning for alcohol. Arguably, a consumer communication that is tailored to the specific (non-alcoholic) product would be more relevant and informative than simply using the warning required for full-strength alcohol. Another consideration is whether minors should be permitted to consume non-alcoholic beers(7,8) &ndash; labels that clearly note to avoid consumption if avoiding alcohol may guide parent considerations about providing non-alcoholic beers to their children.(9) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included an age-restriction. As federal and state regulations evolve regarding at what age non-alcoholic beers can be purchased, relevant labeling will need to track.<br/><br/>At present non-alcoholic beer labeling is largely self-regulated. I appreciate the opportunity to offer comment, informed by both my research and clinical experiences, to support effective labeling strategies of non-alcoholic beers.<br/><br/>References<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>NielsenIQ.

Non-alcoholic beers are a growing product category(1) and market research suggests that consumers find the definition of these products confusing.(2) In 2023, the World Health Organization called for updated labeling mandates to ensure potential consumers are not misled by product descriptors and to protect groups seeking to abstain from alcohol.(3) If the TTB proposal is approved, non-alcoholic beers would be required to report alcohol content either in terms of percentage or through terminology: using the term non-alcoholic (for those with &lt;0.5% alcohol by volume) or the term, alcohol-free (for those with 0.0% alcohol by volume). If the term non-alcoholic is used, then alcohol percentage would also be required, but this is not the case for the term alcohol-free. To ensure consumers receive consistent, clear information that facilitates understanding of different terms, both alcohol by volume percentage and concordant terminology should be required. In fact, as a non-alcoholic beverage researcher, I recently evaluated non-alcoholic beer labels and found that all of the sample evaluated included both alcohol by volume percentage and relevant terminology on their labels, suggesting that a new requirement to include both would not involve an overhaul of current labeling practices.<br/><br/>With regard to nutritional content, the Food and Drug Administration requires that soft drinks (e.g., sodas, juices) include nutritional content on their labels and, if the TTB proposal is approved, full-strength alcohol would follow suit. A question from the TTB is whether non-alcoholic beers should be exempt from the nutritional content requirement. There is no reason for non-alcoholic beers to be exempt from this &ndash; caloric content influences beverage purchasing decisions(4) and consumers have a right to nutritional information to make informed decisions. To offer a clinical perspective, as a clinical psychologist, I have provided therapy for a client who had alcohol use disorder and who found value in using non-alcoholic beers to support abstinence from alcohol use, yet the client also had concern about carbohydrate intake due to co-occurring diabetes. Nutritional content on non-alcoholic beers would support awareness of carbohydrate content, with potential to shape health behavior. Further, in my assessment of  non-alcoholic beers, the majority assessed included calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content on their labels, indicating that most producers would be amenable to a new nutritional content requirement.<br/><br/>Also worth comment and absent from the TTB proposal is consumer communication about who should avoid non-alcoholic beers (and other non-alcoholic beverages that mirror alcohol). Certain kombucha companies voluntarily include on their label a warning against consumption for people avoiding alcohol (e.g., due to pregnancy, sensitivities), as the fermentation process can yield up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. A similar warning on non-alcoholic beers may be worthwhile. While non-alcoholic beers can be a helpful substitute for some,(5) their alcohol cues may activate craving for full-strength alcohol.(6) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included the mandated government health warning for alcohol. Arguably, a consumer communication that is tailored to the specific (non-alcoholic) product would be more relevant and informative than simply using the warning required for full-strength alcohol. Another consideration is whether minors should be permitted to consume non-alcoholic beers(7,8) &ndash; labels that clearly note to avoid consumption if avoiding alcohol may guide parent considerations about providing non-alcoholic beers to their children.(9) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included an age-restriction. As federal and state regulations evolve regarding at what age non-alcoholic beers can be purchased, relevant labeling will need to track.<br/><br/>At present non-alcoholic beer labeling is largely self-regulated. I appreciate the opportunity to offer comment, informed by both my research and clinical experiences, to support effective labeling strategies of non-alcoholic beers.<br/><br/>References<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>NielsenIQ.

(CIVYL), \nthe united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of \nwines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, Casa \nCuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and Pernod \nRicard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and implementation \nof public policies related to alcoholic beverages. \nFirstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and \ncontribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is \ndedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of \nalcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately \ninform consumers without causing confusion. \nIn this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code \nof Federal Regulations under Notice No. 237, which would mandate the inclusion of an ""Alcohol \nFacts"" panel on the labeling of alcoholic beverages. \nWe understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect consumers. However, we believe \nthat requiring the inclusion of nutritional information on labeling may not provide significant benefits to \nconsumers as the primary objective of alcoholic beverage labeling, from a public health perspective, is to \npromote responsible alcohol consumption and prevent harmful alcohol use. Including nutritional \ninformation on these beverages may create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" \npotentially leading to consumer confusion. \nAlcohol should not be considered a product that provides nutrients to the consumer. Including \nnutritional information on labels could mislead consumers into believing that alcoholic beverages are part \nof a balanced diet or provide essential nutrients. This could influence purchasing decisions in a way that \ndiverts attention from critical aspects such as alcohol content. Additionally, comparing the \nnutritional values of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages may be misleading, as their \ncharacteristics and intended purposes are fundamentally different. Factors such as caloric content, \ncarbohydrates, sugars, or fats in alcoholic beverages should not be equated with those of conventional \nfoods, given that alcohol itself is the primary differentiating component. In Mexico, legislation prohibits \nalcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits, as well as therapeutic, curative, or \nrehabilitative properties. \nIn Mexico, according to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising for these products must be \nlimited to informing them about their characteristics, quality, and production techniques, without \npresenting them as sources of well-being or health. Furthermore, Article 307 states that the advertising \nof food and non-alcoholic beverages should not be directly or indirectly associated with the consumption \nof alcoholic beverages nor induce harmful eating habits. Lastly, Article 6 of the General Health Law \nRegulations on Advertising establishes that product advertising must not attribute preventive, \ntherapeutic, rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or other qualities to them. This reinforces the \nprohibition of attributing nutritional value or properties that do not correspond to alcoholic beverages. \nRather than being useful, these statements could directly cause consumer confusion. \n \n \n \n  \nFurthermore, implementing this measure would represent an additional cost for manufacturers, \nimporters, and distributors of alcoholic beverages. This would contravene Article 2.2 of the WTO \nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which prohibits imposing technical regulations that \ncreate unnecessary obstacles to international trade without a justification based on legitimate \nobjectives of member states. We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect \nconsumers. However, we believe that the labeling requirement should be limited to declaring only the \nalcohol content. \nConsidering all the above, we respectfully request that the implementation of this modification \nregarding the inclusion of the “Alcohol Facts” panel be reconsidered, as it may not provide \nsignificant additional benefits to consumers and could, instead, lead to unintended confusion \nregarding the nature and nutritional value of alcoholic beverages and it must be limited to \ndeclaring only the alcohol content. Additionally, increasing regulatory and financial burdens on \nproducers, in particular small and medium-sized ones. \nHowever, if the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel is approved, it is recommended that the \ninformation should be allowed to be presented through electronic labeling (QR code, digital platform, or \nwebsite). This approach would facilitate access to information without imposing unnecessary regulatory \nor commercial burdens. \nThis tool offers the following advantages: \n• Unlimited information space for consumers. \n• Provides consumers with more information in a user-friendly and easily understandable \nformat.  \n• Easily accommodates changes in regulatory provisions. \n• Allows information to reach one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent \nexcessive and harmful alcohol use.  \n \nThe above is consistent with the "" Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food Information \nin Food Labelling”, which is being developed within the framework of the Codex Alimentarius Labeling \nCommittee. \nFinally, if this requirement is implemented, a gradual implementation period of five years would be the \nbest way to adopt such measures, allowing small producers to modify their supply chain for distribution \nin the U.S. \nFor these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less \nburdensome solutions. \nSincerely, \n \n \nPanambí Garcés \nGeneral Manager \n \n \n \n'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0073,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-02 17:54:51,,False,"Comment 71:  Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C.

I offer these comments as a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to specific requests for comment.\n\n\n\nTitle of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”\n\nWhich title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?\n\nAre consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?\n\nAlternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?\n\n\n\nIn many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts and dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to as “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is presented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the term “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol Facts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by seeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on a non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently providing alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. \n\n\n\nMandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information\n\nShould TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?\n\nFor greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?\n\nWould the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?\n\nShould TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?\n\nDo consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? \n\n\nSome aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include calories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily value for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars or other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to allow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for calories, fat, etc. \n\nI think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks cited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense balance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently giving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  \n\nFrom personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving of alcohol and what constitutes a serving. Having alcohol facts available is useful in making choices to maintain healthy weights and consume responsibly. \n\nCalculating Panel Elements & Tolerance Levels\n\nTTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still specific enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Specifically, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set.\n\nTTB should be mindful of tolerances that are so exact that it would cause undue financial burden to small operations to comply with little benefit to public health. I agree with the approach TTB is proposing.\n\nMandatory Listing of Alcohol Content by volume on Malt Beverages\n\nShould TTB require alcohol content statement on a beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act, but is subject to the IRC? \n\nShould TTB increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the statement amount for all malt beverage and beers? This would alleviate the need for expensive specialized equipment needed to test for alcohol content to a sufficient degree of certainty to meet the current tolerance standards. Would consumers receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance is increased? \n\nShould TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as the statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume?\n\nYes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements on beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act. Most consumers do not understand the regulatory distinction, so not seeing alcohol content on some products would be confusing and implementing the requirements “across the board” provides parity among producers. \n\nOn the matter of increasing labeling tolerances, as long as the tolerance is backed with evidence that shows that consumers would not suffer harm if the alcohol content was one percentage point higher than what is stated on a product, I support the proposal. A proposal that would require purchase of expensive equipment to test alcohol content for certainty if there is no public health reason makes no sense and only serves to reduce competition in the marketplace. \n\nI agree with TTB’s proposal to require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages and a statement that adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume. \n\nPlacement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of Alcohol Facts Statement\n\nWould it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?\n\nAlternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?\n\n\n\nAs a consumer, I do not feel strongly as to whether the alcohol content information is located on the Alcohol Facts statement or elsewhere on the label. However, I believe there should be a designated place where the information is required with options to provide it elsewhere (in addition) if a producer would like to include it as part of the label elsewhere. I think since the labels are changing so drastically, consumers should get used to finding important information in one spot on the container. By allowing the option to provide the information in more than one place, if producers have front of container labels that contain ABV, they would not need to redesign and reprint those labels in addition to having to comply with Alcohol Facts and/or allergen labeling requirements. \n\n\n\nMandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving\n\nTTB proposes to amend the regulations to require the listing of the number of U.S. fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, expressed to the nearest tenth of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume statement.\n\nWould including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?\n\nIs there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?\n\nTTB notes that the\xa0Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025,\xa0use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.\n\nShould the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the\xa0Dietary Guidelines'\xa0advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?\n\nTTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and regulatory burdens.\n\nThe public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. \n\n\n\nLinear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\nLinear Display\n\nThough this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be reasonable for certain containers. \n\nType Size\n\nUnless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. \n\nElectronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\nWhile it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important information to consumers. \n\nDual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display\n\nDoes dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?\n\nShould dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?\n\nThese are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have intended. \n\nOnce again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of alcohol beverages. \n\nKimberly Stryker""}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0123/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': ""Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt \nBeverages\nDocket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237] \nRIN 1513-AC93\nDear Reviewer,\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed mandatory alcohol facts \nstatement labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. I offer these comments \nas a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to \nspecific requests for comment.\nTitle of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”\n1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to \nconsumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information \nprovided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol \ncontent information?\n2. Are consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a \nServing Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause \nconfusion?\n3. Alternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to \nreadily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?\nIn many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts \nand dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to \nas “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is \npresented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the \nterm “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages \nfrom other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol \nFacts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by \nseeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on \na non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently \nproviding alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. \nMandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information\n1. Should TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent \nwith the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling \njurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and \nother foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient \nlabeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For \nexample, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed \nnutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? \nAlternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they \nmay rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient \nrequirements?2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts \nstatements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and \ncholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?\n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol \nbeverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?\n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of \nalcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could \nsuch a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol \nbeverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?\n5. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? \nHow might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate \ninformation about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol \nbeverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? \nSome aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include \ncalories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily \nvalue for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars \nor other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to \nallow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for \ncalories, fat, etc. \nI think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks \ncited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense \nbalance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently \ngiving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  \nFrom personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving \nof alcohol and what constitutes a serving.

Should TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, \nbut not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as \nthe statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than \n0.5% alcohol by volume?\nYes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements \non beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act.

The proposed \nlabel would require the disclosure of per-serving alcohol content, calorie count, and nutrient \ninformation. This action is long overdue and urgently needed, as it represents an important step \ntoward improving public health, enhancing consumer transparency, and encouraging more \ninformed and responsible alcoholic consumption. I respectfully urge the TTB to adopt this rule \nand to maintain the proposed five-year compliance period as it is both practical and reasonable \nfor industry application. \nThere are several compelling reasons as to why mandatory alcohol facts labeling should be \nimplemented. \n1. Enhancing Consumer Protection by Implementing Beverage Transparency  \nOne of the most important public health justifications for this rule is the urgent \nneed for transparency regarding the composition and nutrition of alcoholic beverages. \nUnlike packages foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \nalcoholic beverages regulated by the TTB are not currently required to include nutrition \nlabels. While the reasoning for this stems from decisions made in the 1930s, these \npolicies are outdated and no longer align with modern consumer expectations or health \npriorities.1  \nThe absence of transparency means that consumers continue to be unaware of \ningredients that could pose health risks, especially for those with allergies and dietary \nrestrictions. Many people are unaware that alcoholic beverages can contain sulfites, \nartificial colors, sweeteners, preservatives, or grains that may cause adverse reactions.2 A \nproduct that was once safe to consume may change formulations without the consumer’s \nknowledge. This lack of labeling creates unnecessary risk for individuals with food \nsensitivities or health conditions. While this proposed rule does not address allergen \ndisclosure, like that of Docket No. TTB-2025-0003,3 it lays the foundation for consumer \ntransparency among alcoholic beverages. Additionally, this rule supports health equity by \n \n1 admin-bluelabel, “Beer, Wine, Spirits Labels: Ingredients Labeling & Serving Facts,” Blue Label Packaging, \nFebruary 22, 2019, https://www.bluelabelpackaging.com/blog/why-dont-beer-wine-and-spirits-labels-have-to-\ndisclose-ingredients-or-serving-facts-on-labels/. \n2 “Alcohol Intolerance-Alcohol Intolerance - Symptoms & Causes,” Mayo Clinic, accessed April 21, 2025, \nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-intolerance/symptoms-causes/syc-20369211. \n3 “Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages,” Federal Register, January 17, \n2025, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00955/major-food-allergen-labeling-for-wines-\ndistilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages. making it easier for people with chronic conditions and dietary needs to make safe and \ninformed choices.  \n2. Promoting Nutritional Awareness \nAlcoholic beverages are a significant source of “hidden” calories. Without \nlabeling, many individuals unknowingly exceed their recommended daily intake for \ncalories or sugar through alcohol consumption alone. For example, a 1.5 ounce shot of \nhard liquor contains anywhere from 100 to 120 calories and that is before any mixers are \nadded.4  \nRequiring calorie and nutrient content labeling would encourage consumers to \nbetter track their intake and make more intentional decisions that correspond to their \nhealth goals. In a society that is increasingly focused on improving their health and \npreventing disease, transparency among consumed alcohol is essential. Emerging studies \nhave revealed an association between alcohol consumption and obesity.5 Thus, \ntransparency in labeling can contribute to nutritional awareness among consumers and \nsupport more conscious drinking habits. \n3. Reducing Risky Consumption and Binge Drinking Through Informed Choices \nTransparent alcohol labeling also plays a critical role in preventing \noverconsumption and binge drinking. According to the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), binge drinking is defined as consuming five or more \ndrinks for males or four or more for females within a two-hour period.6 However, without \nclear labeling of alcohol content and serving size, many individuals underestimate the \namount of alcohol within a beverage, particularly with ready to drink cocktails or \noversized containers. \nStudies have shown that alcohol labeling can influence drinking behavior and \nreduce the intentions to drink alcohol.7 More accurate labeling could encourage \nmoderation and promote responsible drinking habits, especially among casual drinkers or \nyounger consumers who may not be aware of the recommended limits. By implementing \na label, consumers would be able to gauge how much they are actually consuming, which \ncould potentially reduce binge drinking. \nThe proposed alcohol facts labeling rule is a critical step towards improving consumer \ntransparency, health equity, and public safety. This change would bring the labeling standard of \nalcoholic beverages to that of the same caliber of the labeling for food and non-alcoholic \nbeverages, thus allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding their health.

The objectives of \nBNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all \nCognac stakeholders overall. \n \nOn 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in \nthe Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring the disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, \nand nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to \nTTB’s regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.  \n \nOn TTB’s request for comments regarding the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” \n(both are currently being considered by the TTB): \nBNIC is favorable for the use of the title “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”. Indeed, the \ninformation included in the proposal refers to nutritional information in a serving of an alcoholic beverage \nwhich will be specific to the beverage in quest ion, rather than information on alcohol. Therefore, the title \n“Alcohol Facts” could be misleading or a cause of confusion for consumers.  \n \nOn TTB’s display proposals: \nLabeling space is limited and in efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of labeling (printing, use of ink etc.) \nit is desirable to limit the information which is printed out. Therefore,   \n- BNIC s trongly u rges the TTB to authorize the use of digital means to display the nutritional \nstatement. Authorizing the use of digital tools would present many advantages. Firstly, this would \nsave space on the label itself, reducing the use of paper, glue and ink to print the labels. Secondly, \nit would allow industry members to share further information with consumers about the product, \ni.e. the production process, list of ingredients, health and responsible consumption guidelines,  \nBUREAU NATIONAL INTERPROFESSIONNEL DU COGNAC \n23, Allées Bernard Guionnet • BP 90018 • 16101 Cognac Cedex France  \nT : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr \npackaging collection and sorting details and sustainability information. Digital tools such as QR \ncodes also allow for the information to be easily shared in different languages, allowing a greater \nnumber of consumers to understand and have readily access to information on the product. Finally, \ndigital tools also for easy updates, low compliance costs and avoid label waste which allows \nbusinesses to update their labels with minimal cost incurred. In the European Union, the wine \nindustry must only include the number of calories per 100ml on the bottle, with further information \nsuch as energy values and the list of ingredients being readily available via a QR Code in all 24 \nofficial languages of the European Union. This is very important for the alcoholic beverages sector \nwhich is made up of largely exported products.   \n- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly urges the TTB to remove the black box around the \ndeclaration which will unnecessarily use up space on the label. Removing the black box will allow \nindustry members more flexibility on the presentation of the required information.  \n- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly u rges the TTB to authorize a linear display on all \nbottles, regardless of their content. A linear display, rather than a columned table display, will allow \nindustry members to save space on their labels and offer them more flexibility in the declaration \npresentation.   \n \nOn TTB’s proposal regarding the information to be included in the declaration:  \n- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to allow sugar content statements to remain as an optional \nelement. This flexibility will allow industry members the possibility to align as much as possible \nwith international practices regarding this matter. For example, in E urope, many spirit industry \nmembers voluntarily disclose additional nutritional information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, \nprotein and salt.  \n- BNIC asks for the removal of the Alcohol by volume from the declaration. Firstly, the alcohol by \nvolume percentage is already presented on the front label, in the same field of vision as the \nCommercial name and the Legal name of the product. Repeating the alcohol by volume percentage \nwill not share any further information with the consumer as this information is already easily \navailable on the front label. However, it would take up more room unnecessarily for industry \nmembers.  \n- BNIC would like to inform TTB that the expression of alcohol in fluid ounces may lead to \nconfusion among consumers. Fluid ounces are not commonly used in other countries, particularly \nforeign speaking countries. We therefore recommend the option of using international standards \nsuch as ml or cl. \n- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to not align the declaration on distilled spirits with the FDA \nNutrition Facts label. The inclusion of such information is unnecessary due to the differences \nbetween alcohol beverages and other foods, Cognac for example does not contain sodium.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposal regarding serving sizes:  \nBUREAU NATIONAL INTERPROFESSIONNEL DU COGNAC \n23, Allées Bernard Guionnet • BP 90018 • 16101 Cognac Cedex France  \nT : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr \n- BNIC recommends avoiding the use of nutritional information for the whole bottle as this could \nlead to consumer confusion who may believe the information relates to a serving size rather than \nthe whole bottle.  \n- BNIC would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes. Serving sizes may \nvary between different countries and may also differ depending on the specificity of the product. \nFor example, a typical serving size in France for a distilled spirit would be 30ml.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposal to permit a 20% tolerance above or below the labeled amount for calories, \ncarbohydrates, protein and fat: \nBNIC kindly welcomes and supports this proposal. Indeed, BNIC and Cognac industry members have \ncalculated average nutritional values for Cognac with an ABV of 40%. TTB’s current proposal would allow \nfor this average nutritional value to be used by our industry members and facilitate small and medium-sized \nbusinesses in implementing the new rule.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposed exclusion of requesting a new COLA request: \nBNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This \nwill largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized \nbusinesses.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposed transition period:  \n- BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic \nclimate for our industry, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for industry members.  \n- BNIC would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was \nput on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. As a premium product, Cognac stock \nturnover can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits, especially during the \ncurrent particularly difficult economic conjuncture of industry.  \n- BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238 : Major Food \nAllergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  is adopted, that its entry into \nforce is aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.  \n '}]",TTB-2025-0002-0099,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-16 13:30:34,,False,"Comment 96:  Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC),",0900006486a9540e,2025-04-16 04:00:00,2025-08-15 13:38:28,See attached file(s),m9j-px6y-11r8,,Comment(s),0,,,Cognac,,,France,,,,,,,,2025-04-16 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:03:58,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,False,False,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,"In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an ``Alcohol Facts'' statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

1,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0003/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': ' 1 \nComments on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237, RIN 1513-AC93  I appreciate the opportunity to offer my individual comments on the proposed rule regarding Alcohol Facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The intent and purpose of this rule are commendable, as it aims to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the alcohol content and nutritional value of these beverages. Such transparency is crucial for informed consumer choices and aligns with public health objectives. The general outline of the proposed rule is a significant step forward in enhancing label clarity and consumer awareness. However, I would like to offer a few specific comments and suggestions to further improve its implementation, effectiveness and fairness. Linear Display I believe that a linear display of the required information should not only be allowable but actually preferable. It is more cost-effective, efficient, informs consumers sufficiently, and requires less label real estate. Additionally, a linear display is less disruptive to the label\'s overall design, and avoids impairing the seller’s branding and presentation. Compliance Timeline I propose extending the compliance timeline to six years. Considering the industry standard of a five-year label turnover, a six-year period would better align with this cycle, significantly reducing the regulatory burden. This extension would enable producers to comply without incurring unnecessary costs or causing undue harm to the marketplace and consumers. Given the lengthy development of this rule, an abrupt compliance period shorter than the industry\'s label turnover timeframe would be impractical and ill-advised.    2 \nCategorization of Hard Ciders The rule would benefit from including a separate categorization of hard ciders due to their unique characteristics, rather than jamming them into a non-germane category. Hard ciders differ from other alcoholic beverages in alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. Alcohol Content: Hard ciders vary significantly in alcohol content, from low-alcohol variants to levels comparable to wine or beer. Clear guidelines based on alcohol content would help consumers make informed choices and enable producers to comply with specific requirements. Packaging Sizes: Hard ciders come in various packaging sizes, requiring different labeling considerations. A separate categorization would allow for tailored labeling requirements to accommodate diverse packaging options. Fermentation Variability: The fermentation process for hard ciders differs from that of other alcoholic beverages. Factors like apple type, fermentation duration, and additional ingredients impact the final product. Regulations that account for these variabilities would ensure consumers receive accurate product information. Nutritional Profiles: Hard ciders have distinct nutritional profiles, with varying levels of sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients. A separate categorization would allow for more accurate labeling, ensuring consumers understand the nutritional content. Therefore, I recommend that TTB establish a distinct category for hard ciders within the regulatory framework. One way to do this is by creating specific guidelines that address the unique aspects of hard ciders, including their alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. This approach would improve clarity and compliance, benefiting both consumers and producers. Lessened Requirements for 50 ml Minibottles I recommend lessened requirements for 50 ml minibottles of hard liquor/spirits due to the significant challenges posed by limited labeling space. Prioritizing essential information ensures readability and design integrity. Since minibottles are often sold in sets with comprehensive outer packaging, extensive individual labeling is unnecessary. Their small portion size presents a lower risk, justifying less stringent requirements. Lessened compliance for minibottles benefits consumers by keeping  3 \nlabels uncluttered and clear, streamlining regulatory processes, and reducing the burden on producers, especially small businesses.  I recommend implementing guidelines for minibottles that specify minimum required information, such as alcohol content and a general warning, to maintain essential disclosures while allowing flexibility. Other Issues § 7.63 Mandatory Label Information ""Mandatory label information"" should be capitalized for consistency with other section titles: ""Mandatory Label Information."" Examples in Figures In the linear display example for distilled spirits (§ 5.212): ""Serving Size 1.7 fl oz (50 mL)"" should read ""Serving Size 1.5 fl oz (44 mL)"" to maintain consistency with other serving sizes. Rounding Rules The rules for rounding percentages and numerical values (such as alcohol content and nutritional information) should be explicitly stated to ensure consistency. For instance, specifying how to handle rounding for values like 14.95% alcohol by volume would provide clarity and avoid discrepancies. I suggest stating: ""All percentages and numerical values should be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percent (0.1%) for clarity and consistency."" Optional Information The conditions for including optional information, such as additional statements of alcohol content or total sugars, should be clearly defined. This clarity would help prevent inconsistent labeling practices and ensure uniform presentation of all necessary information.    4 \nLabeling for Small Containers The labeling requirements for very small containers, where space is limited, need clarification. Specifying minimum font sizes and prioritizing information can help producers comply without compromising readability.  I suggest: “For containers smaller than 50 ml, the minimum font size for mandatory information should be 1.0 mm. Priority should be given to listing alcohol content, serving size, and allergens.” Definitions of Terms Terms like ""non-alcoholic,"" ""alcohol free,"" and ""low alcohol"" might be interpreted differently by consumers. Providing clear definitions and consistent usage in the regulations would help prevent ambiguity and ensure consumer understanding. One way to do this would be: ""Non-alcoholic: Contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Alcohol free: Contains 0.0% alcohol by volume. Low alcohol: Contains less than 1.2% alcohol by volume."" Scope of Mandatory Information Clarify what is considered mandatory versus optional information within the Alcohol Facts statement to avoid confusion. Clear distinctions between mandatory and optional information will help ensure consistent labeling practices across the industry. I suggest: ""Mandatory information includes alcohol content, serving size, and nutrient information. Optional information may include additional health claims or ingredient details, provided they are accurately labeled as optional."" Product Variability The rule should address products with variable compositions, such as cocktails with different fruit content that may absorb spirits. Providing guidance on labeling these products will help ensure consumers receive accurate information about their beverages.   5 \nA suggested guideline could be: “Products with variable compositions should list average alcohol content and nutrient information based on standard recipes. Any significant variations should be noted in the labeling to inform consumers.” Compliance Date and Small Businesses TTB asked:  Does the proposed compliance date suffice to limit the negative impact on small businesses and reduce overall costs of compliance while ensuring that consumers receive adequate information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the alcohol beverage products they are purchasing and consuming? In my view, the costs of label compliance are substantial, especially for smaller producers. Much of this cost could be avoided by setting the compliance timeframe slightly longer than the average industry label turnover, which is approximately five years. Therefore, I recommend a six-year compliance timeframe. This period would apply to both small and large producers, allowing them to comply earlier on a voluntary basis, while the mandatory requirement would only take effect after six years. This approach would be economically efficient and impose less regulatory burden. Benefits of Alcohol Content Statements TTB asked:  What are the potential benefits to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? I believe that alcohol content expressed as a percentage by volume has been familiar and useful for consumers for years. It provides a clear and straightforward measure that helps consumers make informed decisions. This approach avoids many of the complications associated with alcohol quantity, serving sizes, and package sizes. Therefore, I support requiring alcohol content percentage on all beverages. Alcohol Content Tolerances TTB asked:  Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers? If so, does the same argument apply to wines, which currently have a 1.5 percentage point tolerance for wines up to 14 percent alcohol by volume, and a 1 percentage point tolerance for wines with an alcohol content of over 14 percent alcohol by volume?  6 \nIn my experience, consumers do not focus on decimal points and fractions. A reasonable tolerance level is acceptable for consumers, as they do not require precise laboratory measurements. Aligning the tolerance for malt beverages with that for wines should be adequate. Broader tolerances accommodate natural product variations and reduce the need for frequent batch testing for alcohol content. Labeling for Non-Alcoholic Malt Beverages TTB asked:  Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume? Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements? It seems evident that non-alcoholic malt beverages absolutely must have a label disclosing that they contain small (or trace) amounts of alcohol. This is important for individuals who avoid alcohol for religious, dietary, medical, or legal reasons. If these beverages are already subject to labeling requirements from other agencies, TTB need not impose further labeling. However, if there is an oversight gap, TTB should ensure proper labeling. Alcohol Content Range for Table Wines TTB asked:  Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers? It seems to me that to reduce the disproportionate burden on small wineries and importers, they should be allowed to indicate alcohol content as a range for table wines. This approach would provide sufficient information to consumers while relieving some of the regulatory burden. Allowing a range would be consistent with the reasons discussed in the NPRM and would not unfairly penalize consumers by depriving them of important information. Dietary Guidelines on Moderate Drinking TTB asked:  Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?  7 \nMy thoughts are that including dietary advice on moderate drinking has no place on these labels. The purpose of the labels is to disclose the contents of the beverage container to consumers, not to provide general education on drinking habits. Such information does not add to the purchasing decision process and is outside the scope of the rule. While it may be useful in some contexts, it is not appropriate for product labeling.  Thank you for considering my comments. I hope they provide valuable insights and contribute to the successful finalization of the Alcohol Facts labeling regulations.
