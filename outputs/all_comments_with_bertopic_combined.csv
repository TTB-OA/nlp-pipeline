ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATIONS 
 
G/TBT/N/USA/2182 AND G/TBT/N/USA/2183 
 
(ALCOHOL FACTS STATEMENTS IN THE LABELING OF WINES, DISTILLED SPIRITS, AND MALT 
BEVERAGES) AND (MAJOR FOOD ALLERGEN LABELING FOR WINES, DISTILLED SPIRITS, 
AND MALT BEVERAGES) 
 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States for 
providing the oppor tunity to comment on the draft s “Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spiri ts, and Malt Beverages ” and “Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages”, notified on 22 January 
2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182 and G/TBT/N/USA/2183. The EU apologies for sending 
these comments after the deadline of 15th of August. 
 
The EU would like to note that Codex Alimentarius Guidelines on nutrition labelling 
CXG 2-1985 states with respect to the presentation of nutrient content under Section 
3.4.3 the following: ‘’Information on the amounts of protein, carbohydrate and fat in 
the food should be expressed in g per 100 g or per 100 ml or per package if the 
package contains only a single portion. In addition, this information may be given 
per serving as quantified on the label or per portion provided that the number of 
portions contained in the package is stated.’’  
The EU would like therefore to invite the US authorities to allow the expression of the 
content of  the nutrition declaration to be provided per 100 ml along with the 
information provided per serving size, to align with the provisions of the international 
guidelines above and allow for a more immediate comparison among different  
alcoholic beverages.  If the alignment with the guidelines is not possible, the EU 
would like to invite the US authorities to provide justifications for this deviation. 
 
Finally, the EU would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 
238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is 
adopted, its entry into force be aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.  
 
 
The EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comment s could be taken into 
account and replied to before adoption of the notified drafts.

It should never be provided solely via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology (e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land).  <br/><br/>Because consumers need this information as soon as possible, the final rule should shorten the proposed compliance period from 5 years to 3.5 years to prevent further delay of consumer access to this basic safety information. <br/><br/>Please prioritize transparency and health of those with food allergies by requiring comprehensive labeling of both allergens and ingredients on the physical packaging of alcoholic beverages. This will ensure that Americans who drink have access to all the information they need to make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kristy Mitchell",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,gratitude,0.9860157370567322,"{'admiration': 0.0004327080969233066, 'amusement': 6.0976595705142245e-05, 'anger': 0.00016974408936221153, 'annoyance': 0.0016750498907640576, 'approval': 0.028716595843434334, 'caring': 0.002126215258613229, 'confusion': 0.0005776753532700241, 'curiosity': 0.0002448355662636459, 'desire': 0.0008337426697835326, 'disappointment': 0.0008253998239524662, 'disapproval': 0.0035728977527469397, 'disgust': 0.00020341567869763821, 'embarrassment': 5.5875498219393194e-05, 'excitement': 0.00012364904978312552, 'fear': 0.0001631731283850968, 'gratitude': 0.9860157370567322, 'grief': 4.910328789264895e-05, 'joy': 0.00014117907267063856, 'love': 0.00016033879364840686, 'nervousness': 0.000122151366667822, 'optimism': 0.0019413651898503304, 'pride': 5.851168680237606e-05, 'realization': 0.004426764324307442, 'relief': 0.0002142502780770883, 'remorse': 0.00010062399815069512, 'sadness': 0.0003055641136597842, 'surprise': 4.160559183219448e-05, 'neutral': 0.9528075456619263}"

Japan’s Comment on the “G/TBT/N/USA/2183” 
 
Japan appreciates that the United States of America provided WTO members the 
opportunity to comment on 27 CFR Part 4, 5, and 7  by notifying the 
“G/TBT/N/USA/2183”.  
 
The proposed mandatory labelling of major food allergen could impose significant 
burden on small businesses such as liquor manufacturers and importers. In order to 
reduce the burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to 
prevent any problems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following 
requests: 
 
[Comment] 
Japan requests that the proposal to exempt distilled spirits from mandatory allergen

This is a critical step toward protecting consumer health. However, I believe this proposal should go further — we NEED full ingredient transparency, not just a limited list of major allergens. Millions of Americans today are avoiding specific ingredients beyond the eight major allergens — including things like seed oils, artificial flavorings, stabilizers, sulfites, and sweeteners — due to allergies, autoimmune reactions, or other serious health conditions. These ingredients, though not legally classified as allergens, can cause inflammation, migraines, skin conditions, and long-term metabolic or neurological issues for sensitive individuals. Some may not even realize that alcohol contains additives that would otherwise be disclosed on any other food product. It's also important to recognize that many Americans are waking up to the hidden toxins in our food and drink supply. The recent wave of change from the FDA — such as re-evaluating food dyes, banning harmful ingredients, and the growing momentum around ingredient transparency — reflects the fact that people want to make informed choices. Alcohol should not be exempt from this movement, especially when it's such a widely consumed product in the U.S. We label ingredients in soda, juice, and energy drinks — it makes no sense that wine, beer, and spirits remain behind a curtain of secrecy.

I respectfully urge TTB to: • Finalize the proposed allergen labeling rule without delay. • Reintroduce and adopt a mandatory full ingredient labeling rule as originally considered in the 2022 settlement with consumer advocacy groups. • Recognize the overwhelming public support for ingredient transparency, especially among the growing number of health-conscious Americans.

Comment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) 
VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION 
Dear Administrator Ryan:  
Consumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important 
rulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and 
MajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to 
strengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in 
grams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the 
format and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how 
this rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and 
to urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the 
basic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other 
beverages and food. 
Leading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol 
labeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates 
alcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers 
what’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with 
cheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, 
Calley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full 
transparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 
CFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol 
labeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the 
available evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have 
documented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that

4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but 
significant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  
Similarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard 
drinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate 
their alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that 
do not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more 
conscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of 
alcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related 
harms.7  
These spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to 
consumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for 
Surgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third 
biggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can 
increase the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public 
awareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate 
drinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating 
the health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage 
Labeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that 
worthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its 
pledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  
There is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see 
on the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism 
can end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0001) 
Submitted by: Recover Alaska 
Date: August 7, 2025 
To Whom It May Concern, 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking to require allergen 
labeling for alcoholic beverages. Recover Alaska strongly supports this proposed rule as a 
meaningful step forward in protecting public health and advancing transparency for all 
consumers. 
Recover Alaska is a statewide coalition dedicated to reducing excessive alcohol use and its 
harms across Alaska. In our work, we often hear from Alaskans who are trying to make 
safer and healthier choices for themselves and their families—including individuals with 
food allergies and parents of children with severe reactions. Yet today, they are left 
guessing whether an alcoholic beverage contains a potentially dangerous allergen. 
This is unacceptable. Alcoholic beverages are one of the only consumables not currently 
required to disclose major allergens. And yet many contain common allergens such as 
wheat, milk, eggs, or tree nuts—sometimes used directly, and other times as hidden 
processing aids. 
We applaud TTB for advancing this proposal and recommend the following improvements 
to ensure it truly protects consumers: 
1. Require On-Package Disclosure 
Allergen information must appear clearly and directly on the package, not via QR 
codes or online-only disclosures. Alaska has large swaths of rural and Tribal land 
where digital access is limited or unavailable—this rule must ensure equity by 
making vital safety information universally accessible. 
2. Do Not Exempt Processing Aids 
Allergic reactions can occur even if the allergenic ingredient was used as a 
processing aid. We support TTB’s approach to include allergens regardless of how 
they are used in production. 
3. Strengthen Disclosure Formatting and Speciﬁcity 
TTB should require allergen labeling to follow consistent formatting and placement  
rules, and to include species-speciﬁc language for ﬁnﬁsh. For example, “Contains: 
salmon” is far more helpful than “Contains: ﬁsh. ” 
4. Shorten the Compliance Timeline to 3.5 Years 
As with the Alcohol Facts rule, consumers have already waited too long for basic 
safety information. We urge TTB to shorten the proposed 5-year compliance period 
to 3.5 years. 
Alaskans with food allergies—particularly in remote areas with limited healthcare access—
deserve the same protections as everyone else. This rule is a long-overdue and essential 
move toward that goal. Thank you for your leadership in protecting consumers and 
ensuring that alcohol labeling ﬁnally meets the same public health standards applied to 
other foods and beverages.

TTB Proposal on Allergen Declaration in Alcoholic Beverage Labeling 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published the 
proposal (Notice No. 238) ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food allergens in 
alcoholic beverages. 
Comparison of the TTB proposal vs. the Official Mexican Standard NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, 
Alcoholic Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and Commercial Labeling: 
Pursuant to  Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages. 
Pursuant to NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, Alcoholic 
Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and 
Commercial Labeling. 
Proposal to add the following legend to 
alcoholic beverage labeling: 
“Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"" 
followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is 
derived, for example, 
9. Labeling 
 
The labeling of the products covered by this 
Standard, in addition to complying with the 
provisions of the Regulations and other applicable 
legal provisions, shall be subject to the following: 
(…) 
“Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"" 
This wording differs from the current voluntary 
allergen declaration (interim rule,  T.D. TTB -53 
(71 FR 42260) which states that in alcoholic 
beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, 
primary allergens may be voluntarily declared 
on labels affix ed to the container. The 
declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of 
the food source of each allergen (e.g., 
""Contains: egg""). 
9.3 Mandatory Requirements. The following are 
mandatory sanitary and commercial information 
requirements: 
(…) 
9.3.7 Sanitary Information. 
 
9.3.7.7 List of ingredients. 
9.3.7.1.1 The list of ingredients must appear on the 
label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or 
creams and all these alcoholic beverages, which 
after distillation and/or before bottling use 
optional ingredient s and/or additives that cause 
hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy and are 
present in the final product. 
Definition of Major Food Allergen: 
 
""The proposed regulations define the term 
""major food allergen"" as any of the following: 
 
 Milk 
 Egg 
 Fish (e.g.,  bass, flounder, or cod) 
Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, 
or shrimp) 
 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or 
walnuts) 
 Wheat 
 Peanuts 
 Soybeans 
 Sesame 
 
The defined term also includes any food 
ingredient that contains protein derived from 
one of these nine foods or food groups, subject 
to certain exceptions. 
The following foods and ingredients have been 
shown to cause hypersensitivity and must always 
be declared: 
 
9.3.7.1.1.1 Cereals containing gluten, e.g.: wheat, 
rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybr idized strains, 
and products thereof; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.2 Egg and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.3 Peanut and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.4 Soy and its products, with the 
exception of soybean oil; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.5 Milk and dairy products, including 
lactose; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.6 Tree nuts and their derivatives, and 
 
9.3.7.1.1.7 Sulfite in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or 
more. 
Compliance Period: The TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date a final rule 
resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that food allergens must be declared in the 
ingredient list only if they are present in the final product, without the need for a specific warning, 
and only in liqueurs or creams, cocktails, and prepared beverages. 
On the other hand, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the example 
""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". Furthermore, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim rule, T.D. TTB-53 
(71 FR 42260)) establishes that in alcoholic beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, p rimary 
allergens may be voluntarily declared on labels.  The declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the food source of each allergen (e.g., ""Contains: 
egg""). However, the TTB proposal seeks to make allergen declaration mandatory. It should be noted 
that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in distilled alcoholic beverages, 
provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes a distillation process that completely 
removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled product or ingredient. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including 
the following: 
 “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived; or 
 A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that adding 
an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real benefit to the 
consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which would go against 
Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks 
to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers. The CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the 
General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), recommends that allergen 
declaration be preferably done within the ingredient list.  In cases where a separate declaration is 
required, it should be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the 
allergen and, when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.  The 
interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily 
declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include the word ""Contains"", 
followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as ""Contains: egg"". It is proposed 
that the TTB consider the possibility of declaring major allergens as part of the ingredient list, which 
is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients that 
cause hypersensitivity and are present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for 
the consumer to understand and would be in line with the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developme nt (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and that 
excessive information can confuse the consumer. If it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic beverage labeling, it 
is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to provide additional information.  
This can be achieved through electronic labeling, using a QR code, a digital medium, or a website. 
This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited space for consumer information, presenting it 
in a friendly and easy-to-understand format. In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in 
regulatory provisions, and facilitates information reaching young people, a vulnerable g roup, to 
prevent harmful alcohol consumption.  It also allows for the development of educational and 
interactive content for the consumer.  Thus, consumers would be effectively informed without 
overloading alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement 
on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To clearly 
and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed that it be sufficient to include them in 
the product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name.  It is 
also proposed to consider the use of e lectronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to 
display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of  ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of 
the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient list, 
including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section.  It is also suggested to 
evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display detailed 
allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C 
Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) be required to be listed in one 
statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement 
that includes the major food allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the 
major food allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another statement be 
used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, as they 
can easily identify them on the label.  Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic labeling (QR 
codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding  overloading the 
physical product label. 
 5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including the 
proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this information? 
Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on industry members 
as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately? 
Requiring specific wording and location for allergen information on the label can create trade 
barriers and increase costs, negatively affecting the trade of alcoholic beverages.  Therefore, it is 
proposed that this information can be placed anywhere on the label.  According to studies by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), presenting too much information 
together can make it difficult for consumers to identify important data. To avoid this, it is suggested 
to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display 
additional allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements for major 
allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already applicable to all mandatory 
information on alcohol beverage l abels? For example, should the required allergen disclosure 
statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent practicable, should TTB mandate formatting 
consistent with FDA requirements for major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for allergen 
declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional costs for 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs could be considered 
a tec hnical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade 
barriers. This agreement establishes that technical regulations should  not be implemented that 
hinder international trade without valid justification in the legitimate objectives of member states. 
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985): 
Provisions for Allergen Labeli ng of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established that the 
presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. Should a separate 
declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains ________"" (or an equivalent term) 
and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient list, when present.  This provision avoids 
the use of a more extensive legend, which could confuse the consumer. 
Conclusion: 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic beverages 
be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs and barriers to 
international trade.  Likewise, it is proposed that the declaration of major allergens in alcoholic 
beverages be limited to thei r inclusion in the ingredient list.  Should an additional declaration be 
required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the CODEX Alimentarius and the 
Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)), using only the legend 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a more extensive text. It is essential that 
the possibility of using electronic labeling (through QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to 
provide additional information or legends about ma jor allergens be considered.  This method 
facilitates access to relevant information for the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary 
regulatory and commercial burdens.

Executive Summary 
 
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) received an unpaid Application from the 
Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand (BWSCNZ) in 2003 seeking to amend the 
Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements and 
Declarations, of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code). BWSCNZ 
ceased operations in December 2006, and the Application was taken over by the Brewers 
Association of New Zealand (BANZ). In referring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment 
Report refers to BWSCNZ for activities prior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  
 
The Applicant sought an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass (a processing 
aid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain tropical and subtropical fish) on 
the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. The 
exemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a fining 
agent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse reactions 
in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant provided evidence that dietary 
exposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption was extremely low. Results of oral 
challenge studies were also provided indicating that isinglass did not cause an allergic 
reaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher than the 
potential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer and wine. 
A new Good Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in 
isinglass has also been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. 
 
At Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public 
health and safety implications of this Application. At Draft Assessment, two options were 
proposed; (1) reject the Application thus maintaining the status quo; or (2) prepare a draft 
variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the requirement to 
declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a 
clarifying agent.  
 
Risk Assessment 
 
At Final Assessment, the key risk assessment findings include: 
 
• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically 
relevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  
 
• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  
   
• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration 
or centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, 
do not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  
  
• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not 
detectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed 
in the filtration process; and 
  iii
• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very 
low and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers.  
 
Therefore, taking into account all of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers.  
 
The key risk assessment issues, including issues raised by submitters, are discussed in 
Section 8 of this Report. Additional information is provided at Attachment 3 – Risk 
Assessment Report and Attachment 4 – Food Technology Report. 
 
Risk Management 
 
At Draft Assessment, submitters raised concerns regarding the maintenance of the quality of 
isinglass and its usage. FSANZ considers current production methods and market factors 
adequately address the quality of isinglass; and the usage and amount of isinglass in food 
products is managed through existing provisions in the Code for the use of processing aids. 
Information from the wine and beer industries also emphasises that isinglass is sparingly used 
as it is one of the most expensive fining agents available.  
 
Some submitters raised further concerns regarding the impact of an exemption on the 
provision of information for informed choices. FSANZ notes, however, the particular issues 
raised were not in respect of allergenicity or related matters and, therefore, fall beyond the 
scope of this Application.  
 
Due to the above factors, FSANZ does not consider further regulatory measures are required. 
Further detail is provided at Section 9 of this report. 
 
Decision 
 
FSANZ approves a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant an 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
 
Reasons for Decision 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and 
wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: 
 
• does not raise any health and safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers;  
 
• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the 
information related to the allergenicity of the product. 
 
• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products; 
 
  iv
• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen 
declaration; and 
 
• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, 
provides a net benefit to affected parties. 
 
The approved draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. 
 
Consultation 
 
In response to the release of the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ received twenty-seven 
submissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from industry, two from 
government and one from a public health organisation. A summary of submissions on the 
Draft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. 
 
Overall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to 
providing an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption. Of the 
remaining two submitters, one provided support, in-principle, indicating concern that the 
evidence did not show that there is no risk. The other indicated support based on a condition 
that FSANZ consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced 
levels of parvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration.  
 
A significant proportion of submitters who objected to the proposed exemption linked their 
arguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information 
relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. 
The requirement to declare isinglass was seen to enable consumers to make informed choices 
about foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons with a particular 
focus on vegetarianism/veganism.  
 
There were two submitters who objected to an exemption as they believed they had 
experienced an allergic fish-related reaction from consuming wine. Further information was 
sourced from these submitters in relation to their allergic condition and the products that may 
have caused allergic reactions.   
 
After considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ clarified some of 
the issues raised by submitters through targeted consultations.  
  
Implementation and Review 
 
The FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food 
Regulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). 
 
Subject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to 
grant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In 2003, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) received an unpaid Application 
from the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand (BWSCNZ) seeking to amend the 
Code to provide an exemption from the allergen labelling requirements for isinglass when 
used in the production of beer and wine. BWSCNZ ceased operations in December 2006, and 
the Application was taken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand (BANZ). In 
referring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment Report refers to BWSCNZ for activities 
prior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  
 
This Final Assessment Report discusses matters in relation to providing an exemption from 
the allergen labelling requirements for isinglass and addresses issues raised in submissions to 
the Draft Assessment Report. The draft variation to the Code is provided at Attachment 1. 
 
1. Nature of the Application 
 
1.1 Background to the Application 
 
On 12 August 2002, the BWSCNZ, on behalf of the Brewing Industry of New Zealand, wrote 
to FSANZ requesting that an exemption be granted for isinglass from the mandatory 
declaration requirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory 
Statements and Declarations. In the accompanying documentation that was provided to 
FSANZ, the BWSCNZ requested a permanent exemption, or if this was not possible, a 
temporary exemption, to allow further scientific evidence to be obtained regarding the non-
allergenicity of isinglass.   
 
On 20 September 2002, FSANZ responded to this request, advising that, in the absence of 
substantial scientific evidence on the relationship between residual levels of isinglass in beer 
and associated allergenicity, it was not in a position to consider exemptions to the 
requirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. However, FSANZ advised that it would consider 
an application to amend the Standard should further research provide persuasive new 
evidence in this area. 
 
On 6 January 2003, the BWSCNZ resubmitted the document dated 12 August 2002 and 
requested that it be considered as an application. It was formally accepted and placed on the 
FSANZ Work Plan on 7 February 2003.  
 
On 15 October 2003, the Applicant requested that wine also be considered within the scope 
of their Application. Additionally, the Applicant requested a four-year exemption from the 
requirement to label for isinglass, in line with the European Commission’s proposed 
amendment to Directive 2000/13/EC. Under this amendment, the European Commission 
proposed to consider temporary exemptions from allergen labelling until November 2007, for 
derivatives of allergens that are unlikely to cause allergic reactions, while awaiting further 
scientific evidence for a permanent exemption.   
 
On 19 December 2003, FSANZ agreed to expand the scope of the Application to include 
wine. However, FSANZ did not agree to the request for a temporary exemption and sought 
further information from the Applicant under subsection 34(1) of the Food Standards 
Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (FSANZ Act) (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). A 
response to this request was received on 28 June 2004.   
 4
However, further information provided by the Applicant was considered to be insufficient 
and a subsequent request for information under subsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was 
in force prior to 1 July 2007) was sent in December 2004.  
 
Meanwhile in October 2004, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that 
was submitted to the European Commission by the Brewers of Europe, and the Brewing, 
Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BE/BFBi) under the requirements of 
Commission Directive 2003/89/EC. This dossier titled ‘Notification for the temporary 
exemption from labelling for isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing’ (the BE/BFBi 
notification), was used by FSANZ in the assessment of this Application.   
 
On 16 May 2005, FSANZ received further information from the Applicant and proceeded to 
the Initial Assessment of Application A490. The Initial Assessment Report for Application 
A490 was advertised for public comment from 5 October to 16 November 2005. Following 
an assessment of submitters’ comments, together with the information provided by the 
Applicant, FSANZ concluded that sufficient information was not available to progress the 
Application to the Draft Assessment stage. 
 
In March 2006, FSANZ requested the Applicant to provide further information under 
subsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). In February 2008, 
FSANZ received further information from the Applicant, and proceeded to the Draft 
Assessment.  
 
The Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director, 
Allergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Loblay endorsed the FSANZ 
preferred regulatory approach. The Draft Assessment Report was advertised for public 
comment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. Following an assessment of the comments 
received from submitters and the completion of targeted consultations with submitters on 
specific issues raised by them, FSANZ proceeded to the Final Assessment.  
 
1.2 Basis of the Application 
 
The Applicant is seeking to amend the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of 
Standard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared when present in food as 
an ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food additive or component of a 
food additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing aid.   
 
Specifically, the Applicant is seeking an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
Isinglass is a permitted processing aid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain 
tropical and subtropical fish. A statement such as ‘Produced with isinglass (fish product)’ is 
used to declare isinglass on the label. The exemption was initially sought on the basis that 
isinglass has a long history of use as a fining agent in the production of beer and wine and has 
not been known to cause adverse reactions in fish-allergic individuals.  
 
1.3 Scope of the Application 
 
This Application is specific to the use of isinglass in the production of beer and wine only.  
  
 5
Isinglass, for the purpose of this Application, is defined as a piscine collagen derived 
exclusively from the dried swim bladder of tropical and subtropical fish species for use as a 
fining/clarifying agent in beer and wine. Collagen derived from other parts of fish has not 
been considered in this Application.  
 
1.4 Additional information provided by th e Applicant since Initial Assessment 
 
During Initial Assessment in 2005, FSANZ was aware of a number of scientific studies in 
progress in Europe, USA and Australia aimed at addressing outstanding questions on the 
allergenic potential of isinglass. Results of these studies were made available to FSANZ as 
detailed below.  
 
In February 2008, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that was 
submitted to the European Commission in October 2006 jointly by the BE and the BFBi, in 
support of a request for an extension of the exclusion from Annex IIIa of Commission 
Directive 2005/26/EC beyond 25 November 2007, and thus, from the requirement to label 
isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing. This dossier contained analytical studies and 
clinical trials on isinglass coordinated by FARRP (Food Allergy Research and Resource 
Program), University of Nebraska, USA. Further investigations related to residues of 
isinglass in beer were carried out by Brewing Research International. 
 
In April 2008, the Australian Wine Research Institute and Wine Federation of Australia 
provided relevant scientific information in relation to the use of isinglass in wine. In addition, 
FSANZ requested specific information in relation to the supply and usage of isinglass by 
Australian and New Zealand beer and wine manufacturers.   
 
These documents answered the outstanding questions on the allergenic potential of isinglass 
and enabled the completion of the Draft Assessment of this Application. 
 
2. The Issue 
 
Currently, clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared 
when present in food as an ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food 
additive or component of a food additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing 
aid. This declaration enables fish-allergic consumers to be aware of the presence of any 
potential allergenicity in the food and provides for informed choices in the context of health 
and safety.   
 
The exemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a 
fining agent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse 
reactions in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant has provided evidence that 
dietary exposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption is extremely low. Results of 
oral challenge studies have also been provided indicating that isinglass does not cause an 
allergic reaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher 
than the potential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer 
and wine. Parvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. A new 
Good Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in isinglass has 
also been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. 
  
 6
The issue is whether granting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the 
label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, can have an 
impact on the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers. That is, is consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer or wine likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers and therefore, is the fish-related declaration meaningful to those consumers? 
 
3. Objectives 
 
The specific objectives for the assessment of this Application are to: 
 
• consider the granting of an exemption from the mandatory requirement to declare 
isinglass on the label of beer and wine; 
 
• ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergic to 
fish; and 
 
• ensure adequate label information is provided to fish-allergic consumers. 
 
In developing or varying a food standard, FSANZ is required by its legislation to meet three 
primary objectives which are set out in section 18 of the FSANZ Act.  These are: 
 
• the protection of public health and safety; 
 
• the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make 
informed choices; and 
 
• the prevention of misleading or deceptive conduct. 
 
In developing and varying standards, FSANZ must also have regard to: 
 
• the need for standards to be based on risk analysis using the best available scientific 
evidence; 
 
• the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards; 
 
• the desirability of an efficient and internationally competitive food industry; 
 
• the promotion of fair trading in food; and 
 
• any written policy guidelines formulated by the Ministerial Council. 
 
4. Historical Background 
 
The current mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 were developed during the 
review of the Code, as part of Proposal P161 – Review of Specific Labelling Statements, and 
was gazetted in December 2000. The list of substances included in the Table to clause 4 of 
Standard 1.2.3 is based on the recommendations of an Expert Panel commissioned by the 
then Australia New Zealand Food Authority.   
 7
These substances are: cereals containing gluten and their products, namely, wheat, rye, 
barley, oats and spelt and their hybridised strains; crustacea and their products; egg and egg 
products; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; tree nuts and sesame seeds and their 
products; peanuts and soybeans and their products; and added sulphites in concentrations of 
10 mg/kg or more.   
  
To qualify for mandatory declaration, the substance(s) needed to be recognised by medical 
experts as a frequent cause of severe systemic reactions resulting in significant morbidity or 
mortality. 
 
The justification for the mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 was based on 
the requirement to protect the health and safety of those individuals who are susceptible to 
adverse reactions from certain foods or substances in foods.     
 
Among the substances included in the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3, the Code grants 
exemption from mandatory labelling declaration for beer and spirits made using cereals 
containing gluten.   
 
5. Current Regulations 
 
5.1 Current domestic regulations 
 
5.1.1 Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code 
 
The Standards relevant to this Application are 2.7.2 – Beer, 2.7.4 – Wine and Wine Product, 
1.3.3 – Processing Aids and Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements 
and Declarations. 
 
Alcoholic beverages meet the definition for food in the FSANZ Act and are therefore 
required to comply with the General Food Standards set out in Part 1 of the Code. In addition, 
beer and wine are further regulated by Part 2.7 – Alcoholic Beverages and are defined in 
Standards 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 respectively.  
 
The Table to clause 6 in Standard 1.3.3 permits isinglass to be used as a processing aid in 
food. This Standard defines a processing aid as a permitted substance used in the processing 
of raw materials, foods or ingredients, at the lowest level necessary irrespective of any 
maximum permitted level specified, to fulfil a technological purpose relating to treatment or 
processing, but does not perform a technological function in the final food. The Table to 
clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in 
regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The 
relevant GMP criteria are: 
 
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect;  
 
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and  
 8
(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
The Standard most relevant to this Application is Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 
requires that the presence of fish or fish products in a food must be declared on a label (or 
declared in connection with the display of the food or provided to the purchaser on request 
when a food is not required to bear a label). This requirement is irrespective of the fish or fish 
product being used as an ingredient; a compound ingredient; a food additive; or a processing 
aid.  
 
5.1.2 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
Suggestions were raised by some submitters to the Draft Assessment Report with respect to 
dealing with exemptions for allergens more generically, rather than on the basis of individual 
applications. These are addressed below. 
  
• Possible exemptions from the allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3 should be dealt 
with in a systematic and broader fashion and not through individual applications. 
 
Applications to FSANZ seeking to change the Code are made by individuals, organisations or 
companies. FSANZ is required to respond to and assess each application received. Applying 
general criteria to all possible exemptions from allergen declarations may not be practical due 
to the diversity of products and their applications. The risk assessment process may require 
case specific scientific information, as is the case in this Application. 
 
• Standard 1.2.3 should be reviewed so that there is no requirement to declare products of 
allergens where it can be demonstrated that they do not contain the allergenic protein. 
 
FSANZ considers the above issue to be beyond the scope of this Application. At the request 
of the Ministerial Council, FSANZ has commenced a review of the regulatory management 
of food allergens. The overall aim of the review is to determine whether regulatory and non-
regulatory measures are meeting the needs of allergic consumers in a manner that is practical 
for industry to implement, and that is effective in achieving the objectives of food regulatory 
measures outlined in the FSANZ Act. A number of issues relevant to the regulatory 
management of food allergens are being considered including a framework to identify non-
allergenic ingredients derived from allergenic foods. 
 
5.2 Overseas and international regulations 
 
5.2.1 Codex Alimentarius 
 
The Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods [Codex Stan 1-1985] 
requires the mandatory declaration of substances that are known to cause adverse reactions. 
The list of substances that are required to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’, in 
addition to other major food allergens. The use of isinglass as a processing aid is subject to 
ingredient declaration in accordance with Sections 4.2.1.4 and 4.2.4 of the General Standard 
for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods.  
 
The Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods has been in place for 
many years and no revision relevant to the exemption considered here has taken place as yet.   
 9
FSANZ’s consideration of the labelling exemption for isinglass used in the clarifying process 
of wine and beer is based on the more recent scientific information available and is in line 
with other international regulations. 
 
5.2.2 United States of America 
 
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Food Allergen Labelling 
and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) applies to most domestic and imported 
food and beverage products. However, it is the responsibility of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax 
and Trade Bureau (TTB) to issue regulations with respect to the labelling of wine, distilled 
spirits and malt beverages. In July 2006, the TTB proposed mandatory labelling of major 
food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages. The proposition of mandatory 
allergen labelling parallels amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
contained in the FALCPA.  
 
These proposed regulations were published as an interim rule which allows producers, 
bottlers and importers of alcoholic beverages to voluntarily declare the presence of major 
allergens (including fish and proteins derived from fish). The interim regulations set forth 
mandatory requirements for how such labelling must be applied should an industry member 
choose to do so. The purpose of introducing interim regulations was to allow adequate time 
for consultation on the proposed final regulations whilst encouraging the alcohol beverage 
industry to introduce allergen labelling.  
 
The proposed regulations and interim rule establishes a petition process through which a food 
ingredient may be exempted from the labelling requirements if the ingredient does not cause 
an allergic response that poses a risk to human health or if the ingredient does not contain 
allergenic protein. FSANZ is aware that the TTB is currently considering petitions for the 
exemption of isinglass. 
 
5.2.3 Canada 
 
In February 2004, Health Canada proposed amending the Food and Drug Regulations to 
enhance allergen labelling requirements on pre-packaged foods for specific allergens. This 
proposal included the requirement for mandatory labelling of fish by species name. In 
September 2004, Health Canada amended its original proposal such that fining agents derived 
from fish, milk and egg, used during the manufacture of standardised alcoholic beverages, 
would be exempt from the allergen labelling requirements.   
 
Health Canada recently published its proposed regulatory amendments for allergen labelling 
(including the exemption from labelling for isinglass and other fining agents) in Canada 
Gazette, Part I in July 2008. The final regulations are expected to be published in the Canada 
Gazette, Part II, in early 2009. The exemption was based on a history of use of such fining 
agents and the lack of documented clinical evidence of allergic reactions caused by 
consumption of these products. Health Canada has expressed that it may reconsider its 
position on a labelling exemption for fining agents used in the production of standardised 
alcoholic beverages, should scientific evidence become available suggesting that residues of 
these substances remaining in the final beverage could cause a health risk to susceptible 
individuals.     
  
 10
5.2.4 European Union Member Countries 
 
The European Commission’s Directive 2000/13/EC provides for the possibility of an 
exclusion from the allergen labelling requirement for substances derived from allergenic 
ingredients, for which it has been scientifically established that such substances are unlikely 
to cause an adverse reaction in susceptible individuals. As a result, Commission Directive 
2005/26/EC granted a temporary allergen labelling exemption for specific derivatives of 
allergenic ingredients or substances until 25 November 2007. This provisional list of 
exemptions included ‘fish gelatine or isinglass used as a fining agent in beer, cider and wine’. 
  
During the period of this temporary labelling exemption, industry sectors wishing to make an 
application for a permanent labelling exemption were responsible for submitting research to 
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA received and considered applications for 
a permanent labelling exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in beer and wine 
production.  
 
EFSA considered the information on isinglass used in wine and concluded that ‘the data 
submitted do not allow the Panel to assess the likelihood that isinglass used as fining agent 
will trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals under conditions of use stated by 
the applicant’.  
 
EFSA also considered, separately, information on isinglass used in beer and concluded that 
‘it is not very likely that isinglass used as a clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe 
allergic reaction in susceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use 
specified by the applicant’.  
 
The Commission considered EFSA’s opinions and concluded that a permanent exemption 
from allergen labelling should apply to isinglass used in the production of both beer and 
wine. Annex IIIa of Commission Directive 2000/13/EC was amended by Commission 
Directive 2007/68/EC as of 27 November 2007. This amendment stipulates a revised 
regulatory approach to allergen labelling and includes the requirement that fish and products 
thereof must be declared on a label except fish gelatine and isinglass used as a fining agent in 
beer and wine.  
 
5.2.5 Japan 
 
Japan’s current allergen labelling requirements became enforceable in April 2002 and divides 
allergen labelling into two categories, mandatory and recommended, according to the number 
of cases and degree of seriousness of allergic reactions.  
 
Fish is not included on the list of allergens requiring mandatory labelling (these are eggs, 
milk, wheat, buckwheat and peanuts) and only specific species of fish (salmon and mackerel) 
are recommended for allergen labelling. 
 
Furthermore, alcohol beverages and related products are not subject to the allergen labelling 
requirements. Hence labelling of isinglass and other fining agents used in the production of 
alcoholic beverages is not required in Japan.   
  
 11
5.3 Regulatory differences and its impact 
 
As stated above, labelling exemption for isinglass has already been granted in many 
countries, including all of the European Union member countries. Currently, beverage 
manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand supplying the market in these countries would 
have to meet different isinglass declaration requirements for local and export markets. This 
regulatory difference to labelling may have an impact on trade and increase the costs to 
manufacturers.  
 
6 Matters of Relevance 
 
Details of technical information and analytical data related to this Application are provided in 
the Risk Assessment Report in Attachment 3 and the Food Technology Report in Attachment 
4. This section provides some key information related to isinglass. This information has been 
extracted from the documents provided by the Applicant, the Australian Wine Research 
Institute, and the Wine Federation of Australia.  
 
6.1 Parvalbumin 
 
Parvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. Parvalbumins have 
molecular weights of approximately 10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values
1. Parvalbumins are water 
soluble and resistant to heat treatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975 [as 
cited in Chen et al. 2006]).  
 
6.2 Definition of isinglass 
 
6.2.1 Isinglass definition used by th e Applicant (submission 16 May 2005) 
 
Isinglass is a pure form of collagen, which is derived from the dried swim bladders of certain 
tropical and subtropical fish. In brewing, only isinglass from catfish, croakers and threadfins 
is used.  
 
6.2.2 Isinglass definition from  the BE/BFBi notification 
 
Isinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen. Within the BE/BFBi notification, the term is 
used exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim bladders and does not 
include collagen from fish skins. This notification states that the isinglass used in brewing is a 
pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of a restricted range of specific 
tropical and subtropical fish species. These species are specific catfish, croakers and 
threadfins.  
 
6.3 Components of isinglass 
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denaturation product, gelatin. 
Isinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. 
Collagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass. Only 
residual amounts of the fish protein parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass.  
 
                                                
 
1 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     
 12
6.3.1 Collagen 
 
Collagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish 
muscle, skin and swim bladder. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by 
cross linkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular 
weight of 800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, 
which are usually small, compact proteins with molecular weights ranging between 10 kDa 
and 80 kDa. 
 
Collagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to 
form random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass 
production because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from 
coldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC.   
 
6.4  Commercial production of isinglass 
 
The swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish are used to produce isinglass on a 
commercial scale for use in the alcohol beverage industry. The swim bladder is an air sac, 
located in the dorsal part of the body cavity quite separate from the fish muscle tissue. The 
adherence between the bladder and the body cavity is minimal and as such, it can be readily 
detached without significant contamination with the fish muscle tissue.  
 
6.4.1 Traditional processing method 
 
The traditional basic production process has been reported to vary between manufacturers, 
which can also depend on the source and species of the fish. However, a number of steps are 
considered standard practice. Dried swim bladders are blended according to specific quality 
and other criteria, followed by granulation, washing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen 
peroxide and rinsing. A temperature of less than 15ºC is maintained throughout the wet steps.  
The product is then sold as powder, paste or liquid. The paste and liquid forms include a 
source of sulphur dioxide as a preservative.  
 
As a result of the traditional processing method the final parvalbumin levels in isinglass have 
shown to be reduced by about a half compared to the starting material. 
 
6.4.2 New manufacturing protocol (Good Manufacturing Code of Practice) 
 
The three major European isinglass manufacturers (AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and 
Murphy & Son Ltd) have developed a Good Manufacturing Code of Practice for the sourcing 
and manufacturing of isinglass. This new protocol, which minimises the parvalbumin content 
in isinglass, includes the following additional steps.  
 
• The fish species with high parvalbumin level in the swim bladder have been excluded. 
 
• A granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed      
25 mm has been introduced. This step increases the surface area thus ensuring adequate 
sterilising during peroxide wash and improving the extent of washing out of the 
parvalbumin in the subsequent buffer wash. 
  
 13
• Additional washing steps using phosphate buffer and further water washing have been 
introduced. Phosphate buffer wash has shown to have the greatest effect in reducing 
parvalbumin levels in samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin levels.  
 
All of the isinglass produced by the major European manufacturers supplying to the 
Australian and New Zealand markets is now produced in accordance with the Good 
Manufacturing Code of Practice (new protocol) designed to minimise the levels of 
parvalbumin. 
 
6.4.3 Products used by the Applicant 
 
Based on the information received from the beer and the wine industry, isinglass 
commercially available for their use in Australia and New Zealand is manufactured by the 
European manufacturers AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son Ltd.  
 
FSANZ has also been made aware of the existence of other European companies who are not 
manufacturers of isinglass but resellers or blenders of fining agents who source the raw 
material from the above mentioned manufacturers. In Australia and New Zealand, isinglass is 
predominantly sourced through a local supply network from the European manufacturers, 
blenders and resellers.  
 
6.5 Isinglass as a processing  aid/clarifying agent  
 
6.5.1 History of usage  
 
At Initial Assessment, the Applicant stated that isinglass has been used in the clarification of 
beer and wine for over a hundred years. The dossier submitted by BE/BFBi in 2004 made a 
similar statement and, based on a rigorous literature search, concluded that no isinglass-
related allergy cases have been reported. A further literature search was completed by 
BE/BFBi to identify any reports which might have been published since 2004. No reports of 
allergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish sensitised individuals have been found. 
 
A literature search has also shown no reports of any adverse reactions to wine ingestion that 
is attributable to the consumption of isinglass. 
 
6.5.2 Usage levels in beer and wine 
 
The rod-like structural integrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for 
efficient clarification (Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the 
fining activity is based upon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically 
attract yeast cells with negatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged 
polyphenolic and protein components. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the 
bottom of the container.  In the sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in a 
firm sediment that is resistant to disturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  
 
The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 in the Code specifies the use of Good Manufacturing 
Practice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the food 
(i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  
  
 14
In the brewing process, isinglass is typically added after fermentation and cooling of the beer.  
The typical usage level is 15 mg/L for brewery conditioned beer and 35-60 mg/L for cask-
conditioned beer. Isinglass is subsequently removed by sedimentation followed by filtration 
or centrifugation. Cask-conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or centrifugation and 
relies on gravity settling.  
 
In the wine production process, isinglass is added prior to fermentation to remove phenolic 
compounds from white juice or immediately post fermentation to remove yeast, phenolic and 
tannin compounds from white wine. The typical usage level is 10-25 mg/L for white wines. It 
is assumed that isinglass is seldom used in red and rosé wines. Isinglass is removed by 
sedimentation and filtration. The information provided by the Australian Wine Research 
Institute states that a laboratory trial is undertaken on individual batches of wine prior to the 
addition of isinglass to accurately determine the amount of isinglass to be added so as not to 
result in an over-fined wine. 
 
6.5.3 Residues of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
Isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration or 
centrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.   
 
6.6 Toxicological assessment 
 
Isinglass is a natural product derived from the swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish. 
FSANZ is not aware of any toxicity concerns related to the use of isinglass as a clarifying 
agent. The BE/BFBi notification reports that in addition to being a source of isinglass, the 
fish swim bladders (also known as fish maws) are consumed as food in many parts of the 
world. More than 2750 metric tons are accounted for by such consumption.  
  
7. Key Risk Assessment Questions 
 
What is the evidence in relation to the allergenicity of isinglass?  
 
What is the level of isinglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an adverse 
reaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the final product? 
 
What is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then being 
carried into the final product? 
 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
 
8. Risk Assessment Issues 
 
This section assesses the allergenicity of isinglass and addresses risk assessment issues raised 
by submitters in response to the Draft Assessment Report. The full details of the risk 
assessment are presented in Attachment 3. 
  
 15
8.1 Allergenicity of isinglass 
 
8.1.1 What is the evidence in relation to  the allergenicity of isinglass?  
 
• The three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not of 
clinical importance in IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin, the allergenic fish 
protein of clinical significance, is only present in trace amounts in commercial 
isinglass. 
 
• A number of searches of the published literature failed to identify any reports of 
adverse reaction to wine or beer that can be attributed specifically to isinglass. 
 
• Oral challenge studies have indicated that isinglass manufactured according to either 
the traditional or the new protocol, do not provoke allergic reactions. Two separate oral 
challenge tests have been conducted using twenty-one fish-allergic patients in total. 
None of the patients had positive reactions to the oral challenge tests.  
 
These findings support the conclusion that isinglass is unlikely to pose a risk to fish-allergic 
consumers. 
 
8.2 Presence of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
8.2.1  What is the level of isi nglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an 
adverse reaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the 
final product? 
 
• The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing 
Practice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the 
food (i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  
 
• Isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, 
filtration or centrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.  
 
• Residual amounts of isinglass in bottled and canned beer are below the limit of 
detection, and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/ L. Isinglass residues are 3 mg/L 
for keg beer and 5 mg/L for cask beer.  
 
• The results for wine indicate no residual isinglass has been detected in a small sample 
of commercially available wines fined with isinglass (detection limit 1 mg/L) and made 
following GMP. Therefore, it has been concluded that the concentration of isinglass is 
likely to be less than 1 mg/L. Results of subsequent analysis of isinglass-fined wines 
have supported this conclusion. 
 
• The dose of isinglass, regardless of whether isinglass was manufactured according to 
either the old or new protocol, tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral 
challenge studies, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of 
beer or wine that could be consumed by an individual within a single sitting. 
  
 16
• Parvalbumin would only constitute a minute fraction of isinglass residue in beer or 
wine. This is supported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples 
fined using isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol.  
 
8.3 Potential of parvalbumin partit ioning out into the bulk liquid  
 
8.3.1 What is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then 
being carried into the final product? 
 
The information provided by the Applicant indicates the following.   
 
• Due to the inherent entrapment property of collagen, it can be expected that the 
parvalbumin residues present in isinglass would remain entrapped to a certain degree. 
 
• Parvalbumin is insoluble in the acidic conditions of beer and wine. Analytical testing of 
the sediments indicates that parvalbumin indeed precipitates with the isinglass and is 
removed prior to packaging the final product.  
 
8.4 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
The following issues were raised in relation to the risk assessment for this Application. 
 
• There is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass does not raise any safety concerns for 
fish-allergic consumers. 
 
The Applicant provided information on three clinical studies that have been conducted, in 
Australia and in Europe, to evaluate the effect of isinglass and isinglass-fined wine on fish-
allergic consumers. The three clinical studies, which involved thirty-one fish-allergic patients 
in total, were conducted according to robust protocols. No allergic reactions related to 
isinglass were reported under the conditions of the oral challenges described in any of the 
studies. Taking into account all the other information provided by the Applicant, these results 
support the conclusions that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any 
safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.   
 
Additionally, since 2005 an explicit exemption has been granted from declaration in beer and 
wine by the European Commission. FSANZ is not aware of any health risks or concerns in 
the European Union member countries as a result of this exemption. 
 
• The literature review was based on only one search engine and used only two search 
terms.   
 
The Applicant has provided the outcomes of a total of three literature searches. Information 
on two of the literature searches have been presented in the Initial Assessment Report and the 
Draft Assessment Report. Information on all three searches is now presented in the Final 
Assessment Report. All three searches have failed to identify any publications that may be 
relevant to isinglass allergy. 
 
• There are uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod 
parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived 
isinglass.   
 17
Parvalbumin is a fish protein that appears to be highly conserved among a wide range of fish 
species including cod and tropical fish species.  
 
Analyses comparing available sequences from a range of fish species have demonstrated 
close sequence similarity across many fish species as a general rule, and there is no reason to 
suggest this would not be the case for fish species used in isinglass production. The well 
purified and characterised cod parvalbumin was used to generate polyclonal antibodies to 
parvalbumin, to provide broader specificity, allowing detection of parvalbumin from various 
fish species. Western blot data provided by the Applicant indicates that the cod-parvalbumin 
polyclonal antibodies detected parvalbumin from tropical fish species. The polyclonal 
antibodies were utilised in the cod-based ELISA. In addition, the Applicant also provided 
data where a monoclonal carp-based ELISA was used to detect parvalbumin in various test 
samples. The two methods vary slightly in their sensitivity and specificity, but together they 
provided mutually supporting information on the level of parvalbumin in isinglass.  
 
• The test numbers used in the clinical studies are small and therefore, have limited 
statistical power. 
 
The clinical studies provide information on a total of thirty-one fish-allergic patients, and 
undoubtedly a larger number would have been desirable. However, the fact that the number 
of fish-allergic patients that could be recruited is relatively small, may reflect the prevalence 
of fish allergy in the community. The targeted nature of the recruitment of fish-allergic 
individuals and the strict qualifying criteria applied in the selection of participants, limits the 
number of subjects available to participate in clinical studies. No statistical analysis was 
undertaken due to the small number, however, the studies were conducted according to robust 
protocols and no allergic reactions were reported under the conditions described in the report. 
In this case, the high quality of the clinical testing data obtained using a panel of consumers 
clinically diagnosed to be fish allergic minimises concerns over quantity. These studies, 
which provide an important piece of scientific evidence, were not considered in isolation. 
Together with other evidence, the clinical studies support the conclusions that consumption 
of isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic 
consumers.   
 
• One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed 
potatoes. This trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually 
consumed. In addition, alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food 
allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. 
 
Fifteen fish-allergic individuals, aged between 21-66 years, participated in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled food challenge according to an internationally accepted protocol. The oral 
challenge material was prepared using four doses (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) of 
isinglass in 40 g mashed potato. The use of mashed potato as a matrix made it possible to use 
such relatively high doses of isinglass. This could not be achieved if the oral challenge was 
conducted using isinglass-fined beer or wine based on the extremely low level of isinglass 
(generally below 1 mg/L) in such beverages.  
 
In relation to the role of alcohol in lowering the dose that may trigger an allergic reaction, it 
would have to significantly lower the dose for it to be relevant to the level of isinglass that 
could possibly be present in fined beer and wine (generally below 1 mg/L).   
 18
Also, the study report indicates that all individuals have reported regularly consuming beer or 
wine, at least some of which would have been fined with isinglass, without incident. 
 
This study should be considered in the context of two additional oral challenge studies 
provided by the Applicant. These are briefly outlined: 
 
A second study was conducted on a younger group of fish-allergic individuals, aged between 
6-22 years with isinglass in mashed potato. No allergic reactions were reported in any of the 
six individuals tested up to a dose of 20 mg isinglass.   
 
The third study included ten fish-allergic subjects and each consumed 100 mL of isinglass-
fined or control wine over 10-15 minutes. No subjects developed an allergic reaction 
requiring medical treatment and no abnormalities were noted during follow-up reports. 
 
Collectively, information from all the oral challenge studies presented by the Applicant, 
including those where mashed potato was used as a matrix, support the conclusion of the risk 
assessment.   
 
• The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-
allergenicity. Whilst most known allergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a 
necessary condition for allergenicity. Therefore, this method is unsuitable for assessing 
the allergenicity of isinglass. 
 
Pepsin digestion information was submitted by the Applicant. However, the information was 
not considered in the risk assessment and had no bearing on the risk assessment conclusion. 
Reference to pepsin digestion has been deleted in the Final Assessment Report. 
 
• The data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand 
populations and the threshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are 
unknown. 
 
FSANZ acknowledges the general lack of information on the prevalence of various food 
allergies in Australia and New Zealand. There is currently no consensus on a threshold dose 
for fish allergens. Such information would be a valuable resource and would certainly add to 
the strength of the evidence base for the assessment of isinglass. However, even in the 
absence of such information it is possible to reach a scientific conclusion based on all the 
other information that is available. For example, a published report of a clinical study 
conducted in Australia provides such information. The study, discussed in more detail in the 
Risk Assessment Report, presents outcomes of an oral challenge of ten adult fish-allergic 
individuals with isinglass-fined and un-fined wine. No allergic reactions were reported during 
two hours post challenge and over the following six days.  
 
• There is a possibility of significant under-reporting of allergic reactions due to: 
 
- a lack of awareness among wine drinkers and health professionals of the possible 
presence of fish proteins in wine 
- the tendency to blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse 
reactions occurred 
- the lack of reporting of food allergic reactions to an authority or a medical 
practitioner, especially in adult sufferers  
 19
- the absence of a requirement in New Zealand for food allergic reactions to be 
reported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the 
reaction in a public journal. 
 
Clinical studies discussed above indicate that fish-allergic individuals do not react to isinglass 
or isinglass-fined wine. Also, the extremely low level of isinglass and the even lower level of 
parvalbumin that may be present in isinglass-fined beer and wine argues against these 
suggestions. 
 
• The evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under 
the new code of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in 
the Draft Assessment Report.  
 
The Draft Assessment Report presents analytical data on bottled beer and wine which 
indicates that the level of residual isinglass, if it can be detected at all, is around 1 mg/L. This 
residual level would be expected regardless of whether the isinglass was prepared according 
to the old or new protocol. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-allergic consumers, 
would only constitute a minute fraction of the isinglass residue in beer or wine. This is 
supported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples fined using 
isinglass prepared according to the old or the new protocol. On this basis, information can be 
extrapolated and will be clarified as such in the Final Assessment Report.  
 
• The allergenic fish proteins are normally found in the flesh of the fish, but in some rare 
cases, also collagen can cause allergies. Isinglass contains this particular collagen 
which is found in fish so theoretically it can cause, in select individuals, an 
anaphylactic reaction. 
 
There is no credible evidence to support the clinical relevance of this statement. Collagen is 
not considered by allergy clinicians to be a significant fish allergen and FSANZ is not aware 
of any reports of anaphylactic reactions to fish collagen. The medical literature reports that 
IgE to fish collagen has been detected in only a few Japanese individuals. However, the 
clinical relevance of these findings has not been confirmed by oral challenges. In addition, 
the oral challenge studies presented in the Risk Assessment Report do not support the 
suggestion that collagen is relevant in fish allergy. In two of these studies, twenty-one fish-
allergic individuals of various ages, were challenged with up to 50 mg fish isinglass (collagen 
from the fish swim bladder) within a period of two hours. No allergic reactions were reported 
in any of these individuals.  
 
• The assessment that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely
 to 
present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, does not indicate that 
there is no risk. 
 
Food regulation does not aim to achieve, and can not deliver, zero risk. FSANZ risk analysis 
indicates the consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of 
allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers and therefore it does not require a regulatory 
measure.  
 
• Two submitters objected to providing an exemption as they have experienced allergic 
reactions to wine containing fish products and/or seaweed. 
  
 20
Further information was sought from these submitters. One indicated a seaweed specific 
allergy and no allergy to fish or shellfish. Isinglass is derived from the swim bladders of fish 
and is not a derivative of seaweed. 
 
Additionally, the labelling exemption is specific to isinglass alone, for use as a clarifying 
agent in the production of beer and wine. Isinglass and seaweed are unrelated and therefore, 
the issue raised by the submitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  
 
The other submitter indicated an allergy to fish and shellfish which had been diagnosed by a 
medical practitioner specialising in allergies. This submitter also indicated the use of a skin 
prick test as part of the diagnosis. This submitter was unable to provide the details of the wine 
that caused the allergic reaction except for the information that the product contained a 
statement ‘may contain fish products’. In this case it cannot be categorically concluded that 
the reaction to wine ingestion experienced by this submitter is attributable to isinglass 
without further information and testing.  
 
The scientific evidence shows that isinglass does not raise any health and safety concerns for 
fish-allergic consumers. In addition, as stated previously since 2005 an explicit exemption 
has been granted from declaration in beer and wine by the European Commission. FSANZ is 
not aware of any health risks or concerns in the European Union member countries as a result 
of this exemption. FSANZ is unable to conclude that the allergic reactions mentioned above 
are related to the use of isinglass in the fining process of the wine.   
 
• One submitter indicated that a family member had experienced a severe reaction to fish 
containing a ciguatoxin and continues to experience reactions in circumstances such as, 
when coming into contact with objects such as hand rails which people who have 
handled fish have touched. 
 
Fish contaminated with ciguatoxin causes food borne illness in humans, which is unrelated to 
fish allergy. The Primary Production and Processing Standard for Seafood (Standard 4.2.1) 
regulates the safety of all seafood in Australia, including toxin contamination. In New 
Zealand these requirements are covered by the New Zealand Fishing Industry Agreed 
Implementation Standards. Application A490 deals specifically with the exemption of 
isinglass from the labelling requirements of mandatory allergen declarations in Standard 
1.2.3.  Isinglass and ciguatoxin are completely unrelated and therefore, the issue raised by the 
submitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  
 
8.5 Summary of risk assessment  
 
In summary, the key risk assessment findings include: 
 
• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically 
relevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  
 
• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  
   
• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration 
or centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, 
do not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  
   
 21
• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not 
detectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed 
in the filtration process; and 
 
• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very 
low and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers.  
 
On the basis of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and 
wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.  
 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
9. Risk Management Measures 
 
At Draft Assessment submitters raised their concerns regarding the maintenance of the 
quality of isinglass and its usage, and impact on the provision of information for informed 
choices. These matters are addressed below.  
 
9.1 Maintaining the quality of isinglass  
 
Isinglass is a highly valued clarifying agent and is specifically sought by wine and beer 
manufacturers for its superior functionality compared to other clarifying agents. There are a 
number of market factors that underpin maintenance of high quality isinglass including:  
 
• Isinglass commercially available for use by the beer and wine industry in Australia and 
New Zealand is manufactured by AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son 
Ltd. These are the three major manufacturers supplying the world market. 
 
• These three manufacturers have come together in developing a Good Manufacturing 
Code of Practice, for the manufacture of isinglass low in parvalbumin (new 
manufacturing protocol).  
 
• All of the isinglass produced by these manufacturers is now produced in accordance 
with the new manufacturing protocol. 
 
• The commercially available isinglass referred to above has an established market 
advantage and is widely used by the beverage manufacturers who seek a superior 
functionality. Any quality issues will undermine its status and use in the market place. 
As such, there would be no obvious advantage or incentive for isinglass manufacturers 
to compromise the quality of isinglass.  
 
9.2 Usage of isinglass 
 
The usage of isinglass is regulated in the Code. The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 – 
Processing Aids, specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice in regulating the 
maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The relevant Good 
Manufacturing Practice criteria for isinglass include: 
  
 22
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect; 
  
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and 
(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
Additionally, information from the industry indicates that isinglass is sparingly used as it is 
one of the most expensive fining agents available. 
  
9.3 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
This section addresses risk management issues raised by submitters in response to the Draft 
Assessment Report.  
 
9.3.1  Issues related to the quality and use of isinglass
 
 
• How will the isinglass manufacturing standard be monitored? 
 
• Isinglass could be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards. 
 
There are a number of market factors that support the maintenance high quality of isinglass as 
outlined in Section 9.1.  
 
Due to these factors FSANZ considers market imperatives will serve to maintain the 
provision of high quality product and it is unlikely that isinglass in commercial quantities 
would be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards.  This process 
will inherently be self monitored by industry and its use of product.   
 
• Impose a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing 
protocol, is sourced and used. 
 
Only trace amounts of parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass (from 1µg/g for the new 
protocol to 10 µg/g for the traditional method). For consumers, exposure to isinglass in the 
fined beverage (bottled beer and wine) is unlikely to be more than 1 mg/L regardless of 
which protocol was used to prepare the isinglass. This aspect is already regulated in the Code 
(Standard 1.3.3) for the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent. Accordingly, consumer 
exposure to parvalbumin would be in nanogram levels regardless of whether the isinglass 
manufacturing protocol is old or new. In addition, the oral challenge studies discussed in this 
report indicate that isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol (up to 20 mg and 
50 mg, respectively) did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the fish-allergic participants. 
 
Therefore, imposing a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new 
manufacturing protocol is sourced and used is unjustifiable. Including provisions for 
manufacturing to the new protocol would be unenforceable.  
  
 23
9.3.2 An alternative approach to declaring isinglass 
 
• If beer and wine industry’s concern is the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not 
permit the use of the term ‘isinglass’? 
 
This Application deals specifically with the labelling requirements for mandatory allergen 
declarations. The available scientific evidence shows that isinglass is not likely to cause an 
allergic reaction to fish-allergic consumers. Therefore, FSANZ considers the current 
requirement for the mandatory declaration of isinglass on product labels of beer and wine is 
not warranted regardless of how it may be worded.  
 
9.3.3 Review procedures 
 
• Regular reviews should be undertaken and if reactions do start to occur, amendments to 
the Code should be made. 
 
FSANZ can prepare a proposal to amend the Code based on emerging evidence, as 
appropriate. This would apply to any new evidence relevant to the allergenicity of isinglass 
when used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. 
 
9.3.4 Provision of information beyond allergenicity 
 
• Labelling is required for vegetarians and vegans, and for people with other ethical, 
religious, environmental or personal reasons to make informed choices. 
 
• Removing the labelling requirement would breach current Australian and international 
law regarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans.  
 
• Allowing an exemption for labelling would be misleading and deceptive as it does not 
provide adequate information for consumers to make informed choices for example 
vegetarian/vegan consumers. 
 
• Manufacturers should be required to disclose every ingredient used in the production 
process for all foods. 
 
The purpose of this Application is to seek an exemption from the labelling requirements of 
mandatory allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3. The purpose of allergen declarations is to 
protect the health and safety of those individuals susceptible to adverse reactions from certain 
foods or substances in foods. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of isinglass-fined 
beer and wine, is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers. 
Therefore providing an exemption would enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity 
information, to enable fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. Maintaining the 
status quo on the basis of the consequential use of allergen labelling by vegetarian and vegan 
consumers to make informed choices goes beyond the scope of this Application.  
 
In Australia and New Zealand food manufacturers have the option of providing the food 
suitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans on the label on a voluntary basis and 
may do so as a customer service and to meet the consumer needs. Where manufacturers 
choose to make a voluntary claim of this type, the general provisions in food law and fair 
trading law as they relate to misleading or deceptive conduct, apply.   
 24
Furthermore, if the food suitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans is not 
provided on the label of packaged foods, the supplier can be contacted to obtain this 
information. Standard 1.2.2 of the Code requires the name and address of the supplier to be 
listed on the label, and many suppliers provide a free call telephone number on their labels. 
Additionally, information from several sources such as websites and advocacy groups are 
also available to assist vegetarian and vegan consumers.     
 
A requirement to label packaged foods to enable vegetarians to make informed choices is the 
subject of a separate Application (A545 – Vegetarian labelling), currently being considered 
by FSANZ. 
 
There is no requirement in the Code to declare non-allergenic processing aids in the label. 
Specifically, clause 3 of Standard 1.2.4 does not require the declaration of a substance (other 
than those mentioned in Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3) used as a processing aid in 
accordance with Standard 1.3.3. As such, other animal-derived clarifying agents are not 
required to be labelled. This approach is consistent with ingredient labelling requirements 
internationally. 
 
10. Options 
 
At Final Assessment two options are presented for addressing this Application: 
 
10.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application 
 
Reject the Application, thus maintaining the status quo – this would not allow the exemption 
from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present in beer and wine as a 
result of its use as a clarifying agent.  
 
10.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  
 
Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of the Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the 
requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its 
use as a clarifying agent. 
  
11. Impact Analysis 
 
11.1 Affected parties 
 
The parties likely to be affected by this Application and preferred approach include: 
 
• Consumers of beer and wine who are allergic to fish; 
 
• Industry – Australian and New Zealand manufacturers and importers of beer and wine 
and isinglass manufacturers and distributors supplying to the Australian and New 
Zealand markets ; and  
 
• Government, including the enforcement agencies of Australia States/Territories and 
New Zealand. 
  
 25
11.2 Benefit Cost Analysis 
 
The Benefit Cost Analysis assesses the immediate and potential impacts of each regulatory 
option on the affected parties. 
 
11.2.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application 
 
Under this Option, the status quo would be maintained and the Code would not be amended 
to allow the exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent.  
 
11.2.1.1 Benefits and Costs 
 
 
It is unlikely that maintaining the status quo will greatly impact the identified parties.  As 
beer and wine will continue to be produced and consumed in the current environment, there 
will be no additional benefits or costs to consumers, industry and government. 
 
11.2.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  
 
11.2.2.1 Benefits
 
 
Industry  
 
Granting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, provides the following potential 
benefits: 
 
• provides industry with an additional choice of clarifying agent that does not require an 
allergen declaration, therefore, providing greater technical flexibility without creating 
negative consumer perceptions. FSANZ has been made aware that although isinglass is 
considered a superior clarifying agent, the brewing industry does not currently use 
isinglass due to the mandatory declaration requirement.  
 
• industry will be able to use isinglass without incurring allergen labelling costs. 
 
• beer and wine manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand currently supplying the 
local as well as labelling exempted export markets will not be required to provide 
separate labelling. Similarly wine and beer imported from the labelling exempted 
countries would not require additional labelling.  This reduces costs and enables 
manufacturers to compete more effectively in the global environment.  
 
Consumers 
 
• Removing the requirement to declare isinglass should minimise the confusion between 
perceived and actual risk and contribute positively to a more accurate assessment of 
products among fish-allergic consumers.  
 
• Generally, fish-allergic consumers will benefit in terms of increased choice of beer and 
wine products.  
  
 26
Government 
 
• Enforcement agencies would no longer be required to enforce the mandatory allergen 
declaration for isinglass.  
 
• Since this amendment is not likely to present a health and safety risk to fish-allergic 
consumers the health care expenditure of government will not be impacted.  
 
• There may be further enhancement in consumer confidence in the regulatory system as 
a consequence of the improved accuracy in product allergenicity information due to the 
proposed changes. Enforcement agencies may benefit from this increase in consumer 
confidence.  
 
11.2.2.2 Costs
 
 
Industry  
 
• As the use of isinglass in beer and wine would be a voluntary choice and does not incur 
additional labelling, no additional costs would be imposed on industry. 
 
• Submissions from industry did not identify any added costs.  
 
Consumers 
 
• Consumers will continue to have a broad choice in terms of quality and price points 
across the range of beer and wine in the market place.  
 
• Consumers are not expected to incur additional costs.  
 
Government 
 
• There are no expected costs to government as a result of this amendment to the Code.  
 
11.3 Comparison of options 
 
Options 1 and 2 would continue to protect the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers of 
beer and wine clarified using isinglass. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers.  
Option 2 will provide fish-allergic consumers with an increased choice of beer and wine 
products, and enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity information, to enable fish-
allergic consumers to make an informed choice. This option will also provide the industry 
with greater technical flexibility and ease the presence of international trade obstacles due to 
different labelling requirements. 
 
Overall, a comparison of the options at Final Assessment suggests Option 2 provides greater 
net benefit to the affected parties.

COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY 
 
12. Consultation 
 
12.1 Public consultation 
 
12.1.1 Initial Assessment 
 
The Initial Assessment Report for Application A490 was advertised for public comment from 
5 October to 16 November 2005. In response, FSANZ received twenty submissions, with 
eleven submissions from industry, six from government, and three from consumers. 
 
Overall, eleven of the submitters provided support for the exemption, six objected to 
providing an exemption and one did not provide a preferred option. Of the remaining two 
submitters, one indicated cautious support awaiting results of the safety assessment. The 
other indicated support based on a condition that only isinglass derived from the swim 
bladders of (tropical and subtropical) fish should be exempt.  
 
12.1.2 Draft Assessment 
 
At Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public 
health and safety implications of this Application. The Draft Assessment Report was 
advertised for public comment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. In response, FSANZ 
received twenty-seven submissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from 
industry, two from government and one from a public health organisation. 
 
Overall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to 
providing an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption.  Of the 
remaining two submitters, one indicated support, in principle, for granting exemptions from 
mandatory labelling of ingredients derived from allergenic sources.  However, with regard to 
isinglass this submitter expressed concern that the evidence did not indicate that there is no 
risk.  This submitter was also concerned as to how the manufacturing standard that minimises 
the level of parvalbumin in isinglass will be monitored, and the possible supply of isinglass in 
the marketplace from a manufacturer with less stringent manufacturing standards. 
 
The other indicated support based on a condition that FSANZ consider making it a 
requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of parvalbumin be exempt 
from allergen declaration for isinglass.  
 
A significant proportion of submitters that objected to providing an exemption linked their 
arguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information 
relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. 
The requirement to declare isinglass was considered as enabling consumers to make informed 
choices about foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons. In 
addition, the majority of submitters from this group indicated that they were either a 
vegetarian or vegan or support the provision of information on this basis.  
 
There were two submitters who objected to providing an exemption since they believe they 
had experienced an allergic reaction from consuming wine.

A summary of submissions to the Draft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. 
 
12.2 Targeted consultation 
 
The Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director of 
the Allergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Rob Loblay endorsed the 
FSANZ preferred regulatory approach.  
 
Following an assessment of the comments received to the Draft Assessment Report, targeted 
consultations with submitters on specific issues were conducted. These targeted consultations 
included contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an allergic reaction 
in response to consuming wine.  
 
12.3 World Trade Organization 
 
As members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Australia and New Zealand are 
obligated to notify WTO member nations, where proposed mandatory regulatory measures 
are inconsistent with any existing or imminent international standards and the proposed 
measure may have a significant effect on trade. 
 
The proposed permission has already been granted in some international markets and 
products with similar allergen labelling exemptions are marketed internationally. FSANZ 
considers providing an exemption will further reduce variations between countries and 
facilitate international trade. This position is supported by domestic and international 
submitters from the industry. 
 
Therefore at Draft Assessment, FSANZ considered it was not necessary to notify WTO 
member nations of the proposed amendment under either the Technical Barriers to Trade or 
the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreements. 
 
13. Communication Strategy 
 
Submissions indicated support from industry for the proposed labelling exemption. However 
a significant proportion of other submitters objected to the proposed exemption. The 
objection was based on the provision of information with a particular focus on 
vegetarianism/veganism which is beyond the scope of this Application.  
 
After considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ completed 
targeted consultations to clarify some of the issues raised by submitters. These targeted 
consultations included contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an 
allergic reaction in response to consuming wine.  
 
Issues raised by submitters have been considered and addressed as part of the Final 
Assessment. Should this standard be amended, FSANZ will work closely with Anaphylaxis 
Australia and Allergy New Zealand on messages to inform their members that this measure is 
safe and supported by themselves and allergy specialists. A fact sheet will be placed on the 
FSANZ website.

CONCLUSION 
 
14. Conclusion and Decision 
 
Decision 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and 
wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: 
 
• does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers  
 
• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the 
information related to the allergenicity of the product. 
 
• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products 
 
• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen 
declaration 
 
• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, 
provides a net benefit to affected parties. 
 
The draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. 
 
15. Implementation and Review 
 
The FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food 
Regulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). 
 
Subject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to 
grant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal.

APPLICATION A490 – EXEMPTION OF ALLERGEN DECLARATION FOR ISINGLASS 
Summary of Submissions on the Draft Assessment Report  
 
Submitter  Sector Comments 
AB Vickers Industry • Supports the Application. 
• The robust and comprehensive risk assessment conducted by FSANZ has taken into consideration the best 
scientific evidence that is now available concerning the allergenic potential of isinglass. 
• Until quite recently, a lack of scientific evidence had made it difficult to substantiate any claims regarding the 
likely risk to fish-allergic consumers consuming beverages in which isinglass had been used. Previously, the 
strongest argument in favour on non-labelling was that isinglass had a long history of safe use without a single 
recorded incident of allergic reaction. 
• The scientific studies in the Draft Assessment Report have now confirmed that any residual levels of isinglass 
that may be present are extremely low, if present at all. 
• Clinical trials have further demonstrated that isinglass does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive 
individuals at far higher exposure rates than would be encountered in beers and wines. 
• The isinglass exemption will allow fish sensitive consumers to make informed choices concerning beverage 
consumption and will allow consumers a wider choice of beverages though the removal of a precautionary-
based label approach. 
• The brewing and winemaking industries will also benefit from this exemption through increased flexibility of 
choice in processing (clarifying) aids and isinglass producers will benefit through the increased opportunity to 
trade with Australian and New Zealand beer and wine producers. 
• The Draft Assessment Report acknowledges the regulatory approach to allergen labelling of isinglass in 
several countries where labelling exemption has already been granted. An exemption for isinglass in Australia 
and New Zealand will contribute to increased confidence in allergen labelling statements for those consumers 
who travel globally. 
• A consistency in allergen labelling declarations will benefit beverage manufacturers through simplification of 
labelling strategies and will also benefit isinglass manufacturers who will be able to trade freely with beverage 
companies.

Australian Food and 
Grocery Council 
(AFGC) 
Industry • Supports the Application. 
• Where there is little clinical evidence of allergic reaction and there is a low risk that the substances are 
capable of inducing an allergic response at the concentrations present in the final product, then the product 
should be exempt from mandatory allergen labelling requirements. 
• The AFGC supports the requirement for allergen labelling and the need to inform consumers, and supports the 
FSANZ assessment that isinglass-fined beer and wine, are not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers. 
• However, the AFGC notes the work being undertaken by FSANZ to review the entire standard, and that the 
principles and assumptions on which the standard is based need to be reassessed, in line with this 
recommendation.  Such an assessment would provide a comprehensive reassessment of exemptions to 
allergen labelling, rather than dealing with exemptions in a piece-meal approach. 
Brewers Association of 
Australia & New 
Zealand 
Industry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: 
• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to 
consumers. 
• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the 
beer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. 
• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. 
• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material 
which is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. 
• Where isinglass is not used because of such labelling requirements, the increased unnecessary costs to the 
consumer and the environment resulting from increased filter powder usage. 
• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label. 
• The new and standardised process for isinglass production. 
• In this case, the requirement to label for the presence of isinglass results in misleading information being 
provided to the consumer.

Food Technology 
Association of Australia 
Industry  • The Technical Sub-Committee agreed with option 2 for the exemption of allergen declaration for isinglass, 
however, after much debate also considered the following: 
- Beer and wine had been again exempt from another labelling requirement required on all other foods, the 
rationale for which is still unclear to other food manufacturers as alcohol is no less a nutrient than any 
other of the specified nutrients and alcoholic beverages are part of the average diet of many consumers. 
- Is this application the beginning of similar requests for allergen exempt labelling from other 
manufacturers? 
- It is understood that egg white (albumen) is also used as a clarifying/fining agent in some sectors of the 
wine industry and the labelling of this possible allergen has not yet been discussed. 
Foster’s Group Industry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: 
• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to 
consumers. 
• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the 
beer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. 
• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. 
• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material 
which is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. 
• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label.

Industry • Fully supports the Application. 
• Any labelling for food allergens must take into account whether or not that food will produce an allergic 
reaction and that labelling for all allergen levels may lead to further restricted diets, increased frustration and 
risk-taking and undermining the integrity of labelling statements. 
• Consumers need to trust that allergen labelling information is reliable and not be subjected to misleading, 
precautionary statements that may be ignored based upon, for example, prior experience consuming the food 
product in question without an adverse reaction. 
• A robust, scientifically based labelling allergen schema, which properly identifies those products containing 
allergenic protein likely to cause adverse reaction, will provide consumers with beneficial, non-misleading 
information.  The exemption of isinglass meets and serves these interests. 
• With a global economy and free travel among consumers, determinations made by respective government 
bodies about allergen labelling should not impede trade without serving a public interest. The applicability of 
an allergen labelling requirement for a particular product should be the same from one country to another.  
Consumers will benefit from meaningful allergen labelling statements they can rely upon to make food 
choices whether they are a resident or visiting a particular country. The exemption of isinglass meets these 
goals.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
New Zealand 
Winegrowers (NZW) 
Industry • Supports the Application, based on the information presented in their submission of 16 November 2005 and 
the additional findings of the Report (submission lists Draft Assessment Report findings). 
History of Non-Allergenicity 
• To date, not aware of any incident of a consumer ever having suffered an allergic reaction due to the use of 
isinglass in wine. Nor has any such incident been relayed to NZW from relevant New Zealand health 
authorities.  The absence of any reported allergic reactions was also noted in the EFSA report. 
Usage in New Zealand 
• The average level of isinglass addition in New Zealand is approximately 0.05-0.25 g/L.  Isinglass is used 
sparingly as it is one of the most expensive fining agents available. Both the Draft Assessment Report and the 
Australian Wine Institute submission note that isinglass is not intended to be in the final product and any 
residue is likely to be negligible due to the filtering and racking processes. 
Benefits to New Zealand Producers if Exemption is Granted 
• New Zealand and Australia are the only major wine producing countries in the world that require an allergen 
declaration if isinglass is used in the production of wine. In addition to the concerns of the potential for the 
requirement to create a trade barrier, it is also relevant to consider the unfairness which arises as a result of 
importer non-compliance. Mandatory label statements on all New Zealand wine are verified by the producer’s 
compliance with the Wine Act 2003.  No such system applies to imported wine, many of which bear no 
allergy statement and due to difficulty detecting isinglass residues in wine, it is very likely that a proportion of 
these will have been made using undeclared isinglass. If the exemption is granted, the negative consumer 
perceptions associated with the declaration of fish products will be removed and compliant producers can 
compete on a level playing field with non-compliant users of isinglass. 
• The exemption of isinglass labelling will also: 
- give wine producers the option to choose the best quality clarification option without losing consumer 
confidence; 
- increase consumer choice for consumers who suffer from fish allergies, and 
- reduce costs by removing the need to produce different labels for different vintages and batches or for 
export markets which do not require the declaration of isinglass. 
• A considerable body of evidence and international research supports the key findings of the Draft Assessment 
Report that isinglass raises no safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers when present in wine and beer.  
 36
Submitter  Sector Comments 
The Allergen Bureau Industry • Supports the Application. 
• Considers that the risk to allergic consumers from the consumption of wine and beer treated with isinglass is 
very low, that advisory allergen labelling for the presence of fish does not constitute an effective risk 
management strategy and that the proposed exemption from labelling is justified. 
• Labelling of allergens represents a risk management strategy intended to inform potentially allergic 
consumers to the presence of a hazard in food and thereby enable them to make appropriate food choices. In 
order for this strategy to be effective, the information provided must be understood by, and relevant to, the 
consumer. Where labelling accurately advises of the presence of an identified allergen, the use of such 
labelling provides useful information to the consumer. However, the use of allergen advisory labelling in 
relation to a food component that does not contain the allergen moiety devalues the benefit of allergen 
labelling. This unnecessarily limits consumer choice and is likely to confuse consumers and can potentially be 
misunderstood or ignored. 
• This recommendation is consistent with the recent conclusion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, 
Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that ‘it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a sever allergic reactions in susceptible individuals’ (reference 
provided). 
• As identified by FSANZ, the major components of isinglass are type 1 collagen, gelatin and small quantities 
of elastin.  The Bureau is not aware of evidence to suggest that these components are clinically relevant to fish 
allergies.   
• The level of parvalbumins in isinglass is reported in the EFSA evaluation and the FSANZ Draft Assessment 
Report to be very low, in the range 1-34 ppm. The introduction of a modified preparation procedure for 
isinglass has the potential to yield concentrations up to 10-fold lower and consistently below 1 ppm. 
• During the development of the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) procedure for 
labelling of the presence of cross-contact allergens in food, the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels 
(LOAEL) for total fish protein of 1-100 mg were identified (reference provided). The lower end of this range 
was used in establishing the first action levels. At this level, subjective responses such as numbness or pruritis 
at the site of contact or general uneasiness may be reported by sensitive individuals, although these cannot be 
verified by observers in clinical studies.  The first VITAL action level separates Action Level 1 at which it is 
considered a precautionary advisory statement is not required and Action Level 2 at which a precautionary 
advisory statement is required. In another comparison of clinical studies, the lowest reported provoking dose 
was identified as 5 mg (reference provided). Based on parvalbumin concentration in fish muscle of 4000 g/g 
or 0.4% (reference provided), a consumer would need to drink unrealistic amounts of beer (80 L of cask beer 
or 200L of packaged beer) to consume an amount of parvalbumin consistent with exposure to 1 mg total 
protein, that at which only mild subjective reactions are observed in clinical trials.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
New Zealand Food 
Safety Authority 
(NZFSA) 
Government • Supports option 2 for the exemption of isinglass subject to the following condition: 
• FSANZ should consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of 
parvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration for isinglass. This could be achieved, for example, through 
an industry guideline or Code of Practice, requiring wine and beer manufacturers to comply with the ‘new 
code of GMP’ (Good Manufacturing Practice) for the sourcing and use of isinglass as outlined in the Report. 
Reasons for suggesting a condition 
• The Report states that the three major European manufacturers of isinglass have developed a common code of 
GMP for the sourcing and manufacturing of isinglass (‘new code of GMP’) to reduce the parvalbumin content 
in isinglass. The Report also states that the Application claims that nearly 100% of the isinglass used in New 
Zealand and Australia is sourced from these three manufacturers. NZFSA is concerned that ‘nearly all’ is not 
ALL, therefore, some isinglass used in the production of wine and beer in New Zealand and Australia is not 
sourced from the three European manufacturers using the ‘new code of GMP’. There is also no guarantee that 
imported wines use isinglass manufactured to this new Code.  Isinglass not manufactured under the ‘new code 
of GMP’ is considered to contain higher levels of parvalbumin and therefore, puts fish-allergic consumers at a 
higher risk of having an allergic reaction. 
Additional Comments on the Draft Assessment Report 
Correct use of the term GMP 
• Throughout the report the term GMP has been incorrectly referred to as Good Management Practice.  The 
term GMP applies to Good Manufacturing Practice which is a different practice to Good Management 
Practice. 
Risk Assessment 
• Agrees with the conclusion in the FSANZ risk assessment that if industry uses isinglass prepared under the 
industry agreed GMP, then the risk of exposure to fish allergens is expected to be extremely low. 
• Some concerns in relation to the evidence supplied by the applicant on which this risk assessment was based 
and asks that these be addressed in the Final Assessment Report. These same concerns were raised in the 
Opinions of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety 
Authority (the Panel): 
- While there have been few if any documented reports of adverse events that can be attributed to fish 
allergy from consuming wine or beer fined with isinglass, it should be noted that there could be a 
significant underreporting of reactions because it is uncertain whether wine drinkers and health 
professionals have been aware of the possible presence of fish proteins in wine.  
- The literature review was based on one search engine and used only two search terms.  The Panel noted 
certain limitations associated with the restricted search strategy used. This would not support the statement 
in the Report that a comprehensive literature search was undertaken.  
 38
Submitter  Sector Comments 
- The Panel noted that there were ‘uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod 
parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass’.  
Therefore, testing for residual isinglass should be treated with caution. 
- The results of the clinical studies need to be treated with caution as the test numbers are small and 
therefore, have limited statistical power. 
- One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed potatoes. The Panel 
noted that this trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually consumed. In addition 
it noted that alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food allergic reaction in susceptible 
individuals. 
- The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-allergenicity.  The 
Panel noted that this method is ‘unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass’. Whilst most known 
allergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a necessary condition for allergenicity. 
Summary 
• Notes that the Panel took a cautious approach when presenting its opinions on the isinglass exemption, 
particularly where there was insufficient information available on which to base an opinion. Despite this a 
permanent exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in both beer and wine was granted in 2007. 
• Assume that the evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under the new 
code of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in the Report. Asks that FSANZ 
provide the scientific evidence in the Final Assessment Report that would support this extrapolation. Without 
this evidence believes there is a sound basis to impose the condition with regulatory option 2 as proposed by 
NZFSA.  
• Essential that regular reviews are undertaken and if necessary, amendments are made, especially if reactions 
do start to occur. 
Queensland Health Government • Does not support the Application. 
• Response made by Queensland Health representing whole of Queensland Government. 
• Need to err on the side of caution particularly where in relation to the following key assessment findings: 
- ‘parvalbumin is….possibly the sole allergen for most individuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish’ 
- ‘the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new protocol has been shown to be 
extremely low…’ 
- ‘a significant amount of isinglass introduced in beer and wine is removed allowing only a residual amount 
of isinglass to remain…’ 
- ‘parvalbumin….is unlikely  to be present in the bulk of beer or wine….’ 
  
 39
Submitter  Sector Comments 
- ‘the residual amounts of isinglass that are shown to remain in beer and wine are well below the isinglass 
dosage used in oral challenge tests…’ 
• Notes the Codex general standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods. The list of food allergens that are 
required to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’. There are no exemptions to these labelling 
requirements. In addition, there are variations in approaches between countries. 
• In addition, ‘the data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand populations and the 
threshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are unknown’ (Report, p22). 
• There would be a significant under-reporting of reactions (if any) against the substances in wine, as most wine 
drinkers and health professionals are probably unaware of the possible presence of isinglass. They would most 
likely blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse reactions occurred. 
• Dr Andreas Lopata from the Allergy Research Group at RMIT University stated in an ABC radio interview on 
Thursday, 2 October 2008 that, ‘It is not really known if isinglass itself actually can cause an anaphylactic 
reaction in fish-allergic people. The major allergens in fish are normally found in the flesh of the fish but in 
some rare cases also collagen can cause allergies. And isinglass contains this particular collagen which is 
found in fish so theoretically it can cause in select individuals….an anaphylactic reaction.’ 
• The first of the reasons for preferred approach by FSANZ to grant an exemption is that it ‘does not raise any 
safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.’ However, the second objective for the assessment of the 
application is to ‘ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergenic to 
fish.’ Is there any reason why only safety is referred to in the reasons for preferred approach? 
• Allowing an exemption will undermine the provision of adequate information on the product label to make an 
informed choice by vegetarians and vegans who will find the ‘extremely low’ levels of isinglass present in 
beer and wine as unsuitable for vegetarian diets. 
• Research commissioned by the Sanitarium Health Food Company in 2000 found 2% of Australians reported 
being vegetarian. 
• It is of little use in addressing the vegetarian/vegan issue by stating ‘FSANZ is considering Application A545 
on vegetarian labelling.’ The Work Plan on FSANZ website notes that it was received on 23 August 2004, 
starting in 4th quarter of 2006 and initial assessment to the Board in February 2009. Accordingly, clarification 
is requested. 
• It is disappointing that FSANZ chose not to show this cost in the benefit cost analysis since the issue of 
vegetarian labelling was identified following the release of the Initial Assessment Report. 
• Resources across government, industry and other stakeholders could be better utilised if the issue of allergen 
declaration generally was addressed at one time rather than by a ‘case-by-case’ type basis.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Allergy New Zealand Public Health • Supports, in-principle, the granting of exemptions of mandatory labelling, as long as there is undisputed 
evidence that the ingredient: 
- is proven to be clinically safe for all individuals allergic to that allergen, and 
- has been manufactured to strict standards that are monitored and assured by the regulatory authority who 
has granted the exemption. 
• Concerned that there is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass ‘does not raise any safety concerns for fish-
allergic consumers’ as stated in FSANZ’s reasons for preferred approach.   
• Accepts that evidence to date indicates that isinglass-fined beer and wine are not likely to present a risk of 
allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, however, this does not indicate that there is no risk. 
• The FSANZ report states that there are no documented reports of allergic reactions to beer or wine fined 
isinglass in fish-allergic consumers. However, many food-allergic reactions are never reported to an authority 
or medical practitioner. Furthermore, there is no requirement in New Zealand for food-allergic reactions to be 
reported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the reaction in a published journal.  
Therefore, questions the safety of this being used as evidence of no risk. 
• Two areas of concern regarding the manufacturers of isinglass and use in the wine and beer industry: 
- how will the manufacturing standard be monitored, and 
- wine and beer manufacturers may source isinglass from another manufacturer in a country with less 
stringent manufacturing standards. 
• Fish-allergic individuals are entitled to make an informed choice. 
• If beer and wine industry’s concern is borne out of the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not permit the 
use of the term ‘isinglass’? This will only be of concern to those consumers who are allergic to fish, who 
would then be advised to avoid products using isinglass. 
• With ongoing research internationally, the situation may become a lot clearer in regard to the risks to fish-
allergic consumers of isinglass-fined wine and beer. It is therefore recommended that FSANZ, in whatever 
decision it takes in regard to this Application, undertakes to review it within 5 years, or sooner if clearer 
evidence becomes available.

Daniel Beecher Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• FSANZ legally required to act in consistency with Australian and international law, regardless of the limited 
scope of Application A490.  As such, despite being beyond the scope of the application, the following 
objections are immediately relevant to FSANZ’s review of Application A490, since they are directly relevant 
to the legality of FSANZ’s proposed outcome. 
• FSANZ’s reasons are irrelevant to the issues raised in this submission. The relevant facts are: 
1.  that the previous decision was the only legally valid decision that FSANZ could make, and 
2.  that FSANZ would be breaking the law by overturning the previous decision 
3.  any past oversights of FSANZ’s legal responsibilities should not be used as an excuse for making further 
breaches of Australian law 
• For FSANZ to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass would be a breach of current Australian law 
regarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans. Particularly human rights and anti discrimination laws, 
statutory bills of rights, and UN conventions. 
• The onus is now upon FSANZ to immediately consider the impact of their actions (such as the proposed 
approval of Application A490) upon the legally protected human rights of vegetarians and vegans. As such, 
the submitter formally requests that FSANZ immediately desist from approving the Application, or from 
making any other decisions that allow food manufacturers to reduce or remove the capacity of vegetarians or 
vegans to be aware of animal derived ingredients within foodstuffs. 
• The submission provides references (available upon request) to current law that would be contravened if 
FSANZ were to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass. 
Linda Cuthbertson Consumer • Does not support the Application as a vegetarian. 
• In order to select wine, the label is checked for fish products and bottles are excluded that fits that category. 
• It is becoming increasingly difficult to find wines that do not include fish products but the statement on the 
label enables wines to be chosen that are suitable for vegetarians. 
• It would be more useful if the label was more specific; the words ‘may contain’ are somewhat vague. 
• The warning should be retained for dietary purposes so that vegetarians are able to select wines that have no 
fish content.  
 42
Submitter  Sector Comments 
Emma Delaney Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• As a vegan, relies on labels being truthful to make an informed decision. If not informed of a particular 
ingredient, such as a fish product, it is not clear if the product is vegan. 
• The ingredient could cause an allergic response in some individuals, even if reaction may only be mild it 
should be up to the individual with the allergy to decide if they are going to take the risk, not up to companies 
who do not want to lose profits. 
• The consumer deserves to know exactly what it is that they are consuming whether they avoid certain 
ingredients due to ethical reasons, health reason or other reasons.  
• If fish products are taken off beer and wine labels, the submitter will no longer try new wines as will not be 
able to trust that the label is truthful and the only choice will be to assume that fish has been used. Therefore, 
the submitter will only buy wines that are labelled as vegan. This will affect the consumer and the profits of 
the companies involved. Consumers with an allergy to fish would make a similar decision.  
Lynsey Edgar Consumer • Does not support the Application as a wine consumer who is very allergic to fish. 
• Suffered an allergic reaction 6 months ago and another time subsequently whilst drinking white wine. On both 
occasions, the label indicated that fish products were used in the clarifying process. 
• If exemption is permitted, it will be impossible for consumers to determine if fish products are present. How 
are consumers who are allergic to fish, ever to be sure they will not experience a reaction to white wine?  
Information on the label is the only way to be sure, prior to drinking wine, that the consumer will not 
experience an allergic reaction. 
• Consumers are entitled to full disclosure of the food products used in producing wine, to make an informed 
decision, particularly where the decision can affect their health. 
• If exemption allowed, the consumer will have to maintain own ‘safe’ list of wines that they can consume. This 
will curtail purchasing choices as they will not stray from list of known, non-allergy inducing wines. 
Eleanor Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Sister ate a fish that contained an almost lethal dose of ciguatera toxin. She was hospitalised and semi-
conscious for a week and not mentally herself for 6 months following. 10 years later she experienced another 
reaction from paper handled by another person who had eaten fish and continues to get these types of 
reactions from other people who have handled fish. The toxin firstly stops her thinking but still functioning 
and then stops her functioning. Therefore, anything that contains fish derived items should be labelled for the 
wellbeing of all.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Diane Francis Consumer • Does not support the Application.   
• As a vegetarian, does not consume fish and therefore, relies on correct labelling of food and beverage 
products. 
• Why should wine be exempt from responsible labelling? 
Ron Hewit Consumer • Does not support the Application due to vegan interests. 
• The exemption of isinglass labelling in wines will prevent people not wishing to eat fish products from 
consuming any wine as they cannot tell from the label. 
• Labels must state if traces of egg whites are used (as opposed to bentonite or similar clarifiers), so there 
should not be any exemption for fish products.  
• Other foodstuffs from soups, biscuits and noodles must state if fish or crustacea are included in the product. 
This permits a choice for those who do not wish to consume these products whether for allergenic, religious, 
health, or animal welfare reasons.  
• Without the isinglass labels, wine that does not include this product will be penalised because some people 
will not purchase any wine for fear of unlabelled isinglass traces.  
• It seems a poor reason to request an exemption just because wine makers don’t wish to include a fish product 
label.   
• All foodstuffs should be labelled with all products, it helps indicate the cleanliness and purity of the 
manufacturing process; traces of unpleasant products should be declared, people need the choice.  
Ruth Jackson Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Removing isinglass from labelling will not allow consumers to make informed choices about purchasing beer 
and wine.  
• Ethics in business is not fundamentally a question of whether it is right or wrong to tell the truth…rather 
ethics in business is fundamentally a question of implementing and maintaining communication systems 
which question, discuss and validate ethical claims.  
• Exempting isinglass from labelling effectively takes away the ability of each individual to judge for 
themselves whether they want to consume a product that contains fish. It is misleading or deceptive because it 
does not provide adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices.  
• Submitter does not want to drink beer or wine with fish products, so the only option would be to stop drinking 
alcoholic products unless know they do not contain isinglass.  
• It is honest to label what is in a product, no matter how minute it is.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Lynda Kriflik Consumer • Does not support the Application for vegetarian/vegan interests. 
• The removal of notification of isinglass in wines is problematic for another group of consumers other than 
those that suffer allergies. Consumers who choose not to eat or intake animal products will be severely 
disadvantaged by the removal of warnings indicating that isinglass was used as the refining agent.  
• Failure to advise consumers of the refining agent is inadequate ‘provision on the product label to make 
informed choices’ by any consumers. 
• Vegetarians/vegans use label information to avoid products that contain rennet or gelatin, both animal 
products, and expect that labels would also allow them to avoid fish products, regardless of the quantity, as 
they choose not to include any ‘fellow creatures’ in their diet.  
• Submitter has contacted several viniculturalists to express concern that such advice is an ethical recognition of 
the right to choose dietary intake. 
Lefki Pavlidis Consumer • Strongly disagrees with the Application.  
• Wishes to know all the ingredients contained in any product for human consumption. 
• The small traces of fish in beer & wine may or may not cause allergic reactions in people with fish allergies, 
but FSANZ must also consider the many people who choose not to consume anything that contains animal 
ingredients for ethical reasons.  
• Manufacturers should be up-front and provide a full list of ingredients used in the production of their 
products, so consumers can make the right purchasing decisions according to ethical beliefs. 
Kathryn Puxty Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Labelling is essential for vegetarians and vegans to be able to make an informed decision about which wines 
they can and can't drink to follow their chosen diet. Whether or not there are significant traces remaining in 
the wine is irrelevant. The fact that it has been produced using fish (or milk or eggs) is sufficient to make it 
unsuitable. If this exemption goes ahead then the range of wines that vegetarians and vegans can drink will be 
greatly limited as we won't know what is suitable and what is not.  
• If this exemption is granted then an acceptable, or perhaps preferable, alternative would be to make it 
mandatory to label all wines, or in fact all alcohol, as being suitable for vegetarians and vegans. This is 
something that many food brands currently do, though they are not obligated to do so.  
• The wine industry is overreacting the negative reaction of general consumers to the labelling of fish products, 
since rarely anyone ever reads the labels, and those that do are people with allergies or special diets that make 
label and ingredient checking a normal part of life. 
• If labelling is going to be insufficient then the only other option is to avoid products that we cannot be sure 
about. This will also have a negative impact on many producers in the wine and alcohol industry.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Penny Rankin Consumer • Does not support the Application as an allergy sufferer. 
• The argument that the amount of fish products in wine is so small they could not be harmful is not true. 
• Submitter experienced an allergic reaction after only 2 sips of wine containing fish products and seaweed and 
now checks wine labels very carefully.  Submitter is dangerously allergic to seaweed which causes angio 
oedema and can be fatal. 
• Need to ensure labels continue to list ingredients such as isinglass, fish products and seaweed, so allergy 
sufferers can avoid them and stay alive without requiring emergency tracheotomies. 
Jessica Robinson Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• In the interests of both consumers who have, for ethical, religious, or personal reasons, an opposition to the 
use of fish products in their consumables, and also the general public for the basic reason that every consumer 
has a right to know exactly how a product has been produced.  
• People who have adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet do not purchase beer or wine that has been brewed using 
isinglass. If there are no standards, these groups of people will not know which products are appropriate for 
them, causing unnecessary stress, uncertainty and inconveniences. 
• Understands that the association has concerns that consumers may be put off purchasing a product if they read 
that it has been produced using fish products. However, it is essentially the responsibility of the consumer to 
educate themselves in the process of beer and wine production, and omitting certain information from the 
labels is insulting to the informed consumer and a tactical cover-up of the truth. It does not change the fact 
that these products are used. If a consumer takes issue with the production process then they have the right to 
research and make an informed decision about where they place their purchasing power.  
• It is quite clear that the driving force behind the application is the prospect of higher sales for the beer and 
wine industry, and accepting their proposal would mean sacrificing the moral duty of a producer of 
consumables to be truthful. 
John Wakerman Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Whilst labelling may or may not be important for those with fish allergies, it is important for those who 
simply wish to be informed about what they consume, in whatever concentration. Accurate labelling is also 
important for those with religious or other beliefs, be they Muslims or vegans.  
• Where isinglass is used and residual is to be found in beers or wines, it should be thus labelled, regardless of 
allergenicity. Only thus will consumers be able to make informed choices and not be misled about the content 
of common foodstuffs or drinks.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Tara Ward Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Submission focuses on the objectives of FSANZ, specifically ‘the provision of adequate information relating 
to food to enable consumers to make informed choices’. 
• The focus of the application and Draft Assessment Report was limited to consumers of beer and wine who are 
allergic to fish.  This submission considers the impact on all consumers of beer and wine, rather than merely 
those who are allergic to fish. 
• The requirement to declare isinglass on beer and wine labels allows consumers to make informed choices 
about food based on political, religious and/or ethical preferences, including preferences not to purchase 
products made using animals or fish.   
• To date, a major obstacle for consumers wishing to make informed food choices has been improper or 
insufficient labelling. The preferred regulatory approach of granting the exemption will only exacerbate this 
trend.  In the absence of mandatory labelling systems for products containing, or produced with, animal or 
fish products, this submission urges that exemption not be granted. 
• According to the Report, the requirement to declare the use of isinglass does not provide accurate information 
for fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. It is difficult to understand how the declaration on a 
label of factual information regarding the production system associated with a product does not count as 
‘accurate’ information. 
• The mandatory requirement regarding isinglass is not to make assertions about the possibility of an allergic 
reaction to it, but merely to declare that it was used in the production of food in question.  Removing such 
factual information would diminish the ability of consumers to make an informed choice, as it would conceal 
the nature of the process used to produce the food. 
• Retaining the existing limitations of the requirement avoids the need to alter the information on labels 
according to the changing nature of research findings regarding isinglass and/or the changing social 
conscience of consumers. 
• If there is concern about the general level of awareness regarding the potential (or lack thereof) for allergic 
reactions to isinglass, it would be better to continue the requirement to declare its use, and as well to provide 
additional information on relevant websites and other sources. 
• Should the requirement to declare isinglass be removed, it would reduce choice for consumers who do not 
wish to buy wine or beer where it is unclear whether its production involved the use of isinglass. If consumers 
concerned about the use of fish products were to cease purchasing wine or beer that does not declare the 
presence of isinglass, this may result in a cost to certain sectors of the industry.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Sharnie Wu Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Submitter spoke to the allergy clinic at Royal Price Alfred Hospital since original submission, who suggested 
that isinglass is not a major allergy threat. 
• Therefore, the main reason to label is the need for transparency for consumers who want to know what the 
product inputs are. Isinglass uses an animal product and consumers need to know this to make informed 
choices with their purchase. 
• Many vegetarians and vegans would not buy these wines if they knew that fish had been killed in the process 
of making them. It is their right to know what they are buying. People have a fundamental civil right to know 
the truth of what they are putting into their own bodies and make the appropriate decisions. 
• It is up to the wine industry to market appropriately to avoid the stigma of using fish products. 
• Also for consideration is the possible environmental impact of using isinglass. In this world of fish 
populations being severely depleted by overfishing, climate change and ocean pollution, is it absolutely 
necessary to use fish for an incremental gain in the taste of wine which the wine producers are too 
embarrassed to tell the public about? 
• The ultimate goal of FSANZ is ‘A safe food supply and well-informed customers’. The people of Australia 
and NZ hold FSANZ to this task.

Risk Assessment Report  
 
Definition:  Isinglass is a processing aid derived from the swim bladder of tropical and 
subtropical fish species for use as a fining/clarifying agent. 
 
Risk Assessment 
 
1. General 
 
1.1 Fish allergy - parvalbumin 
 
Allergy to vertebrate fin fish is well documented in the scientific and clinical literature, 
including double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies. Fish muscle, 
skin and roe have been reported to cause allergic reactions, the latter only rarely (Sicherer et 
al., 2000; Escudero et al., 2007). Allergic reactions to the consumption of fish/fish products 
may include life-threatening anaphylaxis. Fish allergy reportedly affects 0.4% of the US adult 
population (Sampson, 2004); but there are currently no data on the prevalence of fish allergy 
in the Australian and New Zealand adult population.   
 
Parvalbumins are a class of calcium-binding proteins found at highest concentration in fast 
contracting/relaxing muscle fibres of vertebrates. In fish, parvalbumins are generally 
associated with skeletal muscle. Parvalbumins have molecular weights of approximately  
10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values
2. Parvalbumins are water soluble and resistant to heat 
treatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975-[as cited in Chen et al. 2006]).  
 
Parvalbumins are the allergenic fish proteins, and possibly the sole allergens for most 
individuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin is the allergen in several fish 
species including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel and tuna. Parvalbumin sequences from 
commonly consumed fish species are highly homologous. This would indicate a high 
likelihood of IgE cross-reactivity to a range of fish species for at least some fish-allergic 
individuals (Swoboda et al., 2002; Hilger et al., 2004; Van Do, 2005).  
 
There is limited information on the potential allergenicity of fish collagen. In a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) study, a mild, subjective reaction was reported 
by one out of 30 fish-allergic patients given 7.6 g codfish skin gelatine (Hansen et al., 2004).  
 
1.2 Fish swim bladder – anatomical location and tissue composition 
 
The swim bladder is an air sac located in the dorsal part of the body cavity of most fish 
species. As such, it can be readily detached without significant contamination with the fish 
muscle tissue. The swim bladders from certain tropical and subtropical fish species are used 
to prepare commercial isinglass.  
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denatured product, gelatin. 
Isinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. 
Collagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass.
                                                
 
2 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     
 49
There is no evidence to suggest that elastin is allergenic and, as mentioned above, the clinical 
relevance of collagen/gelatin allergenicity has not been shown.   
 
Collagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish 
muscle, skin and swim bladder. The fish swim bladder is the source of collagen, known 
commercially as isinglass. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by cross 
linkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular weight of 
800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, which are 
usually small, compact proteins with molecular weight ranging between 10 kDa and 80 kDa. 
 
Collagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to 
form random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass 
production because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from 
coldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC. There is no evidence that gelatin is a clinically 
important allergen in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
1.3 The hazard and the risk  
 
For fish-allergic consumers, fish parvalbumin is the relevant allergen of significance i.e. the 
hazard. The FSANZ risk assessment process considers that the hazard is the potential
 to 
cause an adverse reaction and the risk is the likelihood of the adverse reaction actually 
occurring within the conditions of exposure. In the context of this Application, the overall 
risk to fish-allergic consumers is dependent on the level of exposure to parvalbumin through 
the consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine.   
 
2. Beer-related data 
 
Information in this section is mainly extracted from documents provided by the Applicant to 
FSANZ in 2008 (originally submitted by the Brewers of Europe and the Brewing, Food and 
Beverage Industry Suppliers Association to EFSA in 2006).  
 
2.1 Analytical methods used in beer studies 
 
2.1.1 Isinglass detection   
 
A method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in fined beers can be 
concentrated using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to pure isinglass. The separated 
isinglass can then be hydrolysed to its constituent acids and quantified by measuring the 
content of hydroxyproline, an imino acid characteristic of animal collagens. The limit of 
detection (LOD) of this method is 0.17 mg isinglass/L of beer. Information provided by the 
Applicant indicates this method was used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues 
which could be present in beer. 
 
2.1.2 Parvalbumin detection   
 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fish parvalbumin was used to measure 
parvalbumin levels in swim bladders, isinglass and beer. Using monoclonal antibody directed 
against carp parvalbumin, a competitive ELISA was developed and found to be capable of 
detecting 0.05 µg/ml of carp parvalbumin (or 1 µg/g).  
  
 50
An improved method was developed based on anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibodies 
which would have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider range of fish 
species. The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not substantially cross-react with 
common food ingredients. The sensitivity of the anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA was shown to 
be 0.20 µg/g. However, using the sandwich ELISA to measure parvalbumin levels in 
isinglass samples suggests the possibility of matrix inhibition of two to four-fold. Therefore, 
quantitative estimates of parvalbumin levels need to take this into account.    
 
2.2 Parvalbumin in fish swim bladd er and in isinglass preparations 
 
Although parvalbumin is not a major component of the swim bladder, it has been identified in 
the swim bladder tissue of a western Atlantic fish (Opsanus tau or the oyster toadfish), a 
species not used in isinglass production. This information raised the question whether 
parvalbumin may also be present in the swim bladders of some fish species that are used in 
the commercial production of isinglass. The Applicant provided analytical data on 
parvalbumin levels in eight isinglass samples from three commercial manufacturers. Using 
the anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA, six samples were below 10 µg/g, one sample at 34 µg/g and 
one below 1 µg/g. Various levels of parvalbumin were detected in the swim bladder of seven 
fish species. According to this information, it is possible to minimise the level of parvalbumin 
in isinglass by identifying and eliminating fish species with high levels of parvalbumin.   
 
Parvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions, at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, 
making it possible to further minimise residual levels of parvalbumin in isinglass by 
incorporating a washing step in the manufacturing process. The Applicant provided analytical 
data which indicates that significant reduction of residual parvalbumin in isinglass is 
achieved after washing with a phosphate buffer. The effect of different washing procedures 
on parvalbumin levels was tested. The most effective washing process appears to reduce 
parvalbumin level by about four-fold.  
 
To ensure minimum parvalbumin content in isinglass, the Applicant indicated that a new 
Code of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the manufacture of isinglass low in 
parvalbumin has been developed and agreed by the industry. The new GMP Code 
incorporates an additional washing step using phosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving 
step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed  
25 mm, and the exclusion of fish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. 
Data presented by the Applicant shows that parvalbumin residues in eight samples of 
commercial isinglass, prepared using the new GMP, are below 1 µg/g.  
   
2.3 Residues of isinglass and parvalbumin in fined beer 
 
Information provided by the Applicant states that residual amounts of isinglass in bottle and 
can beer are below the LOD and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/L. For keg and cask 
beer, isinglass residues are at 3-5 mg/L.  
 
Experiments were conducted using ELISA methods in order to determine whether detectable 
parvalbumin remained in the fined beer. Samples of beer fined with isinglass, containing 
various levels of parvalbumin, were freeze-dried and tested. Data provided indicates that no 
parvalbumin could be detected in the beer samples, which included lager and cask ale.  
  
 51
Theoretical calculations suggest that parvalbumin levels would be below the level of 
detection of the ELISA method used in these tests.   
 
Since parvalbumin residues in beer are too low to measure, the Applicant provided an 
estimate of potential parvalbumin based on the following information:  
 
• The dose of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/L. This is around the highest dose which 
would be used commercially for cask beers and is 2-3 times higher than the dose used 
for most brewery-conditioned beers.  
• Residual levels of isinglass in beer, when detectable, range from 1 mg/L for can and 
bottle beer to 5 mg/L for cask beer. Even in cloudy beer, the level is not reported to 
exceed 5 mg/L. 
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products currently on the market (old 
protocol) is 10 µg/g (cod equivalent) on a dry weight basis.   
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products using the new GMP protocol is 
1 µg/g. 
• Parvalbumin most likely co-sediments with isinglass residue and does not partition into 
the fluid part of the beer (see section 2.4 below). 
 
Based on this information, parvalbumin levels in beer are calculated to be 0.001 µg/L for 
bottle and can beer, and 0.005 µg/L for cask-conditioned beer using isinglass prepared 
according to the new protocol. For traditionally prepared isinglass, the levels are estimated to 
be ten times higher at 0.01 µg/L and 0.05 µg/L for can and cask beer, respectively. These 
estimated levels of parvalbumin are considered, together with oral challenge studies, in the 
exposure assessment.   
 
2.4 Parvalbumin levels in beer sediments 
 
Parvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions at neutral and alkaline pH. Data 
provided by the Applicant indicates that the level of parvalbumin in isinglass can be 
minimised by washing in buffer solution. For any residual parvalbumin, which is not 
eliminated from isinglass, there are two potential scenarios. Parvalbumin residues would 
either end up in the sediment or in the fluid. In the acidic environment of beer brewing, 
parvalbumin would be expected to precipitate with the isinglass to form the sediment. 
Analytical data provided by the Applicant suggests this to be the case.   
 
Isinglass commercially prepared using the old protocol (which assumes a typical parvalbumin 
content of 10 µg/g as determined by cod parvalbumin ELISA) was added to beer at a dose of 
36 mg/L (0.36 µg parvalbumin/L) of beer. The sediment was collected and tested for 
parvalbumin content using the cod parvalbumin ELISA. The results suggest that parvalbumin 
content in isinglass is concentrated in the sediment and therefore, is unlikely to be present in 
the clear portion of the beer.     
 
2.5 Clinical testing 
 
2.5.1 Skin prick tests 
 
Skin prick testing (SPT) provides information about the presence of IgE antibody specific to 
a given allergen. Although SPT for food allergy is valid, interpretation can be complex and 
positive tests often occur without clinical allergy (ASCIA-SPT Manual 2006).  
 52
The Applicant provided information on skin prick tests performed using extracts from a 
number of the fish species that are used in the manufacture of commercial isinglass. Flesh 
and swim bladder extracts were prepared from six fish species, and checked for microbial 
contamination to eliminate false positive due to non-allergic inflammation. SPT was 
performed on eight fish-allergic individuals according to a protocol developed at the Food 
Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP). Samples of blood were also taken from 
the individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. All eight patients tested were positive 
when skin tested with fish flesh extracts. Seven of eight patients were positive with fish swim 
bladder extracts.  
 
Information was also provided by the Applicant on a separate study conducted in France 
where six patients with verified fish allergy were challenged with commercial isinglass. Two 
of the six patients were skin-test positive, but all six patients were negative in the oral 
challenge test (see below). 
 
These skin prick test results, when considered in conjunction with the oral challenge results 
conducted on the same patients, do not appear to be clinically relevant. This is because 
individuals may have allergen-specific IgE which leads to positive skin prick tests, but do not 
react to oral challenge with the same allergen. This is a well-acknowledged and commonly 
encountered response in food allergy testing.   
 
2.5.2 Oral challenge tests 
 
Controlled oral food challenges are the gold standard in diagnosing food allergy. However, 
the targeted nature of the recruitment and the strict qualifying criteria, including convincing 
clinical history, limits the number of subjects available to participate in such studies.
   
 
In the context of this Application, oral challenges are conducted to determine whether or not 
the test samples (isinglass used as a fining agent) can provoke an allergic reaction in fish-
allergic individuals. 
 
A protocol for DBPCFC tests were developed by FARRP using isinglass prepared according 
to the new protocol. Fish-allergic patients were dosed every half an hour with isinglass 
starting from a low dose and gradually increasing over a period of two hours. The doses used 
were 0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg of isinglass in mashed potatoes. In this study, 15 fish-allergic 
patients were tested but none reacted to the oral challenge with isinglass, even at the very 
highest dose used. Based on parvalbumin content of 1 µg/g isinglass, the total of the 
challenge doses is equivalent to over 50 L of beer (or 10 L of cask beer) exceeding the 
volume that is possible to consume in a single sitting.  
 
Another study was conducted separately in France using isinglass containing 10 µg/g 
parvalbumin.  
According to information provided by the Applicant, this is a typical sample of commercially 
available isinglass. Six patients with allergy to fish, as determined by oral food challenge or 
by a convincing clinical history at the time of the study, were included. Each patient received 
a total of 20 mg of isinglass, mixed with cooked potato, over two hours. None of the patients 
had positive reactions to the oral challenge (while two of the six patients showed positive 
reactions in the skin prick test using the same material). 
  
 53
These two studies, conducted by experts in the field using rigorous protocols, provide 
supporting evidence that isinglass does not pose a safety concern for fish-allergic consumers.    
 
2.6 Exposure assessment 
 
The data suggest that levels of isinglass that may remain in beer do not exceed 1 mg/L for 
bottle or can beer, and 5 mg/L for cask beer. The level of parvalbumin in isinglass is likely to 
vary according to the manufacturing protocol (from 1 µg/g for the new protocol to 10 µg/g 
for the old protocol). No data are available on the level of parvalbumin in beer because it is 
below the LOD for current methodologies. As parvalbumin is known to be insoluble in the 
acidic environment of fermentation, it is expected to co-sediment with isinglass which is 
removed during the beverage production and is not consumed. 
 
FSANZ notes that currently there are no agreed thresholds for any food allergen including 
parvalbumin. A threshold is the lowest dose of the allergen (parvalbumin) that can trigger an 
allergic reaction in fish-allergic individuals. However, the levels of parvalbumin that may be 
consumed in isinglass-fined beer are likely to be very low (estimated to be 0.001-0.005 µg/L 
for new protocol isinglass and ten fold higher at 0.01-0.05 µg/L for old protocol isinglass). 
 
The oral challenge studies indicate that isinglass prepared according to either the old or the 
new protocol did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the 21 fish-allergic individuals. The 
isinglass doses used in these studies and corresponding volumes of beer are as follows: 
 
Isinglass prepared 
according to: 
 
The cumulative oral challenge dose 
(no reactions observed): 
Equivalent volume of beer 
New manufacturing protocol  
 
50.5 mg isinglass 
(isinglass was given in increasing 
dose of 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 
mg in about 40 grams in mashed 
potato over 2 hours) 
50 L of bottle/can beer 
10 L of cask beer 
 
Old manufacturing protocol  
 
20 mg isinglass 20 L of bottle/can beer 
4 L of cask beer 
 
An average drinker of beer may consume about 1.5 L of beer within a single sitting, while a 
heavy drinker of beer may consume up to 3 L of beer within a single sitting. Clearly the dose 
of isinglass tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral challenge studies, as reported by 
the Applicant, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of beer that 
could be consumed by an individual within a single sitting.  
 
In light of the normal constrains on the volume that can be consumed by an individual within 
a few hours, FSANZ considers that potential exposure to parvalbumin through the 
consumption of beer fined with isinglass is likely to be extremely low.   
  
 54
2.7 Literature search 
 
Two literature searches were provided by the Applicant to demonstrate the rarity of reports 
on beer allergy. The searches, conducted in 2004 and in 2006, had numerous search words 
and covered 33 databases3. These extensive searches have failed to identify any publications 
that may be relevant to fish allergy due to consumption of beer. 
 
3. Wine-related data 
 
Information in this section is derived from documents provided to FSANZ by the Australian 
Wine Research Institute (AWRI) in April 2008; and from EFSA opinion (Request N
o EFSA-
Q-2006-154 – published in the EFSA Journal 2007, 533:1-8).   
 
3.1 Usage of isinglass in wine 
 
Information provided to FSANZ by the AWRI indicates that isinglass is used under GMP (as 
required in the Code under Standard 1.3.3) as a fining agent mainly in the production of white 
wine.  
 
The amount of isinglass used is determined for individual batches to avoid overuse, but 
typically falls between 10-25 mg isinglass/L of wine. Isinglass is removed by sedimentation 
followed by racking, which may include high performance centrifugation or filtration.  
 
3.2 Residual amounts of isinglass in wine 
 
Analytical data, commissioned by the AWRI, is provided for two commercial samples of 
isinglass-fined wine produced according to GMP (Hofman et al., 2002). The analytical 
method is based on partial purification of collagen from the test sample followed by analysis 
using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) technique. 
The wine samples had been fined with 0.42 and 4.4 mg isinglass/L wine, respectively. No 
collagen bands were detected in the wine samples. Using the same method, collagen residues 
could be recovered and detected in beer samples spiked with collagen at concentration of   
1.0 mg/L or more. The AWRI concludes that the concentration of residual isinglass in the 
commercial wine samples is likely to be less than 1 mg/L. This is the same level of residual 
isinglass that has been reported for bottled beer. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-
allergic consumers, was not detectable in beer samples fined using isinglass prepared 
according to the old or the new protocol. Although no data on parvalbumin detection was 
available for wine, there is no reason to expect the findings would be different from beer. 
Therefore, theoretical levels of parvalbumin, estimated to be 0.001-0.05 µg/L can be 
extrapolated.  
 
In a recently published study, 16 wines were tested for residues of isinglass (Weber et al 
2007). The wines were fined with four commercially available isinglass preparations at 50 or 
250 mL isinglass/100 L wine.

No residual isinglass could be detected in any of the wines when a competitive ELISA with 
LOD ≤ 5 µg/L was used. These findings further support results of undetectable isinglass in 
two samples of isinglass-fined Australian wines.  
 
3.3 Potential allergenicity of isinglass-fined wine 
 
An investigation of potential food allergens in fined wine was reported, including full details 
of the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and basophil activation analysis (Rolland 
et al., 2006). The scope of the study included wine fined with isinglass as well as egg and 
milk-derived processing aids. The data relevant to isinglass is outlined below. 
 
3.3.1 Literature search 
 
A search of the medical literature was conducted by the AWRI on PubMed using the terms ‘wine 
AND allergy’. The most commonly-reported adverse reactions among alcoholic beverage 
consumers appear to be associated with sulphite additives. However, the search was unable to 
identify any documented cases of adverse reactions specifically associated with isinglass.  
 
3.3.2 Double-blind placebo-controlled trial -Exposure to isinglass in fined wine 
 
The clinical study included ten fish-allergic subjects recruited from the Allergy Clinics, 
Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. The patients (five females and five males) were diagnosed by 
a clinical allergist with IgE-mediated food allergy, based on a history of anaphylaxis and 
corresponding demonstration of specific IgE to allergens of fish or by skin prick testing. The 
exception was one individual who had negative tests for IgE but a positive oral fish 
challenge. Clinical characteristics of the ten fish-allergic individuals are included in the 
published study (Rolland et al., 2006). 
 
Control subjects, with no IgE to any of the allergens including fish, were also included in the 
study.  
 
All subjects avoided antihistamine medications for three days, short-acting bronchodilator 
therapy for four hours, and long-acting bronchodilator therapy for twelve hours before each 
visit. Alcohol ingestion was avoided for at least three days before challenge, with subjects 
fasted for at least eight hours. 
 
Samples from 23 isinglass-fined wines were used in the study. Controls wines were clarified 
using other non-food protein-processing aids and/or filtration.  
 
Each subject consumed 100 mL (approximately one standard drink) over 10-15 minutes and 
completed a symptom questionnaire by using a visual analogue scale and repeated it at  
15 minute intervals for two hours after challenge. Over the next six days, subjects abstained 
from alcoholic beverages and recorded any possible late reactions in a diary.  
 
The study reported that one fish-allergic subject developed mild lip numbness, which 
resolved spontaneously, after ingestion of a control unfined wine. No subjects developed a 
typical IgE-mediated allergic reaction requiring medical treatment and no diary card 
abnormalities were noted during follow-up.  
  
 56
3.3.3 Basophil activation analysis 
 
An analysis using a modified basophil activation assay was described in the study by Rolland et 
al. (2006). The study reported that one isinglass-fined wine caused weak basophil activation for 
two out of ten fish-allergic subjects, but this same wine was also reported to have caused weak 
activation of basophils from a peanut-allergic subject (who is not allergic to fish). The two fish-
allergic subjects showed no clinical adverse reactions to another wine made using isinglass. 
One of the two fish-allergic subjects showed weak basophil activation to a wine made using 
non-grape tannin but this subject was not allergic to peanuts or tree nuts.   
 
4 Conclusion 
 
The Table to clause 6 in the Standard 1.3.3 (Processing Aids) requires that isinglass is used 
according to GMP. Adherence to GMP in the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent minimises 
the potential level of residual isinglass in the final product. Information provided by the 
Applicant indicates that residual level of isinglass in bottled beer and wine is about 1 mg/L   
 
Low but variable levels of parvalbumin may be present in commercial isinglass. Reducing the 
level of parvalbumin in isinglass even further is technically achievable by incorporating 
steps, including further washing, into the GMP for isinglass manufacturing. The Applicant 
states that the revised GMP is now widely adopted by the isinglass manufacturers which 
supply the Australian and New Zealand markets. Using currently available detection 
methods, parvalbumin was not detectable in isinglass-fined beer regardless of whether the 
isinglass was prepared according to the old or new protocol. 
 
Together, the GMP for the production of isinglass and the GMP for the use of isinglass in the 
fining of beer and wine, provide a high level of safety that counteracts uncertainties identified 
in this paper. The uncertainties relate to the newly developed analytical methodologies used 
in generating the data provided by the Applicant, the lack of information on the prevalence of 
fish allergy among the adult population in Australia and New Zealand, and the lack of an 
agreed threshold for parvalbumin.  
 
Therefore, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely 
to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.

Summary 
 
Isinglass is derived from fish swim bladders and is used as a clarifying agent in the brewing 
and wine industry. The rod-like helical structure and amphoteric nature (able to be both an 
acid and base) of the isinglass collagen are responsible for isinglass’s clarification properties. 
The yeast cells, polyphenolic and protein substances form complexes with the isinglass and 
settle to the bottom of the fermentation vessels, thereby assisting in clarifying the liquid.    
 
Residual isinglass in packaged beer and wine has been shown to be removed by the filtration 
process, whereas cask conditioned beer (which is unfiltered) would require sufficient 
sedimentation time to ensure all the isinglass has time to settle and form a stable mass at the 
bottom of the cask. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) needs to be followed when isinglass 
is utilised as a clarifying agent to ensure the minimum possible residue of isinglass in the 
finished product. 
 
The isinglass may potentially contain the protein parvalbumin, a known fish allergen. The 
level of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be minimised by establishing and adopting a 
manufacturing Code of Practice which is intended to reduce the level of parvalbumin.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
Isinglass is used extensively as a processing aid in the brewing and wine industry to improve 
the efficiency of the fining process (also called clarification) of beer and wine. Isinglass has 
been used for several centuries for this purpose. An estimated 200 tonnes of isinglass is used 
annually to clarify an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide. 
 
2. Production process of isinglass 
 
Isinglass is a collagen derived from dried swim bladders of specific tropical and subtropical 
fish. The traditional basic production process may vary between manufacturers, which can 
also depend on the source and species of the fish and does not seem to have a high level of 
standardisation (EFSA, 2007). The main steps involve blending swim bladders of specified 
fish to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply; granulation to reduce the size; washing in 
chilled water, sterilizing in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution and final rinsing with water. 
The sterilised granulated swim bladder is then further processed to different product forms 
such as powder, paste, ready-to-use paste and dry parchment or matted form. The three main 
forms of commercial isinglass are summarised below.  
 
2.1 Isinglass powder 
 
The sterilised hydrated isinglass is extruded using narrow apertures, which disrupts the 
collagen fibres.  It is then dried and milled into a powder of less than 1000 microns.   
  
 59
2.2 Isinglass paste  
 
The sterilised hydrated isinglass is macerated to less than 1000 microns paste by high shear 
mixing with the addition of sodium or potassium metabisulphite (as preservative). The paste 
is standardised to about 10% solids. 
 
2.3 Ready-to-use paste 
 
The isinglass paste can be further diluted then acidified with food grade acids to a pH of 2.0-3.0. 
The solids level is typically 0.3-1.5%. Sulphur dioxide is often used as a preservative. 
 
2.4 The new manufacturing protoc ol for isinglass production  
 
An industry-agreed GMP for isinglass has been adopted by the major suppliers of isinglass to 
ensure the presence of parvalbumin can be minimised. This GMP includes an additional 
washing stage using a phosphate buffer and successive washing steps with fresh water, the 
introduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall size 
does not exceed 25 mm and the exclusion of certain fish species. Some fish species appear to 
have low levels of parvalbumin and therefore, have been specifically included in the new 
GMP (EFSA, 2007). 
 
3. Physico-chemical characteristics and technological function of isinglass 
 
3.1 Functions and characteristics 
 
A fining agent such as isinglass is added to beer and wine to reduce or remove the presence 
of one or more undesirable components in order to achieve clarity and potentially improve 
sensory appeal, flavour and physical stability in the final product (Morris and Main, 1995). 
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen (95%) along with small amounts of 
gelatine, its denaturation product (Hickman et al., 2000; EFSA, 2007). The isinglass collagen 
exists as a rod-like triple helical molecule, amphoteric in nature (able to be both an acid and 
base) and is thermally labile, denaturing at about 29
oC to form the random coils of gelatine 
(Hickman et al., 2000). However, the fish allergen, parvalbumins, present mainly in fish 
muscles and at low levels in fish bladders, seems to be heat stable after heating for three 
hours at 90oC (Arif et al., 2007). The parvalbumin has a pI (isoelectric point) of around  
3.9-5.5 (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000). 
 
Isinglass collagen has a molecular weigh of 800-1300 kDa and contains hydroxyproline in its 
structure, which is important to its functionality (EFSA, 2007). The rod-like structural 
integrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for efficient clarification 
(Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the fining activity is based 
upon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically attract yeast cells with 
negatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged polyphenolic and protein 
components. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the bottom of the container. In 
the sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in firm sediment that is resistant to 
disturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  
  
 60
3.2 Clarifying process procedure in the brewing industry 
 
In the brewing process, after fermentation, the beer is cooled to around freezing, which 
encourages settling of the yeast and causes proteins to coagulate and settle out with the yeast. 
Similar to the wine production process, it is at this stage that isinglass powder dissolved in 
dilute solutions of food grade acids is added to the fermented beer to aid in the clarifying 
process. The pH of beer is typically between 3.9 and 4.6 (Siebert and Lynn, 2005). At this 
pH, isinglass is positively charged (iso-electric point of isinglass is around 5.5) and thus 
attracting and aggregating negatively charged particles. However, if the pH of the beer is 
below 3.5, the fining activity is severely inhibited (Ward, 2008).    
 
For optimum fining performance, beer must be fined at the coldest point in the process. The 
reason is that if the chill haze (from protein precipitation) is present prior to isinglass 
addition, it is then readily removed by fining. This is especially important for cask beer, since 
there are no effective alternatives to the use of isinglass in producing bright unfiltered beer 
(Ward 2008).   
 
Information provided by the Applicant suggests that the brewing industry typically uses 
isinglass at a low level of between 10-15 mg/L but this level can potentially go as high as    
60 mg/L in some brews. The sediment formed by the collagen and yeast complex is removed 
by filtration and/or the centrifugation processes, resulting in very low residual levels of 
isinglass in the final product. Cask conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or 
centrifugation and relies on gravity settling.  
 
3.3 Clarification function of isingl ass in wine production process  
 
The flowchart in Figure 1 below shows generalised processing steps of white wine. The red 
wine process is expected to be similar. The fining step, where isinglass is usually added, 
occurs after alcohol fermentation has been completed and before filtration. The main purpose 
is to aggregate polymeric carbohydrates, proteins and polyphenols to form larger aggregates 
that sink to the bottom. Such aggregation improves the filtering efficiency as a consequence 
by initially clarifying the wine (Wucherpfenning, 2003).  
 
Three different types of filters are commonly used in wine filtration; precoat filter, sheet filter 
and membrane filter, which are membranes of different pore size that can be used to remove 
particles down to the molecular level from the wine.   
 
After the fining and filtration process, the wine is normally sufficiently clear and has a pH 
value ranged from 2.8-4.0, depending on the types of wine (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). 
Some wines are subjected to further cold stabilisation before they are ready for development 
to maturity and bottled. 
 
Isinglass is claimed to be a preferred clarification agent compared to egg or casein, because 
of its mild effect on flavour. Different batches of wine require different amounts of isinglass, 
as determined by laboratory tests. In Australia, isinglass is typically added at between 
approximately 20-50 mg/L in the production of wine (Wine Australia, 2008), in New 
Zealand, use in wine is typically about 6-10 mg/L (New Zealand Winegrowers, 2008) and use 
in white wine in France is typically between 10-25 mg/L (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). In 
both Australia and New Zealand isinglass is considered as the best and most expensive 
clarifying agent and is not likely to be used in excess if usage is not warranted.

3.3 Good Manufacturing practice for usage of Isinglass  
  
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a requirement in regulating the maximum amount of 
the isinglass which may be present in a food. The relevant GMP criteria for isinglass are: 
 
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limited to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect;  
 
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of f ood as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and 
 
(c) the material is prepar ed and handled in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
4. Allergenic residue issues 
 
4.1 Parvalbumin as the allergen 
 
Parvalbumin has been identified as a fish allergen, based mainly on studies of three species of 
fish: Atlantic salmon, carp and Japanese horse mackerel.

Further immuno-blotting analyses led to the conclusion that parvalbumin is the major fish 
albumin independent of fish species (Hamada et al., 2001). Parvalbumin is generally 
associated with skeletal muscle tissue, even though the presence of parvalbumin has 
previously been detected in swim bladders of fish not used for isinglass manufacture (Feher 
et al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).   
 
4.2 Reported studies on residues of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
It was reported that the filtration process removed all isinglass residues in filtered beer during 
the process, tested using a HPLC method that can detect amino acids concentration as low as 
3.9 x 10-13 mg/L. However, the study showed that in order for the cask beer to be free of 
isinglass, sufficient time is required for the sediment to settle properly before dispensing 
(Chlup et al., 2006). 
 
A recent study investigated the manufacturing processes on the removal of a range of fining 
agents in four German wines. The wines were dosed with isinglass at 10-50 mg/L and other 
fining agents at five times their normal dosage levels. ELISA assays were used as the 
analytical method and detected no isinglass or fish gelatine in wine, except lysozyme and 
dried egg white, which are soluble in wine. It demonstrated that fining agents used for wine 
are removed during the manufacturing process or those that are insoluble are removed by 
filtration (Weber et al., 2007).   
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Isinglass derived from fish swim bladders used as a clarifying agent in the brewing and wine 
industry may contain parvalbumin. The level of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be 
minimised by following a GMP that is specifically designed for this purpose. 
 
Residual isinglass has been shown to be removed by the filtration/settling process in wine, in 
beer that is filtered; and in cask conditioned beer (that is unfiltered) if sufficient 
sedimentation time is received. It is very likely that parvalbumin with its pI at around 3.9-5.5, 
could precipitate out in wine and beer, which also has pH around 4 and lower. The 
precipitated parvalbumin would then settle with the sediment with isinglass-protein 
complexes or be filtered out by the filtration processes.

COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2007/68/EC
of 27 November 2007
amending Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as
regards certain food ingredients
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the
approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to
the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (
1), and
in particular third subparagraph of Article 6(11) and Article 21
thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC establishes a list of
food ingredients which must be indicated on the label of
foodstuffs as they are likely to cause adverse reactions in
susceptible individuals.
(2) Directive 2000/13/EC provides for the possibility of
excluding from the labelling requirement ingredients or
substances derived from ingredients listed in Annex IIIa
for which it has been scientifically established that they
are not likely, under specific circumstances, to trigger
adverse reactions.
(3) Commission Directive 2005/26/EC (2) establishes the list
of food ingredients or substances provisionally excluded
from the labelling requirement until the 25 November
2007.
(4) A number of applications for permanent exemption from
the labelling requirement have been submitted to the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Those appli-
cations concern substances for which provisional
exemptions were granted by Directive 2005/26/EC. On
the basis of the EFSA opinions and other available infor-
mation, it can be concluded that certain ingredients or
substances derived from those ingredients listed in Annex
IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC are not likely, under specific
circumstances, to cause adverse reactions in susceptible
individuals.
(5) Those ingredients or substances derived from those
ingredients should therefore be permanently excluded
from Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC.
(6) Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended
accordingly.
(7) Directive 2005/26/EC should be repealed on
26 November 2007 in view of the deadline set by
Article 6(11), second subparagraph of Directive
2000/13/EC.
(8) In order to avoid disruption of the market, it is necessary
for this Directive to apply from the 26 November 2007.
(9) It was expected that this Directive could be adopted and
published well in advance of the date of 26 November
2007 in order to give time to the industry to adapt to
the new rules. Since this has not been possible in
practice, temporary measures appear therefore necessary
to facilitate the application of the new rules. Indeed
changes in labelling rules will affect industry, mainly
small and medium enterprises, which need an adaptation
period to smooth the transition towards new labelling
requirements.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in
accordance with the opinion of the Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies 
on a request from the Commission related to a notification from Brewers of 
Europe and BFBi on isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing  
pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 11 of Directive 2000/13/EC  - for permanent 
exemption from labelling 
 
 
(Request Nº EFSA-Q-2006-312) 
 
(Adopted on 6 July 2007) 
 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Beer production normally incl udes fining of the beer. Fining  is achieved by mixing fining 
agents with the beer duri ng production, thereafter comple xed materials are removed by 
sedimentation, filtration, or both. Commonly used fining agents include a collagen preparation 
from fish swim bladders, isinglass. Fish alle rgy has been reported to affect 0.2%-2.2% of the 
population in European countries. Fi sh can cause severe reactions in allergic individuals and it 
is appropriate to assess allergen levels in beer clarified with isinglass. 
                                                                                                                                                                              
Allergens of concern in isinglass are primaril y residual amounts of the major fish allergen 
parvalbumin, and collagen/gelatine which constitu te the major component (95%) of isinglass. 
An industry-agreed Code of Good Manufactur ing Practice (GMP) for isinglass has been 
adopted by the applicant to lower the content of parvalbumin in the product. This substantially 
reduced the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass. A history of safe use is claimed. However, there 
may have been a significant under-reporting of react ions against isinglass in beer, because it is 
uncertain whether beer drinkers and health pr ofessionals have been aware of the possible 
presence of fish protein in beer. Analytical data indicate a re sidue level of isinglass in beer up 
to 5 mg/L. Parvalbumin levels in isinglass ranged from 0.2 mg/Kg to 0.7 mg/Kg. The estimated 
maximum concentration of parvalbumin in beer is 0.005 μg/L. However, there is considerable 
uncertainty about the accuracy of the assa ys. Two new double-blind placebo-controlled food 
challenge studies with isingla ss are reported, in which none of  21 fish allergic patients 
experienced any adverse effects.  
 
On the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals 
under the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant.

BACKGROUND  
 
In November 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted  Directive 2003/89/EC 1 
amending Directive 2000/13/EC, as regards indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. 
  
Annex IIIa of the Directive specif ies a list of food ingredients or substances that are known to 
trigger allergic reactions or intolerances in sensitive individuals for which no labelling 
exemptions are allowed. Whenever the listed ingr edients/substances or their derivatives are 
used in the production of foodstuffs, they must be labelled. 
 
Article 1, paragraph 11, subparagraph 2 of the Di rective establishes a procedure allowing for 
temporary labelling exemption of derivatives fr om ingredients listed in Annex IIIa for which it 
has been scientifically established that it is not  possible for them to cause adverse reactions. In 
accordance with this provision, submissions of re quest for temporary labelling exemption were 
notified to the Commission before 25 August 2004. The Commission, after consultation with 
the European Food Safety Authorit y, adopted a list (Directive 2005/26/EC
2) of those 
ingredients which are temporarily excluded fr om Annex IIIa until 25 November 2007, pending 
the final results of the notified studies.  
 
Consequently, applicants who submitted a dossier in 2004 on the basis of subparagraph 2, 
resulting in the inclusion of a product in the list of Direc tive 2005/26/EC, and who are seeking 
exclusion of that product from Annex IIIa beyond 25 November 2007, will have to submit a 
request enclosing the final results of the notified scientific studies. Therefore in the context of 
the permanent labelling exemption procedure, th e European Food Safety Authority is asked to 
provide scientific opinions on the submissi ons in accordance with the present terms of 
reference. 
 
 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
In accordance with Article 29 (1) (a) of Regulation (EC) N° 178/2002, the European 
Commission requests the European  Food Safety Authority to evaluate the scientific data 
submitted by the Brewers of Europe and BFBi (Brewing Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers 
Association) in the framework of the procedur e laid down for temporary labelling exemptions 
in Article 6, paragraph 11 of Di rective 2000/13/EC. On the basis of that evaluation, EFSA is 
requested to issue an opinion on the informati on provided, and particul arly to consider the 
likelihood of adverse reactions triggered in susc eptible individuals by th e consumption of the 
following ingredients/substances used under the conditions specified by the applicant: isinglass. 
 
 
ASSESSMENT  
 
The magnitude of the adult fish-allergic popul ation is uncertain. A Danish population-based 
study with double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) verification of allergy

indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. OJ L 308. 25.11.2003, p. 15. 
2 Commission Directive 2005/26/EC of 21 March 2005 establishing a list of food ingredients or substances 
provisionally excluded from Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.

(Osterballe et al., 2005), found 0.2% of the adult population to  be allergic to codfish. The total 
number of fish-allergic individuals may be somewhat higher, because some fish-allergic 
individuals do not react to codfish. A population-based Amer ican study (telephone survey) 
(Sicherer et al., 2004) gave numbers in the same range , whereas in a European questionnaire-
based study (Woods et al., 2001) 2.2% reported (self-perceived) fish allergy or intolerance. 
 
Taking into account the numerous and well documented reports of allergic individuals reacting 
to fish (NDA, 2004a), it is appropriate for the Panel to assess th e likelihood of adverse 
reactions in allerg ic individuals consuming products wher e the fish-derived product isinglass 
has been used during the manufacturing process. 
 
A dossier submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BFBi) 
and The Brewers of Europe to the European Commission pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 11 of 
Directive 2000/13/EC as amended by Dire ctive 2000/89/EC on 13 May 2004 for temporary 
exemption from labelling was the basis for an earlier assessment of isinglass by the NDA panel 
(NDA, 2004b).  
 
The present opinion is based on an updated dossi er from the same organization, with an 
application for permanent exemption from labe lling. The updated dossier  contains additional 
information and data mainly with regard to  improvement of the manufacturing process, 
analytical studies on isinglass in beer and on the amount of parvalbumin in isinglass, and 
clinical studies of allergenicity. 
 
1. Manufacturing process  
 
Isinglass is a form of collagen derived from  dried swim bladders of  certain tropical and 
subtropical fish. The production process vari es, according to the applicant, between 
manufacturers. It consists of blending of swim bladders from di fferent fish to meet quality, 
functionality, cost and supply criteria. Then various step s follow including granulation, 
washing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen peroxide and further washing.  
 
Isinglass powder, paste and “ready-to-use” liqui ds are tested empirically for functionality 
(clarification efficiency) by the isinglass indust ry to ensure consiste nt performance of the 
product. The customers purchase according to certain specifications, including hygienic 
(bacteria, heavy metals) and functionality (pro tein) parameters. The Panel notes that the 
traditional manufacturing process does not have a high level of standardization, which may 
affect possible residual levels of the majo r fish allergen, parvalbumin. However, in 
consideration of results from an alytical studies (see below), an  industry-agreed Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice (G MP) for isinglass has been adop ted by the applicants. To reduce 
parvalbumin content in isinglass, this GMP C ode includes an additiona l washing stage using 
phosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim 
bladder wall particle size does not exceed 25 mm , and the exclusion of some previously used 
fish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. 
 
2. Characterisation of the product and its use  
 
2.1 Characterisation of isinglass  
 
It is stated that the major component of isingl ass (95%) is Type I colla gen together with its 
denaturation product, gelatine (Hickman et al ., 2000; Leach and Barrett, 1967; Moir et al. ,  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 4 of 10 
1984). Isinglass collagen has a molecular wei ght of 800-1300 kDa. Key to the structure, 
functionality and quantification of  isinglass collagen is the presence of hydroxyproline, which 
is rare in other proteins but characteristic of collagen (regar ding its use for quantification of 
isinglass, see below). The profile  of amino acids varies dependi ng on the fish species, and the 
proportion of hydroxyproline reportedly depends on activity and environm ental temperature. 
Isinglass also contains elastin at levels up to 2.5% dry weight . Like collagen, elastin contains 
hydroxyproline.  
 
2.2 Conditions of use  
 
Isinglass is used to remove particles from beer . Isinglass is added to beer in soluble form, 
typically after fermentation an d cooling of the beer, at 15  mg/L (range 10-60 mg/L) for 
brewery-conditioned beers and around 50 mg/L for cask-conditioned beers. Isinglass is 
thereafter removed by sedimentation fo llowed by filtration (sometimes high-speed 
centrifugation can replace filtration). Isinglass redu ces the particle load that goes to the filters, 
and also removes some small particles that would pass through the filters.  
 
Cask-conditioned beer is a traditio nal style of beer in England, in which the yeast remains in 
the cask. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer  before filling or directly into the cask. The 
action of isinglass, it is state d, takes place within the first 3 to 4 hours and results in compact 
sediment at the base of the cask. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the sediment, 
and must be essentially free of suspended part icles. Cask-conditioned beer accounted for 7.5% 
of beer produced in the UK in 2002.  
 
2.3 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer, and exposure levels 
 
2.3.1 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer 
 
Data submitted for temporary exemption (NDA 2004b)  indicated that leve ls of isinglass in 
typical commercial beers ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/L, based on a pr otein precipitation and 
separation method. Another method was based on the separation by affinity chromatography 
using rabbit anti-isinglass antibodies, followed by quantification of isin glass by measuring the 
amount of hydroxyproline using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The method 
employing hydroxyproline as a marker for collagen has been further developed, and the limit of 
detection (LOD) is reported to correspond to 0.17 mg/L on an isinglass dry weight basis. 
 
Results indicate that for many bottle and can beers, residual levels of isinglass are below the 
LOD. The highest concentrations of isinglass detected in these types of beer did not exceed 1 
mg/L. For large containers (kegs and casks), isi nglass concentrations were higher. Residues in 
kegs were generally below 1 mg/L, but occasio nal samples contained up to 3 mg/L. For cask-
conditioned beers, the highest concentrations of isinglass measured did not exceed 5 mg/L. 
Even in cloudy beer, i.e. beer  drawn from just above the se dimented material, in which 
isinglass concentrations were slightly higher th an in the bulk, isinglass concentrations did not 
exceed 5 mg/L. Thus, there was little evidence of a concentration gradient of residues within 
the beer in either casks or kegs. 
 
2.3.2 Exposure levels 
  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 5 of 10 
According to the applicant, annually an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide are 
treated with isinglass, approximately 30 milli on hectolitres of that being in Europe. An 
estimated 200 tonnes of isinglass are used annually worldwide to clarify beer. 
 
With 5 mg/L isinglass and a serving of 350 mL clarified beer, the isinglass intake per serving of 
clarified beer would be 1.75 mg. A consumer drinking 1 litre of beer would have an intake of 5 
mg. The Panel notes that  the new analytical methodology has led to the ten-fold increased 
exposure estimate for isinglass over that in the previous application (NDA, 2004b).  
 
Parvalbumin exposure must be calculated from isinglass residue data, because the applicant 
was unable to measure parvalbumin directly in beer (see below). According to the applicant’s 
calculations, the maximum concentration of pa rvalbumin in beer could range from 0.001 μg/L 
(bottle and can beer) to 0.005 μg/L (cask conditioned beer) ba sed on measurement data with 
the new GMP isinglass. With the use of traditio nal commercial isinglass the estimate would be 
about ten-fold higher. Taking measurement un certainties into account and making certain 
assumptions, e.g. that parvalbumin is not eluted from the isinglass into  the beer, the highest 
parvalbumin concentration (new GMP code) derived for cask beer is 0.02 µg/L according to the 
applicant’s estimates. These doses are lower than doses reported to trigger adverse reactions in 
double blind placebo controlled food challenge studies (Taylor et al., 2002), assuming that the 
parvalbumin content of fish muscle is 4000 µg/g or less (Vornanen et al., 1999). However, the 
Panel notes the uncertainties about the accuracy of the measurements and assumptions 
regarding the parvalbumin concentration in beer, as well as the uncertainty with regard to the 
lowest dose of parvalbumin that can trigger an allergic reaction.  
 
3. Evidence of non-allergenicity 
 
3.1 History of non-allergenicity of the product  
 
3.1.1 Literature search strategy  
 
The literature search strategy used to provide historical evidence fo r safety of isinglass used in 
the process of brewing is well de scribed in the application, both in terms of databases searched 
and search terms used.  
 
3.1.2 Historical evidence of safe use  
 
The applicant states that isinglass has been used  as a fining agent for at least two centuries. 
Traditionally, all beer in the UK was fined with isinglass. Addi tionally, isinglass has 
historically been used as an ingredient in f oods and as a setting agent for jellies. Finally, the 
swim bladders themselves are consumed as a food delicacy. In the lit erature search, three 
papers were identified that me ntioned isinglass or fish maws. However, no report s of allergic 
responses to beer, isinglass or fish maws in fish sensitive individuals were found. 
 
The Panel notes that it is uncer tain whether allergy to fish ha s been considered by patients 
experiencing, or by doctors inve stigating, reactions to beer. Mo st people, including medical 
personnel, are likely to be unaware that subs tances derived from fish are used during 
production of beer. Thus, there may have been under-reporting of reactions caused by isinglass 
in beer.

 Page 6 of 10 
The Panel further notes that according to the scien tific literature, adverse reactions in part with 
allergy-like symptoms, do not appear to be infrequent following alcoholic beverage 
consumption. In some surveys of asthmatics,  over 40% have reported the triggering of 
symptoms and 30-35% reported worsening of their asthma. Although wine was the most 
frequently reported trigger of these adverse reactions (Vally and Thompson, 2003), reactions to 
beer also occur often without etiological investigations being undertaken.  
 
3.2 Preclinical studies on allergenicity  
 
Allergic reactions to isinglass as fining agent in  beer could be due to residual amounts of the 
major fish allergen parvalbumin, or the collagen and gelatine th at are major constituents of 
isinglass. 
 
3.2.1 Residual amounts of parvalbumin  
 
The major fish allergen is parvalbumin (NDA , 2004a). The swim bladders of the primitive 
species of fish used for isingl ass production have certain anatomical differences from the swim 
bladders of other fish, and are not generally asso ciated with skeletal muscle tissue. However, 
there is a smooth muscle layer in the swim bl adder wall, and the presence of parvalbumin has 
previously been demonstrated in swim bladders  of fish not used fo r isinglass manufacture 
(Feher et al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).  
 
SDS-PAGE analysis of fish used for isingl ass production showed a band at 12 kDa which is 
characteristic of parvalbumin, whereas a si milar band was not displayed by swim bladder 
extracts. With immunoblotting (polyclonal ra bbit anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum) however, 
traces of parvalbumin were detected in one out of six swim bladder samples.  
 
Homology studies of 18 fish parvalbumins fro m 10 species, based on publicly available 
sequences are reported (NCBI, 200 7). A given fish species cont ains usually 2-5 different 
parvalbumins. Fish species used for isinglass production were not included in the homology 
studies. Two Atlantic and one Baltic cod pa rvalbumins were 63% to 74% identical, and 
parvalbumins from the other fish were from 53% to 92% identical to the three codfish 
parvalbumins. Referring to the literature (Aalberse, 2000), the applicants conclude that high 
levels of sequence identity were observed th at indicate a high likelihood of antibody cross-
reactivity.  
 
ELISA tests based on carp and cod parvalbumins were developed. The anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA was capable of detecting 0.05 µg/mL carp 
parvalbumin in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extract (1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis), 
using the amount of recombinant carp parvalbu min needed to obtain 20% inhibition as the 
detection limit. Strong matrix effects were obs erved when 10% fish gelatine extract was used 
instead of PBS. Comparing different fish speci es, the protein concentration needed to obtain 
50% inhibition was 1.8 µg/mL for carp, 0.4 µg/mL for catfish, 2.8 µg/mL for cod and 10 
µg/mL for tuna, equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin. Fish used for isinglass 
production was not available for testing. The Pane l notes the lack of accuracy of the carp 
parvalbumin-based ELISA, possibly due to species differences, matrix effects or a combination 
thereof. 
 
 
The anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibody-ba sed sandwich ELISA is reported to have a 
limit of detection of 0.20 µg/g cod parvalbumin in PBS. Muscle extracts from the fish species  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 7 of 10 
used for isinglass production did not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, 
although there was evidence for the presence of parvalbumin based on SDS-PAGE and 
immunoblotting with an antibody used in the ELIS A. However, eleven isinglass preparations 
tested gave positive results (see below). The Panel notes that there are uncertainties with regard 
to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of 
parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass. 
 
Parvalbumin was detected in single-species isingl ass preparations from a range of fish species, 
obtained from six different supplie rs. Certain fish species appear ed to have more parvalbumin 
than others. Accordingly it was decided that t hose species with high levels of parvalbumin 
which were not otherwise essential in commer cial blends for func tional reasons would no 
longer be used, and a common list of 6 fish speci es was agreed by isinglass manufacturers and 
incorporated into a new GMP code. Further st udies suggested that washing with phosphate 
buffer could reduce residual parvalbumin in isingl ass approximately 4-fold over levels in the 
original raw material, and such washing was also  incorporated into the new GMP code. Levels 
of residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglas s blends on the market (8 products from 3 
manufacturers) were found to be in the range of 1-35 mg/Kg, but  mostly less than 10 mg/Kg. 
Experience with the new GMP code is limited, but isinglass parvalbumin levels are expected by 
the applicant to be less than 1 mg/Kg, and valu es in 9 samples for which data are provided 
ranged from undetectable to 0.7 mg/Kg, most being less than 0.3 mg/Kg (codfish ELISA).  
 
Studies of beer from a 212.700 L tank, as well as theoretical considerations on parvalbumin 
solubility, suggested that parv albumin was significantly concentr ated in the beer sediment, 
rather than partitioning into the bulk of th e beer. In studies on freeze-dried beers employing 
both ELISA assays, with a detection limit of about 9 µg parvalbumin/L of beer, no parvalbumin 
was detected.  
 
3.2.2 Pepsin digestion 
 
The applicant reports pepsin digestion experime nts on isinglass. The Pa nel notes that this 
method is unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass. 
 
3.2.3 Allergenicity of collagen and gelatine from fish – IgE binding studies 
 
 
Gelatine is denatured collagen. A number of scientific papers re port that serum IgE from some 
fish allergic individuals binds to fish collagen and gelatine. However, the presence of IgE-
binding to gelatine and collagen does not mean that clinical reactivity is present (see below).   
 
3.3 Clinical studies on allergenicity 
 
3.3.1 Skin testing  
  
Protocols were developed for skin testing with ex tracts of fish muscle and swim bladders from 
a range of species of fish used for commercial isinglass manufacture. Of eight Danish fish 
allergic patients tested, 8/8 reacted to the fish muscle, and 7/8 reacted to the swim bladder. This 
indicates that fish allergic individuals in Wester n Europe have the potential to react to the fish 
species and the starting material from which isi nglass is produced. No skin prick testing with 
commercial isinglass is reported. 
 
3.3.2 Double blind placebo cont rolled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies with isinglass   
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 8 of 10 
 
According to the applicant, the isinglass us ed for DBPCFC was prepared from a typical 
commercial blend of the agreed six fish species using the new GMP protocols. The 
parvalbumin content, as determined with the ELISA, was 1.0 μg/g carp parvalbumin 
equivalents, and 0.695 μg/g cod parvalbumin equivalents. Inclusion criteria were subjects age 3 
to 70 years in good health, a convincing clinical hi story of a Type I allergic reaction when fish 
was consumed, a positive skin pric k test (as large or larger than  the positive control histamine 
skin prick test) to one or more species of fi sh with a commercial ex tract, and a specific IgE 
score to fish greater than 0.35 kU A/L; both tests had to be perfor med no more than 6 months 
previously. Isinglass was given with mashed pot atoes at cumulative doses of 50.5 mg over two 
hours (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg ), corresponding to about 10 litres of cask conditioned beer 
or 50 litres of brewery conditioned beer. None of  fifteen patients subjected to this challenge 
protocol in Denmark and Switzerland reacted to the challenges. 
 
In a study in France employing a different protoc ol, a cumulative dose of 20 mg isinglass was 
given corresponding to the e quivalent of four litres of beer. Inclusion criteria  were “allergic 
patients” age 14 to 18 years, but are not further specified in the dossier. None out of six patients 
challenged (2/6 skin test positive to fish) had a reaction.  
 
The Panel notes that the DBPCFC were performed in food matrices in which isinglass is not 
usually consumed. Alcohol is considered to lo wer the dose that may trigger a food allergic 
reaction in susceptible individuals (Sicherer, 2000). 
 
3.3.3 Food challenge studies with fish gelatine  
 
There are no reports of clinical reactions to fish gelatine in relation to food intake, and 
DBPCFC studies have so far been negative, except for one individual reacting to 7.6 g of 
gelatine (NDA, 2004 a and b). Food challenges with gelatine or collagen were not performed in 
the various studies reporting fi sh collagen and gelatine IgE bi nding, except for the two studies 
referred below.  
 
In a DBPCFC study by a Danish group (Hansen et al ., 2004), no adverse reactions were 
observed when 30 codfish allergic patients were  given a cumulative dose of 3.6 g of fish 
gelatine derived from codfish skin. A mild r eaction confirmed in a repeated challenge was 
experienced by one patient when given a cumulative dose of 7.6 g. There was no reaction to the 
next higher dose.  
 
In a French single-blind study (André et al ., 2003) of 100 children and adults with IgE 
reactivity to various species of fish, fish (tuna) skin-derived collagen was used. It was found 
that 3 out of 100 sera showed IgE binding to tuna  skin-derived fish ge latine. A food challenge 
test using 5 g of tuna gelatine was negative in these three subjects.  
 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
On the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals 
under the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_16.pdf,"INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Prevalence
 
     Allergy to fish is a common cause of IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. Although 
the exact prevalence of fish-allergic subjects is not firmly established clinically, fish is 
widely accepted as one of the most common allergenic foods (Bousquet et al., 1998).  
Fish allergy is expected to be more common in geographic areas where fish is an 
important dietary component although other factors beyond dietary preferences appear to 
be involved in determination of the sensitization to both food and airborne allergens 
(Gislason et al., 1999).  Because of certain nutritional benefits particularly the levels of 
omega-3 fatty acids, dietary advice often emphasizes the increased consumption of fish.  
The prevalence of adverse reactions to fish is expected to increase worldwide as 
consumers increase their consumption of fish and also because of technological advances 
in fish processing which encourage fish consumption in areas further from the seaside 
(O’Neil and Lehrer, 1995).     
 
     Certainly, fish consumption is reasonably high in the European Union and fish allergy 
is undeniably of considerable clinical importance.  Fish allergy is often identified as one 
of the most common allergenic foods in studies involving pediatric allergy patients 
(Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; Crespo et al., 1992; Sicherer 
et al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  Fish is also an important cause 
of food allergy in adults (Helbling et al., 1999; Hansen and Bindslev-Jensen, 1992; 
Hansen et al., 1997).  In the general population, fish was responsible for about 10% of all 
cases of food anaphylaxis in a case series reported in France by Moneret-Vautrin and 
Kanny (1995).  In an investigation of anaphylaxis episodes in Italy, fish was the most 
common cause of food-related anaphylaxis accounting for 30% of all cases (Novembre et 
al., 1998).      
     A recent survey in the United States indicated that the prevalence of fish allergy in the 
population was 0.4% (Sicherer et al., 2004).  Although this estimate was not confirmed 
by clinical studies, the estimate is probably reasonable given the immediate and often 
clinically noteworthy presentation of allergic reactions to fish.  Sensitization to fish was 
reported in 0.2% of the populations of both Iceland and Sweden (Gislason et al., 1999), 
although challenges were not done in this study either to confirm the existence of fish 
allergy.  The prevalence of sensitization to fish in Sweden had previously been estimated 
at 0.3% (Björnsson et al., 1996).  These prevalence estimates are in reasonable agreement 
with one another suggesting that the true prevalence of fish allergy in the general 
population is likely to be 0.2-0.4%. 
 
Clinical Manifestations
 
     Symptoms of fish allergy are similar to other IgE-mediated food allergies (Lopata and 
Jeebhay, 2001).  Symptoms usually appear immediately (minutes to an hour) following 
exposure and range from mild to life-threatening.  In clinical challenge trials, cutaneous, 
gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms have been provoked by fish (Helbling et al., 
1999; Sicherer et al., 2000). 
 
     Severe, life-threatening allergic reactions have certainly been triggered by fish on 
occasion.  In a study of 60 patients who presented with severe, near-fatal reactions, fish 
were identified as the cause of 13% of the cases (Andre et al., 1994).  In another study of 
14 patients with histories of severe allergic reactions to food, four reactions were caused 
by fish intake (Eigenmann and Calza, 2000).  Several fatalities in the USA have been 
attributed to inadvertent ingestion of fish by fish-allergic individuals (Yunginger et al., 
1988; Bock et al., 2001).  In the U.K., three fatalities are attributed to “seafood” which 
could be fish (Pumphrey, 2000). 
 
Natural History of Fish Allergy
 
     Clearly, fish allergy can have its onset in young children as documented by challenge 
trials in pediatric patients (Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; 
Crespo et al., 1992; Sicherer et al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  
While young children often become tolerant of certain allergenic foods, such as milk and 
egg, over time, fish allergy is not known to be outgrown. 
 
Clinical Cross-Reactivity
 
     A large number of different fish species have been implicated in allergic reactions to 
fish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Typically, fish-allergic individuals are advised to avoid 
ingestion of all species of fish (Helbling et al., 1999).  The Codex Alimentarius 
Commission has recommended the labeling of fish and products thereof because of the 
notion that fish-allergic individuals are allergic to all species of fish and may also be 
allergic to ingredients derived from fish.  However, while this advice is likely prudent, it 
is not consistent with clinical challenge trials.  In clinical challenge trials conducted in 
 2several clinical centers, fish-allergic patients were sometimes reactive to all fish species 
but on other occasions were able to tolerate certain species while reacting to others 
(Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Helbling et al., 1999).  In many studies, serological 
cross-reactivity among various fish species is widespread (examples see:  Hansen et al., 
1997; Sten et al., 2004; Helbling et al., 1999; De Martino et al., 1993). 
 
Fish Allergens: Parvalbumin as the Major Allergen 
 
     The major allergen in codfish, namely Gad c 1, is a muscle protein that is a member of 
the parvalbumin family (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  The muscles of all fishes contain 
parvalbumins that are homologous, acidic proteins with molecular weights in the range of 
11-12,000 Da that control the flow of Ca2+ in and out of cells.    Gad c 1 is a very stable 
molecule, resistant to extremes in pH, temperature or random folding of the molecule 
when exposed to dissociating agents (Aas and Elsayed, 1975).  All cod-allergic patients 
react to Gad c 1 (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  Parvalbumin is found as the major allergen in 
both Baltic cod (Gad c 1; Elsayed and Aas, 1971) and Atlantic cod (Gad m 1; Das Dores 
et al., 2002a).  The allergens from other fish species are also parvalbumins including 
salmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel (Tra j 1), several species of tuna including bigeye tuna 
(Thu o 1), bluefin tuna, yellowfina tuna and albacore tuna, three species of mackerel (Sco 
j 1, Sco a 1, Sco s 1), pollack (The c 1), and carp (Cyp c 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 
1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; 
Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999).  Evidence indicates that parvalbumin is present 
in numerous other species of fish even if the protein has not been isolated and 
documented as the major allergen in these species.  Parvalbumin is also the major 
allergen in frog legs and appears to be responsible for cross-reactions between fish and 
frog (Hilger et al., 2004).  Taken together, this research suggests that parvalbumins are 
major pan-allergens in fish and suggests a basis for the cross-reactivity of fish-allergic 
individuals to many, if not all, species of fish.   
 
    Curiously, fish-allergic individuals do not always appear to react on challenge to all 
species of fish.  Although unexplained, several reasons could exist for this lack of clinical 
reactivity.  Some species of fish may have very low levels of parvalbumin.  Chen et al. 
(2006) noted that tuna had low levels of parvalbumin as detectable with an anti-frog 
parvalbumin antibody that was able to detect parvalbumin in other fish species.  
Similarly, fish-allergic patients displayed little or no binding to parvalbumins or proteins 
in that molecular weight range in previous studies with tuna (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 
1998; James et al., 1997; Lim et al., 2005).  Tuna are among the more commonly 
tolerated fish by individuals with fish allergy (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Torres 
Borrego et al., 2003).  Secondly, parvalbumin is now known to have conformational 
epitopes (Untersmayr et al., 2006).  Therefore, slight differences in the three-dimensional 
structure of parvalbumin could affect individual patient reactivity.  Also, heat processing 
in particular could affect these conformational epitopes.  Severe heat processing such as 
the canning of tuna appears to affect allergenicity (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992).  
Finally, the dark muscles of sardine, horse mackerel, yellowtail, Pacific mackerel, and 
red sea bream were found to contain 4-8 times lower levels of parvalbumin than the white 
 3muscles suggesting another basis for individual patient variability (Kobayashi et al., 
2006).  Similar results were obtained in studies of dark and white muscles of longtail tuna 
(Lim et al., 2005). 
 
Fish Allergens – Others
 
     In addition to the major parvalbumin allergen, some evidence exists for the possible 
presence of other minor allergens in various species of fish including codfish (Aas, 1966; 
Aukrust et al., 1978; Dory et al., 1998).  A 41 kDa protein, dissimilar to Gad c 1 with 
respect to molecular weight, isoelectric point, and proportion of hydrophobic amino acids 
was able to bind IgE from some cod-allergic individuals (Das Dores et al,, 2002b; 
Galland et al., 1998).  However, the clinical significance of this minor fish allergen has 
not been established. 
 
    An unidentified IgE-binding protein of 50 kDa was identified in two species of fish, 
hilsa and pomfret, that are popular in India (Das et al., 2005).  Curiously, these fish 
species did not appear to contain parvalbumin or any IgE-binding proteins migrating in 
that molecular weight range.  This immunoblotting study was not confirmed by oral 
challenges to document the clinical reactivity of the patients who provided the blood 
serum. 
 
     Hamada et al. (2001) identified a high molecular weight allergen detected in bigeye 
tuna muscle as collagen.  However the clinical significance of collagen as a fish allergen 
was not confirmed by oral challenge of fish-allergic individuals.  In subsequent studies, 
Hamada et al. (2003b) noted in IgE-binding studies that 10 of 15 fish-allergic patients 
reacted only to parvalbumin from bigeye tuna, while 2 of 15 fish-allergic patients reacted 
only to collagen, 2 of 15 patients reacted to both parvalbumin and collagen, and 1 of 15 
patients reacted to neither protein.  Except for IgE-binding studies, no other evaluations 
were done (challenges, skin tests, etc.) to document further the allergenicity of collagen.  
The sera of the collagen-reactive patients also reacted with collagen from other fish 
species including Japanese eel, alfonsin, mackerel, and skipjack (Hamada et al., 2003b). 
Thus, collagen appears to be a minor fish allergen, although more studies are needed to 
better gauge the prevalence of sensitization to fish collagen.  And, oral challenge studies 
would be useful to confirm the clinical relevance of fish collagen sensitization. 
  
Isinglass 
 
     Isinglass is prepared from the swim bladders, also known as fish maws, of various 
species of tropical fish.  The fish species most commonly used in the preparation of 
isinglass on a worldwide basis include corvina, purse, and several types of sea catfish.  
These are very large fish that also have large maws.  Since these fish are not commonly 
consumed beyond the local tropical areas in which they are caught, the allergenicity of 
these species of fish is not documented.  However, research has now confirmed the 
presence of parvalbumin in these species of fish (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, parvalbumin-
sensitized individuals seem likely to react to ingestion of these fish species although that 
has not been confirmed by oral challenge trials. 
 4 
     Isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines for 
many years.  Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported despite this widespread use. 
 
     Furthermore, fish maws are commonly consumed as food in many parts of the world 
especially in the form of fish maw soup.  Of the more than 3000 metric tons of fish maws 
that are consumed each year, only 240 metric tons are used for the production of isinglass 
for clarification of beers and ales.  The remainder is mostly eaten as fish maw soup.  
Allergic reactions to fish maw soup have also not been reported.  Although consumption 
of this product occurs primarily in countries where clinical allergy is not a common 
medical specialty e.g. China, consumption does also occur among Chinese populations in 
certain EU countries such as the U.K. that have excellent allergy specialization.  Allergic 
reactions to fish maws have also not been reported in any of these EU countries. 
However, research has now confirmed that fish maws from the species of fish used to 
produce isinglass do contain parvalbumin (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, the ingestion of fish 
maws by fish-allergic individuals should be avoided. 
 
     Collagen is the primary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 
kD are described for collagen preparations.  Fish maws are composed primarily of 
collagen.  The processing of the maws is not extensive because the objective is to retain 
the three-dimensional structure of collagen that allows it to entrap proteins and other 
haze-producing substances in alcoholic beverages.  Collagen is very insoluble and 
precipitates quickly upon addition to alcoholic beverages.  Since most of the collagen 
precipitates, extremely low levels of collagen would be expected to remain in the treated 
beverages.   
 
     Since isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major 
allergen from fish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around 
the presence of small amounts parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major 
allergen in several different species of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and 
tuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; 
Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et 
al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 
1999) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals with fish allergy (Taylor et al., 
2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the muscle and swim bladders of the 
fish species used in the manufacturing of isinglass has now been confirmed.  Thus, the 
detection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass seems to be a key factor 
in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material. 
 
     As has now been demonstrated in research funded by the isinglass industry, very low 
but detectable levels of parvalbumin do exist in isinglass as measured by ELISAs using 
both anti-carp parvalbumin and anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  The presence of very 
low levels of parvalbumin in isinglass is not surprising given its presence in the fish 
maws used to obtain the isinglass.  This same research has documented that the 
parvalbumin content of isinglass can be reduced by washing with phosphate buffer.  
Since parvalbumin is a highly soluble protein, this finding is also not surprising.  
 5However, the results documented that parvalbumin could not be eliminated completely 
from isinglass by washing.  The 3-dimensional structure of collagen likely allows it to 
entrap some parvalbumin which is then very difficult to remove. 
 
     The ultimate documentation of the safety of isinglass involves various clinical 
investigations with fish-allergic individuals.  Furthermore, skin testing of fish-allergic 
patients with fish muscle and fish maw extracts from the relevant species of fish 
demonstrated that the muscle and maws of these fish do contain parvalbumin because 
positive skin tests were obtained (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, these fish contain 
parvalbumin which is capable of provoking allergic reactions in the fish-allergic 
individuals.  A number of double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge tests with 
commercial isinglass have now been completed.  The isinglass used in these clinical trials 
was equivalent to the isinglass samples that was previously shown to contain trace 
quantities of parvalbumin (FARRP-08-2006).  The exposure doses (up to 30 mg for the 
highest individual dose and 50.5 mg cumulative dose) were beyond the levels of isinglass 
exposure from cask ale where exposure would be highest (using worst-case assumptions 
about the amount of residual isinglass, the cumulative challenge dose is equivalent to the 
levels of isinglass found in 50 liters of beer of 10 liters of cask ale consumed over a 2-hr 
time period; thus, even high-level consumers of beer and ale are unlikely to reach this 
level of exposure).  So far, 15 fish-allergic individuals have been challenged with 
isinglass and none have reacted.  Although oral challenges on additional patients are 
planned, the conclusion can already be reached that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit 
allergic reactions in the majority of fish-allergic consumers.  Additionally, under a 
separate clinical protocol, Dr. Fabienne Rance of Toulouse, France challenged 6 fish-
allergic patients with a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass and no adverse reactions 
were noted.  This challenge study, while limited to a small number of patients, adds 
support to the conclusion that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in the 
majority of fish-allergic consumers. 
 
Expert Opinion on Isinglass
 
     In releasing their opinion on isinglass in late 2004, the EFSA panel commented that 
evidence was needed regarding the possible presence of residues of isinglass in treated 
beers and also of the presence of residues of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Furthermore, the 
EFSA panel requested further research to establish whether isinglass may cause allergic 
reactions in fish-allergic individuals.  DBPCFC trials, in our opinion, would be the best 
approach to address this latter question. 
 
     As noted above, the research sponsored by Brewing Food and Beverage Industry  
Suppliers Association (BFBi) and the Brewers of Europe is answering all of these  
questions.  Research has been conducted to develop a suitable assay for parvalbumin  
residues in isinglass.  ELISAs were developed to detect parvalbumin using anti-frog,  
anti-carp, andanti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  All of these ELISAs were able to detect 
parvalbumins.  Trace quantities of parvalbumin were detected in commercial isinglass 
using the anti-cod and anti-carp parvalbumin ELISAs.  The ongoing DBPCFCs with 
isinglass on fish-allergic individuals have demonstrated that exposure to low levels of 
 6parvalbumin through the consumption of treated beers and ales is unlikely to be 
allergenic to fish-allergic consumers.   
 
    Exposure levels to parvalbumin in isinglass used to clarify beers and ales are likely to 
be extraordinarily low.  Based on current application levels of isinglass in beer for its 
clarification function and based upon the new knowledge of residual parvalbumin levels 
in isinglass, an estimated 0.05 μg of parvalbumin is added per liter of beer.  However, a 
prudent assumption would be that the parvalbumin mostly co-sediments with the 
isinglass.  Since maximum isinglass residues are estimated at 5 mg per liter in unfiltered 
ales (cask ale), a reasonable estimate of the level of parvalbumin in ale would be only 
0.0065 μg per liter.  The dosages of isinglass in the ongoing clinical challenge trial are 
0.5, 5.0, 15, and 30 mg which is equivalent to exposure of up to 50 liters of beer (and 10 
liters of cask ale).  This dosage range covers all reasonable levels of exposure to beer and 
should document whether isinglass ingestion presents any risk to fish-allergic consumers. 
 
    One remaining concern would relate to fish collagen as a fish allergen.  Evidence 
indicates that sensitization to fish collagen occurs in only a small percentage of fish-
allergic individuals (4 of 15 in fish-allergic patients studied in Japan).  Oral challenge 
trials have not been conducted to confirm that allergenicity of fish collagen in fish-
allergic individuals.  Furthermore, the fish collagen used in the Japanese studies may 
differ from isinglass and no evidence exists to indicate that the fish collagen-sensitized 
individuals would react to isinglass.  In our opinion, fish collagen is likely a minor fish 
allergen but it is likely a very minor allergen based on the lack of reactivity in the fish 
gelatin trials (Hansen et al., 2004).  Individuals with fish collagen sensitivity may be at 
some risk of ingestion of isinglass but that risk remains unproven especially at low 
challenge doses. 
  
     Although isinglass is an ingredient derived from a commonly allergenic food (fish) 
and despite the fact that isinglass contains protein derived from that source (in fact 
isinglass IS protein from fish), the oral challenge trials and other key evidence obtained 
in recent industry-sponsored studies indicates rather clearly that ingestion of isinglass 
does not present a risk to fish-allergic individuals.  This information is pivotal to any 
determination of need for source labeling of isinglass when it is used in clarification of 
beers and ales.

CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE

I undersigned, Dr Fabienne Rancé, that I have carried out a
clinical study on the allergenicity of isinglass according to a protocol in
the children hospital of Toulouse. The protocol was approved by the
Consultative Committee for Human Protection in Biomedical Research
(CPPRB) at Toulouse I on 17th March 2003.

This was a double-blind study using internationally recognised
standard tests. Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the
study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge was
performed. For each patient the test was performed twice: once
containing isinglass and once containing the placebo. The order of
administration of the tests was determined at random. The test
containing the substance was prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of
isinglass with 10 grammes of cooked potato.

Six patients with fish allergy, aged 6 to 22 years participated in
the study. Fish allergy was determined by oral food challenge or by a
convincing clinical history at the time of the study.

Size of skin prick test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE
specific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs,
cumulative reactogenic dose in mg) for fish and isinglass was
determined.

For this 6 fish allergic patients, we obtained 2 positive skin prick
test with isinglass, and 6 negative double-blind, placebo-controlled food
challenges with isinglass.

The study take its course in Toulouse to prospectively obtain 35
allergic patients and 5 non-allergic.

Biomedical Research (CPPRB) at Toulouse I on 17th March 2003 
 
 
I. State of Scientific Knowledge  
 
The frequency of fish allergy is regarded differently according to geographical location and 
food habits. In France, fish allergy corresponds to the 5th food allergy in children, and the 
14th food allergy in adults [1, 2]. 
 
Fish Allergy 
Fish form a very wide group with over 20,000 species. The first publication of fish allergy is 
attributed to Besche in Norway [3]. The in vitro work by Tuft [4] and Aas [5], analysing 
several species of fish, notes that fish allergies apply to all species due to cross reactivity 
between them. However certain fish allergies trigger allergic reactions only for a particular 
species. Fish allergy can therefore be isolated to a single species or include all fish:  it 
appears that 40% of patients tolerate at least one fish species [6, 7]. There is no cross 
reactivity between fish and crustaceans or molluscs. 
 
Allergens are agents capable of provoking pathological reactions in an individual sensitive to 
this allergen [8]. Allergens are proteins of molecular weight between 10 and 70 kDa [9]. Fish 
allergens belong to the family of parvalbumines, muscular proteins. The different 
parvalbumines are present in the sarcoplasma of fish muscular cells. The major allergen in 
cod was identified by Aas and Elsayed in 1971, then named according to international 
nomenclature Gad c 1 (Gadus callarias)  [10]. This is the M allergen of cod, a muscular 
protein (sarcoplasma of muscular cells) with MW 12.3 kDa, a family of parvalbumines 
bonding calcium [11]. It is resistant to denaturation and proteolysis. This is an important 
allergen for cod but is not present in all fish species. There are homologies of structure of the 
order of 34% between fish species. Cod also has other allergens, known as intermediary or 
minor, of which one with a molecular weight of 63 kDa is also found in surimi [12]. Recent 
works have also isolated the major allergen of Atlantic salmon Sal s 1 (Salmo salar) , 
muscular extract, parvalbumine family [13]. Cooking or smoking reduces the allergenicity. 
 
Fish Derivatives in the Drinks Industry 
The swim bladders of tropical species such as Aridae, Siluridae, Sciaenidae and 
Polynemidae are used for the preparation of a glue or isinglass. This technological aid is 
used essentially to clarify beer but also wines. It is a collagen of molecular weight 800 to 
 11300 kDa. The swim bladder undergoes several processes: drying, granulation, cleaning 
(physical and cold water) and solubilisation. 
 
In beer, as in wine, isinglass is used at the rate of 1 to 2 grammes per hl. After 
sedimentation, centrifuging and filtration, the highest value found in the end product for 
consumption is 0.16 ppm. These derivatives are t herefore difficult to implicate in allergies 
because of the non-muscular origin in fish, the very high molecular weight far greater than 
for listed allergens, and above all their presence at infinitesimally small levels. Despite the 
traditional use dating from the 18th century, to our knowledge there is no information in the 
literature mentioning an observation of allergy linked to this product. 
 
 
 
II. Purpose of the Study  
 
No work has studied the allergenicity of isinglass, used as a technological aid to clarify beers 
and wines. The allergenicity of isinglass has never been shown, although the allergic risk is 
low. At present we have supposition only. 
 
The main objective is to specify the allergenicity of fish-derived isinglass present in drinks by 
standardised double-blind allergy tests, by comparing the results obtained in patients allergic 
to fish and controls. 
 
 
 
III. Study Protocol  
 
This is a double-blind study using internationally recognised standard tests. 
 
Informed consent is obtained before inclusion in the study. A pregnancy test will be 
performed in girls and young women of child-bearing age. 
 
All patients will undergo the prick test for isinglass, placebo, different fish species, and 
positive and negative controls. 
 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge will be performed. For each 
patient the test is performed twice:  once containing isinglass and once containing the 
placebo. The order of administration of the tests is determined at random. The test 
containing the substance is prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of isinglass with 10 
grammes of cooked potato. This quantity has been selected to comply with the extreme 
conditions from the following hypotheses: 
 
* the maximum dose of use of isinglass in beer or wine is 2 g/hl, or 20 ppm 
* the maximum residual doses of the technological aid, isinglass, found in filtered beer is 
less than 0.16 ppm or 0.16 mg/l. As a precautionary measure, it is considered that these 
doses could be 20 times larger, or 3.2 mg/l 
* the quantity of beer ingested is considered as being excessive, 4 litres 
 
The placebo test contains only 10 g cooked potato. The mixture is given in 3 doses of 1, 3 
and 6 grammes at 30 minute intervals. The second test (substance or placebo depending on 
random allocation) is performed 2 hours after the end of the first test. A clinical examination 
with measurement is performed before the food challenge. The test is stopped as soon as a 
clinical sign appears. The patient fasts during the test with permission to drink water or apple 
juice. A meal is served 30 minutes after the end of the test. In the case of a reaction, food is 
served earlier to delay the absorption or dilute the allergen. A doctor and a nurse watch and 
 2report all symptoms. The monitoring covers the skin condition and searches for digestive 
and respiratory signs. Emergency treatment in the case of reaction is prepared before the 
start of the test and available during the test. A doctor with experience in allergies is present 
throughout the test. 
 
Number of patients 
40 patients aged 14 to 18 participate in the study (35 allergic to fish and 5 not allergic). It is 
necessary to obtain 35 consecutive allergic patients to establish that, in the absence of 
positive tests in the allergic patients, it can be concluded with a confidence interval of 95% 
and an α  risk of 5% that isinglass is non-allergenic for at least 90% of patients with fish 
allergy. The same tests with isinglass performed in just 5 patients not allergic to fish allows 
us to establish the absence of allergy to isinglass also in persons not allergic to fish. 
 
Choice of adolescent or young adult volunteers 
Recruitment is not possible amongst adults for successful performance of this study. The 
food allergy is three times more common in children than in adults. The study is easier to 
perform in young persons aged 14 to 18 years. The study cannot therefore be performed in 
any other way. 
 
Methods of recruitment 
Volunteers will be recruited by Dr. Rancé at the Children's Hospital, CHU Toulouse, on the 
basis of 2 groups:  one allergic group and one non-allergic group. The study is carried out 
prospectively to obtain 35 allergic patients and 5 non-allergic. Patients will be selected in the 
same location and time period (consecutive recruitment). 
 
Data analysis 
The data will be analysed at the Children's Hospital in Toulouse. It concerns the following 
indicators:  signs of fish allergy, size of cutaneous test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE 
specific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs, cumulative reactogenic 
dose in mg) for fish and isinglass. 
 
The statistical tests used are chi2 for qualitative variables, Student test for mean 
comparison, calculation of association force with OR and precision measurement with IC at 
95%. 
 
Civil liability insurance will be concluded by the sponsor, the company Lallemand.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_13.pdf,"Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006

A.  Introduction: 
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kilo Daltons (kD) are described for 
collagen preparations.  Parvalbumin, a comparatively small protein from fish muscle, is widely 
considered as the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004a).  Fish collagen is not 
considered as a major fish allergen.  Although swim bladders are composed primarily of 
collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  However, 
the presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly investigated and 
certainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Although parvalbumin is 
thought to be a ubiquitous protein in the muscles of all fish species, the presence of parvalbumin 
in the muscles of the fish species used in the preparation of isinglass has not been clearly 
demonstrated.  Furthermore, the allergenicity of these particular species of fish is also not well 
known even though another common assumption is that all species of fish are allergenic.  
Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-
sensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  
This observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
Skin testing was performed with extracts of fish muscle and swim bladders of the fish species 
used in the commercial manufacturing of isinglass.  The primary purpose of skin testing was to 
confirm the likely presence of parvalbumin in the muscle tissues of these unique species and to 
document the presence of parvalbumin in the swim bladders of these species.  This clinical 
investigation will serve to demonstrate that these fish and their swim bladders are likely to 
provoke allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals.

Whole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers 
used by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1.1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 
whole fish).  The whole fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-
like tissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was 
discarded.  In this report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1.1) and 
the description maw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.

All maw samples arrived in dried condition.  The processing background of these samples was 
unknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and 
covered with mold rendering this particular sample unusable.  Samples of maw and fish (after 
fillets were prepared) were stored until use at -20° C. 
 
Extraction buffer 
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to prepare extracts (see FARRP 08-2006 for details of 
optimization of extraction buffer).  PBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue 
number N400500) and contained per liter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na
2HPO4·2H2O and 0.3 g 
NaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  PBS was sterile and pyrogen free solution.  Containers with 
extraction buffer were only used once after opening.  
 
General extraction procedure 
Fish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a 
professional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-
mix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared 
by stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of PBS for 2 hours at room 
temperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4°C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml PP-
test tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 7 of 15 
  
Extracts were filtered over 0.22 μm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES 
[polyethersulfone] sterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic [Corning Inc., 
Acton, MA, USA]). After filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml 
polypropylene cryo vials, 12.5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner 
Bio-one catalogue number 121263).  Filtration and subdividing were done in a flow chamber.  
The extracts were aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at -80°C until distributed to 
the clinical test sites.  One vial of each extract was prepared for each subject.  The materials were 
distributed frozen and subsequently held frozen.  Once thawed for use, the material was used for 
only one subject on one day and then discarded.   
 
Protein concentration determination
Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using Bradford reagent from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, catalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as 
a standard (Sigma: A7906, minimum BSA content: 98%). 
 
Histamine analysis 
Histamine was measured with a Ridascreen Histamin kit (R1604, r-Biopharm, Darmstadt, 
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. All samples were measured once, in 
various dilutions. This assay is a competitive ELISA for the quantification of histamine in food 
 
pH determination 
In order to avoid cross contact between extracts, pH was determined using pH paper instead of a 
pH electrode (pH-Fix 0-14, Machery-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany, catalogue number 921 10) 
with an estimated accuracy of 0.5 pH unit. 
 
Microbiological testing
Skin test extracts were checked for sterility by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Food 
Processing Center Microbiological Services Laboratory. 
 
Parvalbumin concentration
Parvalbumin levels were determined by the ELISA method using anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibody as described in FARRP-07-2006.  The results are expressed in carp 
parvalbumin equivalents. 
 
  C.  Methods: 
 
Subject Selection
Fifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Thus far, 8 fish-allergic subjects have 
completed the skin testing challenge.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are consumed.  
Subjects were well characterized fish-allergic children and adults in generally good 
health.  Potential subjects were at least three years old and not older than 70 years.   Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 8 of 15 
  
  
2. Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish with a either commercial or 
fresh fish extract AND positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
a).  Recently performed skin prick tests as large or larger than the positive control 
histamine skin prick test or at least 3 mm in diameter. 
b).  Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. 
 
Since certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of the skin test 
responses, conventional antihistamines were discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing, long 
acting antihistamines were discontinued for at least 7 days prior to skin testing, and topical 
steroids were discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.  
Tricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin were withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing. 
Topical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and were avoided at skin test sites.  
 
Skin testing procedure
 
Skin prick testing was done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the cleansed 
volar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a 
sterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same 
fashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution 
(1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify subjects for this study were either 
fresh cod extracts or commercial products expressly prepared for diagnostic skin testing.  The 
commercial extract was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.   Experimental 
skin test materials were prepared by the procedures described above. 
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts were judged and recorded based on the size of the wheal (raised 
welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as compared to the positive and 
negative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-inspected at 30 minutes.   The SPT is 
deemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests and needed 
to be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT or at least 3 mm in diameter to be 
considered positive.   
 
Ethics board approvals were obtained from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and from the 
participating clinical centers. 
 
D.  Results: 
 
Protein and parvalbumin content
The skin test extracts from fish muscle and swim bladders (maws) had somewhat lower protein 
levels than reported previously in FARRP-08-2006 probably because of the ultrafiltration for 
sterilization.  The protein and parvalbumin levels are shown in Table 1.2.

Skin Tests with Fish-Allergic Individuals
Skin testing as described above has been completed on 8 fish-allergic subjects at the clinic in 
Odense, Denmark.  As noted, skin testing of 7 additional individuals is planned in Denmark and 
England but those results are not yet available. 
 
All eight fish-allergic subjects had positive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish fillet 
muscles of each of the fish noted in Table 1.2.  Seven of the eight fish-allergic subjects had 
positive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish swim bladders (maws) of each of the fish 
noted in Table 1.2.  The eighth subject had positive skin test reactions to 5 of the 6 swim bladder 
extracts but had a negative response to a prick test with the extract of swim bladder of  FA 13/05 
(Bagrus pseudopimelodus sp.). 
 
E. Discussion 
 
These results indicate rather clearly that the fish muscle of these tropical fish species contain 
parvalbumin and that the parvalbumin is cross-reactive with IgE antibodies in European subjects 
sensitized to fish eaten more commonly in Europe.  This result is not particularly surprising 
because parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen (Taylor et al., 2004a) that should be found 
in the edible muscle tissues of all fish species.  However, while the levels of protein in the fish 
muscle extracts were reasonably consistent from species to species, the levels of apparent 
parvalbumin were quite variable.  In earlier reports, three different ELISAs for parvalbumin 
were developed and shown to have differing specificities for parvalbumin from various species 
of fish.  Thus, this result should be attributed, at least in part, to possible specificity issues arising 
from use of the monoclonal anti-carp parvalbumin antibody in this particular ELISA.  While the 
allergenicity of the muscle tissue of these species of fish has not been confirmed by oral Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 10 of 15 
  
challenge tests, the presence of parvalbumin in these tissues strongly suggests that fish-allergic 
individuals should avoid consumption of the muscle tissue of these fish. 
 
The extracts of the swim bladders had considerably lower protein levels by comparison to the 
muscle extracts (Table 1.2).  Certainly, this is due to the insoluble nature of the collagen, the 
predominant protein in swim bladders which is thus unlikely to be present in large amounts in 
the saline extracts.  Parvalbumin levels in the extracts of the swim bladders are lower (in 5 of 6 
cases) than parvalbumin levels in muscle extracts.  However, this investigation confirms that the 
swim bladders of these 6 species of fish contain parvalbumin.  While the swim bladder of the 
oyster toadfish has previously been known to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), the 
ubiquity of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders of various species had not been thoroughly 
investigated.  These results demonstrate that parvalbumin is present in swim bladders from all of 
these species so perhaps parvalbumin is ubiquitously present in fish swim bladders.    
 
The swim bladder extract of the black sea catfish contained higher levels of apparent 
parvalbumin than did the muscle extract of that species.  However, that result could also be a 
function of the comparative specificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody.  The parvalbumin 
types in swim bladder and muscle could be different leading to variable recognition by the 
various antibodies to parvalbumin.  It would be interesting to repeat this result with the anti-frog 
and anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies but we have not yet done that experiment. 
 
Since fish swim bladders also contain parvalbumin, the ingestion of fish maws is likely 
hazardous for fish-allergic individuals.  Fish maw soup is consumed in several countries 
including China.  Again, oral challenge trials would be necessary to confirm the hazards 
associated with fish maws but caution would certainly be prudent based upon the existing 
results. 
 
Since the muscle tissue and maws of these fish species used to manufacture isinglass contain 
parvalbumin, the allergenicity of isinglass is likely related to residual levels of parvalbumin in 
commercial isinglass.  As previously noted (see FARRP-08-2006), very low levels of residual 
parvalbumin were found in isinglass.  The following section will describe the results of clinical 
oral challenge trials with isinglass on fish-allergic individuals which will determine the 
allergenic hazard, if any, associated with ingestion of isinglass by such individuals.

  A.  Introduction:  
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for collagen 
preparations.  Parvalbumin, a comparatively small protein from fish muscle, is widely 
considered as the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004a).  Fish collagen is not 
considered as a major fish allergen.  Although swim bladders are composed primarily of 
collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  
Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-
sensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  
This observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
   
A clinical challenge trial was needed to confirm this suspicion that ingestion of typical quantities 
of isinglass does not pose a hazard to fish-allergic individuals.  In this section of the report, the 
results of oral challenges of 15 fish-allergic individuals are presented.  
 
B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Subject Selection
Twenty-nine fish-allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based on the guidelines put 
forth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the threshold doses for allergenic foods:  
how much is too much?” (Taylor et al., 2004b).   Thus far, 15 subjects have completed the oral 
challenge trials.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects were well characterized fish-allergic children and adults 
in generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  Subjects with 
severe reactions to fish were not excluded. 
 
2.   Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish AND positive specific 
IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
a).  Recently performed skin prick test as large or larger than the positive 
control histamine skin prick test, or at least 3 mm in diameter. 
b). Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. 
 
The subjects enrolled in this challenge trial ceased taking all prescribed medications related to 
their allergies for suitable withdrawal periods before commencement of the challenge trial.  In 
particular, H
1 anti-histamines with a short duration of activity were withheld for a minimum of 
48 hours.  Hydroxyzine was withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 12 of 15 
  
antagonists were withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti-histamines (cetirizine) 
were withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of patients with co-existing or food-induced 
asthma, short-acting inhaled or oral beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics were continued up 
to 6 hours before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists were stopped 12 hours before challenge.  
Chromones (cromolyn and nedocromil) were withheld for 48 hours.  Inhaled steroids or oral 
corticosteroids were continued in patients where prescribed, although patients with serious 
asthma were not included in this challenge.   
 
Caffeine and alcohol were also excluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  Females of child-
bearing age were required to have a negative pregnancy test each day that oral challenges were 
given. 
 
Oral challenge procedure
Oral challenges were performed in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion on two separate 
days (randomly assigned placebo and isinglass challenge days).  The isinglass challenge material 
was a commercially available product supplied by worldwide isinglass manufacturers and 
representative of isinglass as manufactured currently.  This isinglass material has also been 
analyzed for residual parvalbumin (see FARRP-08-2006).  The isinglass was disguised in 
mashed potatoes and the inability to distinguish between potatoes containing isinglass and 
placebo potatoes was confirmed by sensory evaluation.  Subjects were challenged with four 
doses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned mashed potato preparation.  The doses were 0.5 mg, 
5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg isinglass in about 40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing 
amount.  Four portions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass were given on a different day 
and act as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses were given at 30-minute 
intervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo were provided (all in blinded fashion) in the 
event that a dose needed to be repeated.  Doses could be repeated if there was a question about 
the objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction was observed after the duplicate dose, the 
next dose was given. 
 
Dehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge material were pre-weighed into challenge containers 
in a food grade facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Preparation of the challenge 
material at the clinical investigation site required the addition of nearly boiling water to the 
challenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, allowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, 
mixing and then presenting to the subject.  The challenge order was randomized for each subject 
and all challenge materials blinded before shipping to the clinical investigation site.

These subjects also reported on their consumption of alcoholic beverages (Table 2.2).  These 
individuals reported that they regularly consumed beers, ales, and wines without incident.  The 
alcoholic beverages are likely to have been treated with isinglass on at least some occasions.  
This small survey was conducted to document that fish-allergic individuals do not avoid 
isinglass-treated beverages.

None of the 15 individuals challenged thus far has reacted adversely to the isinglass challenge.  
Therefore, consumption of a cumulative dose of 50.5 mg of isinglass or an upper dose of 30 mg 
of isinglass occurred without provocation of any adverse reactions.  One subject had a mild 
adverse reaction (skin rash) to placebo but not to isinglass.  This response was the only objective 
symptom encountered during the oral challenge trials.  Three subjects each experienced mild 
subjective reactions (e.g. palatal itching) to placebo and isinglass at initial doses used in the trial.  
However, these symptoms resolved quickly and further doses of either placebo or isinglass were 
administered without these or other symptoms developing.  Thus, these subjective reactions do 
not appear to be related to the challenge trial.  
 
D.  Discussion: 
 
While our ultimate aim is to enroll 29 fish-allergic patients in the isinglass challenge trial, only 
15 subjects have completed the challenges so far.  However, none of these patients has reacted 
adversely to the administration of a cumulative challenge dose of 50.5 mg of isinglass.  This 
amount of isinglass is far in excess of the amount that might be achieved with beer and wine 
consumption.  Cask ale, under certain circumstances, may allow higher levels of isinglass 
exposure but the 50.5 mg cumulative dose was intended to represent a worst-case scenario that is Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 15 of 15 
  
even beyond the exposure levels that likely occur with cask ale.  Thus, this challenge trial 
confirms that fish-allergic individuals may safely consume alcoholic beverages that have been 
treated with isinglass.

Determination of the Allergenicity of Isinglass in Fish Allergic Individuals 
 
Isinglass is a product composed principally of collagen derived mainly from the swim 
bladders of certain species of tropical and subtropical fish (corvina, threadfin, croaker, 
and others), although cod, sturgeon and hake swim bladders may also be used 
occasionally (1).   
 
Isinglass is a processing aid used to clarify beers, ales, wines, and champagnes of  
yeasts, proteins, and other macromolecular components used or created during the 
fermentation process (1).  Without use of clarifying agents, these alcoholic beverages 
would be cloudy rather than clear.  Because the collagen molecules are amphoteric, the 
negative charges attract and bind to yeast cells while the positive charges attract and 
bind to proteins.  Furthermore, isinglass is highly insoluble and its addition results in 
immediate clarification of the liquid.  Clarification can be achieved with a rather low level 
of addition of isinglass, typically in the range of 0.001% to 0.002% (2).  In most cases, 
the isinglass and the components that precipitate with it are removed by filtration or 
centrifugation before packaging of the beverage.  In those situations, exposure to 
isinglass in the beverage as consumed would be quite low because the majority of it is 
likely removed.  Residue levels in filtered beer have been measured in the range of 0.02 
– 0.16 parts per million (ppm) or mg/l (2).  Cask ale, a popular beverage in the U.K., is 
an exception where the precipitated mass is left in the bottom of the cask.  In this case, 
isinglass exposure can be higher for consumers of cask ale especially as the cask is 
tipped and some sludge from the bottom of the cask may be intermixed with the ale.  
The levels of residual isinglass in cask ale have not been measured and, as noted, are 
likely to be variable from glass to glass. 
 
Because it is derived from a major allergenic food source, namely fish, the allergenicity 
of isinglass to fish-allergic individuals is a question of interest.  Fish are considered to 
be one of the most commonly allergenic foods in the human diet (1).  Fish and 
ingredients derived from fish are included on lists of commonly allergenic foods in 
countries in which such lists exist including the US, EU., Canada, and Australia/New 
Zealand (1).  Isinglass is certainly an ingredient derived from fish although its 
allergenicity has not been established.  Thus, regulations in these countries and regions 
would require that isinglass be labeled on the alcoholic beverages and that its fish origin 
also be declared unless an exemption could be granted.  Some countries and regions 
including the EU and US provide for the possibility of labeling exemptions in cases 
where the lack of allergenicity of the ingredient can be established. 
 
Fish-allergic individuals are typically advised to avoid ingestion of all species of fish and 
ingredients derived from fish.  While it has been observed clinically that some fish-
allergic individuals are tolerant of certain species of fish, the basis for this tolerance has 
not been elucidated (3).  In other clinical studies, fish-allergic individuals appear to be 
sensitive to all species of fish (4,5).  The major allergen of fish has been identified as 
parvalbumin, a muscle protein (6).  Parvalbumin appears to be a pan-allergen that 
exists in the edible muscle tissue of all fish (7,8).  Parvalbumin has been described to 
 1also occur in the swim bladders of some fish species (9) but the level and allergenicity 
of this parvalbumin has not been determined.  A few reports exist of other higher 
molecular weight protein allergens from fish (7, 10).  Collagen isolated from fish muscle, 
not swim bladder, has been identified as one of these allergens (10).  However, only a 
few Japanese patients have thus far been identified with IgE reactivity to fish collagen 
(7) and its allergenicity by oral challenge has not been documented.  Furthermore, the 
comparative lack of allergenicity of another fish collagen product, fish gelatin made from 
fish skins, in fish-allergic subjects has been documented (11). 
 
Isinglass may contain residual parvalbumin although the level of parvalbumin in 
isinglass has not been determined analytically (this is another research objective that is 
being simultaneously pursued).  Despite centuries of use in wines, ales, and beers, 
allergic reactions to isinglass have not been reported in the clinical literature (1).  The 
objective of this clinical trial is to determine the potential allergenicity of commercially 
produced isinglass in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
Objective:  Determine the allergenicity of isinglass by performing double blind placebo 
controlled food challenges in fish allergic individuals. 
 
Overview:  Twenty-nine fish allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based 
on the guidelines put forth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the 
threshold doses for allergenic foods:  how much is too much?” (12).   Oral food 
challenges will be performed according to the following protocol by clinical collaborators 
with challenge materials supplied by FARRP.  The amount of isinglass used for the 
challenges will reflect typical exposure amounts. 
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the 
use of human subjects at their specific institutions.  
 
Statistical Design:  The proposed sample size of 29 subjects is based upon the 
assumption that no subjects will react at the lowest challenge dose and assuming that if 
a subject reacts to one dose, then they will also react to higher doses.  If 29 subjects 
are challenged and a dose is identified where 0/29 subjects reacts, then there is 95% 
confidence that 90% of fish-allergic individuals will not react to this amount of isinglass 
or less.  The sample size of 29 is based upon the hypothesis that the reaction rate is 
equal to 10%. 
 
Data analysis plan 
We will attempt to set a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) as well as estimate 
the false positive rate and the proportion of truly sensitive individuals.  Data will be 
captured as reaction / no reaction for each dose of active challenge material. The 
placebo reaction rate will be taken into account as follows:

also react to higher doses, these are scored as + 
 
The number of positive and negative placebo and active reactions will be tallied and 
entered into the formula of Briggs et al. (13) and calculated as outlined in Hansen et al. 
(11) and illustrated below.

The above formula will allow for an estimate of a false positive rate (0.069 in the above 
example) and an estimate of the proportion of truly sensitive individuals (0.037 in the 
above example).   None of the 29 subjects in the above example reacted to the 5 mg 
challenge dose therefore 5 mg would be the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL).  
 
 
 
 
 3Subject Criteria:  Potential subjects must have: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and 
adults in generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  
Subjects with severe reactions to fish should be included so that this segment 
of the fish-allergic population is not overlooked. 
  
2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a 
pan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract 
provides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial 
extract AND
 positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
 a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months 
 previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters 
 need to be reported in millimeters and be as  large, or larger than the positive 
 control histamine skin prick test. 
 b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach 
 since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of 
 fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 
 kU
A/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual 
 specific IgE score in kU A/L must be reported. 
 
  3. Subjects enrolled in this challen ge trial should cease taking all prescribed   
   medications related to their allergie s for suitable withdrawal periods before  
   commencement of the challe nge trial.  In particular, H1 anti-histamines with a  
   short duration of activity should be withheld for a minimum of 48 hours.    
   Hydroxyzine is to be withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor 
   antagonists should be withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti- 
   histamines (cetirizine) should be withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of  
   patients with co-existin g or food-induced asthma, short-acting inhaled or oral  
   beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics could be continued up to 6 hours  
   before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists should be stopped 12 hours   
   before challenge.  Chromones (cromo lyn and nedocromil) should be withheld  
   for 48 hours.  Inhaled ster oids or oral corticosteroids would be continued in  
   patients where prescri bed, although patients with serious asthma should not  
   be included in this challenge.  If pati ents are taken off of routine medications,  
   the challenge trials must be conducted in a manner that any reactions arising  
   from the withdrawal of medications can be distinguished from true reactions  
   to the food incorporated into the challenge trial.   
 
  4. Caffeine and alcohol should also be ex cluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  
   Females of child-bearing age must hav e a negative pregnancy test each day  
   that oral challenges are given. 
 
 4Methods and Procedures: 
 
Skin Prick Test (SPT) 
  
Skin prick testing is done by placing a drop of commercially prepared fish extract (from 
any fish species or mixture of fish species as noted above) on the cleansed forearm or 
back of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  
Negative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same fashion with saline 
solution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution, respectively.  
All of the SPT materials are commercial products and are expressly prepared for 
diagnostic skin testing.  
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the 
wheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as 
compared to the positive and negative control skin tests after 15-30 minutes.   A SPT is 
deemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin tests.  A small 
amount of reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account 
when judging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the 
wheal at the site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening.  
The size of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 15 mm or larger 
wheal diameter, with a flare around the wheal that is hardly visible to one that may have 
a diameter of 50 mm or more.  This wheal and flare response to fish should be at least 
as large as the positive histamine control SPT.  Extremely large wheal and flare 
reactions are uncommon when using commercially prepared skin test reagents, but may 
occur on occasion.  The result is recorded by measuring the diameter of the wheal and 
the diameter of the wheal and flare.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should 
be noted (i.e. pseudopodia). 
 
The size of the wheal and flare is not necessarily indicative of the severity of the 
reaction that may be experienced when fish is ingested, or the amount of fish required 
to cause a reaction.    
 
Blood draw (venipuncture) 
 
A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm for RAST testing.  The blood will 
be processed into serum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the 
serum can be submitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific 
IgE to fish requires only a few milliliters of serum. 
 
Oral Challenge Description 
 
Oral challenges will occur in a clinical setting allowing prompt medical treatment if 
necessary during the challenge.  Subjects will be monitored by qualified medical 
personnel.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject will have a severe reaction 
during skin prick testing or oral challenge, a code cart or special emergency supplies 
including intubation equipment and defibrillator will be available and epinephrine and 
 5other medications will be administered according to the level and severity of reaction.  
Clinical Investigators may deem it necessary for some subject to have an intravenous 
line placed for rapid medical treatment.   Standard biophysical measurements will be 
made before each dose: pulse, blood pressure.  If appropriate, some clinical 
investigators may wish to monitor peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), but this is not 
required.   Subjective symptoms should be recorded on the FARRP Isinglass Study 
Challenge Data Sheet, but the challenge should continue until objective symptoms are 
observed, unless the subject cannot tolerate the subjective symptoms.  Investigators 
may wish to consider photographs or digital images to document visible reactions (i.e. 
skin reactions). 
 
Subjects will be challenged with four doses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned 
mashed potato preparation.  The doses will be 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg 
isinglass in 20-40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing amount.  Four 
portions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass will be given on a different day and 
act as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses will be given at 30-minute 
intervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo will be provided (all in blinded fashion) 
in the event that a dose needs to be repeated.  Doses should be repeated if there is a 
question about the objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction is observed after 
the duplicate dose, the next dose should be given.  
 
The isinglass challenge material will be a commercially available product supplied by 
The Allied Brewery Trading Association of the U.K which represents most of the 
isinglass manufacturers of the world.  Dehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge 
material will be pre-weighed into challenge containers in a food grade facility at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln by the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator. 
 
Preparation of the challenge material at the clinical investigation site will require the 
addition of nearly boiling water to the challenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, 
allowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, mixing and then presenting to the 
subject.  Newly purchased Pyrex containers and graduated cylinders will be provided to 
heat and measure the water.  These containers will require cleaning by clinical 
investigator prior to each challenge prepared and used exclusively for this study.  The 
challenge may be served in the same container in which the material is rehydrated. The 
clinical investigator will need a method of heating the water.  A microwave oven works 
well for this as does an electric tea kettle. 
 
Challenge materials will be randomized, blinded and the challenge order randomized 
before shipping to the clinical investigation site. 
 
Benefits  
 
The direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not isinglass is an allergy risk for 
him or her.  Results from all of the subjects will be used to determine labeling policies 
for isinglass-containing products. 
 6  
Risks 
 
Skin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in 
allergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (15-
20). The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito 
bite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a 
few minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. 
 
The drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks 
can occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may 
remain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally 
associated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur 
at the site of the venipuncture.  
 
The subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the 
skin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin 
prick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin 
prick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered 
according to the level and severity of reaction.  
 
The precise risk of anaphylaxis from the food challenge is unknown.  In a recent study 
examining the risks of oral food challenges, 253 oral challenges resulted in reactions 
with foods to which the subject was allergic (21).  Most reactions to all foods in this 
study were classified as mild to moderate with 28% of the reactions categorized as 
severe.  The lowest median dose associated with a severe allergic reaction was 0.6 
grams of milk.  There was a similar risk of severe reactions regardless of the food in the 
challenge.  Overall, all reactions were reversible with short-acting histamine with or 
without epinephrine, β-agonists, and/or corticosteroids.  No subjects required 
hospitalization.  The authors note that there are risks associated with food challenges, 
but these risks are reasonable when challenges are performed under the guidance of 
and experienced practitioner in a properly equipped setting.  Nursing and physician staff 
will be present during the oral food challenge.  In the event that the subject has a 
reaction during the oral food challenge, emergency supplies and medications will be 
available and be administered according to the level and severity of reaction. 
   
Recruiting Procedures 
 
Each clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for their location.  
Suggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, and 
recruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also be 
sent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include examples 
of letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human subjects use 
committee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical investigator’s 
local human subjects use committee. 
 
 7Compensation 
A per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site 
should propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, 
supplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal 
preparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  
Compensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when 
allowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  Clinical investigators may want to recompense the 
subject for completing specific parts of the study: for example, a set amount would be 
given for undergoing skin prick tests or blood draw; an additional amount would be 
given for completing the oral challenge. The compensation amount is to be determined 
by and paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per 
subject cost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  
Instructions for invoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are 
distributed to the clinical investigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without 
receipt of deliverables by FARRP. 
 
Informed Consent Forms 
Each clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to 
conform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use 
committee.   
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
This procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each 
clinical investigator. 
 
Maintaining Confidentiality 
Each clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP 
Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Isinglass Study Challenge 
Data Sheet “will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain subject 
names, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to FARRP.  At the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” 
and the “Isinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” will be stored in a locked file.  Only the 
Clinical Study Coordinator and the Co-Directors of FARRP will have access to this 
information.  In publications or reports using information collected from this work, the 
subjects will either be referred to as a collective or be identified by a subject number or 
other appropriate blinded designation. 
 
Copy of Questionnaire and Datasheets   
Copies of the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP 
Isinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” are included for submittal with clinical 
investigators’ proposal to their institute’s human subjects use committee. 
 
Funding  
This project is being funded by the Food Allergy Research & Resource Program at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE USA.  If you require a letter indicating this, 
contact Julie A. Nordlee, FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator.   
 8 
Contract 
Each clinical investigator will be asked to sign a contract with FARRP and the University 
of Nebraska which will detail the deliverables to FARRP, the agreed upon per subject 
cost and details regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement between FARRP 
and the clinical investigator and their institution. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
A two-member board will be established consisting of two allergists with experience in 
double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be reported to the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator by fax, phone and email within 24 
hours.  A standardized form to report these events will be provided to the clinical 
collaborators with the challenge material instructions. The FARRP Clinical Study 
Coordinator will immediately fax or email the SAE report form to the Board.  The Board 
will convene a teleconference within 48 hours to discuss what actions, if any, should be 
taken.  The Board will have 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments 
to the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators.   The Board will 
also be charged with examining, discussing and producing a short report of its findings 
for all adverse event data to be supplied to the Board by the FARRP Clinical Study 
Coordinator.  The Board will convene a teleconference or electronic mail 
correspondence every three months until the completion of the study or when 50% of 
the subjects have completed the challenges, which ever occurs first.  The Board will 
have 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments to the FARRP Clinical 
Study Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators. 
 
1. Each member of the Board will be paid a stipend of $150 per meeting.  
 
2. In the event that the death of a subject occurs during the course of the study, 
the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator will be contacted immediately and all 
procedures at all clinical study sites will cease until further notice.  Other SAEs 
will be evaluated as indicated above and according to the SAE Report form. 
 
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event or reaction is defined as any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution.  This 
includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: 
 
• Death:  A death occurring during the study must be reported. 
• Life-threatening:  Any adverse therapy ex perience that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Other conditions as specified in the protocol. 
• An event that requires intervention to pr event permanent impairment or damage.  An 
important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
 9hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 
• Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject temporally associated with the 
challenge material, whether or not considered related to the challenge material.   
• An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable or unintended sign or symptom temporally 
associated with the challenge material. 
• These occurrences should be reported on the Challenge Data Sheet.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine.

Determination of Skin Reactivity to Unique Fish Species 
 
1.  DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 
 
Objective:  By means of routine methods used by clinicians in allergy practice, 
determine the potential allergenicity of unique fish species by performing skin prick tests 
in fish allergic individuals. 
 
Background:  Though not specifically confirmed by clinical studies, fish allergic 
individuals are believed to be potentially reactive to all species of fish (1).  Hundreds of 
fish species exist worldwide that are used for human consumption or to make food 
ingredients including fermented fish sauces, isinglass, fish gelatin, fish oil, and collagen. 
Specifically, this research project is part of a larger effort aimed at assessing the 
potential allergenicity of isinglass.  Isinglass is a fish-derived ingredient used in the 
clarification of beers, wine, ales, and champagnes (1).  Isinglass is obtained from the 
swim bladders of certain species of fish, usually large tropical fish, including croaker, 
threadfin, corvina, and others (1).  Isinglass is composed primarily of collagen (2).  
Edible fish muscle contains an allergenic protein called parvalbumin, a calcium-binding 
protein involved in muscle contraction (3).  Parvalbumin is thought to exist in the muscle 
tissues of all fish species and has specifically been found in a large number of fish 
species including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel, tuna, and others (3-8).  Parvalbumin is 
theorized to be the pan-allergen that is responsible for fish allergies and its ubiquity in 
fish muscle is the reason why fish-allergic individuals are believed to react to all fish 
species.  Moreover, parvalbumin is known to exist in the swim bladders of at least one 
fish species [toadfish] (9).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in the unique fish 
species used to make isinglass or in the swim bladders from these fish has not been 
established.  The commercial process for making isinglass likely results in the removal 
of some of the water-soluble parvalbumin.  Skin testing with extracts prepared from the 
flesh and swim bladders of these unique fish will provide additional information to 
support or refute the premise that fish allergic individuals could be potentially reactive to 
all species of fish.  Skin testing would be useful in ascertaining whether parvalbumin is 
present in the swim bladders of these unique species.  
 
Overview:  Fifteen fish allergic individuals will be selected.  The subject selection will be 
based on a history of allergy to fish species commonly consumed such as cod, salmon 
and tuna, etc. and positive skin prick tests to commercial skin test extracts prepared 
from these same types of fish.  The selected subjects will be skin prick tested with 
materials prepared from the flesh and swim bladders of the unique species of fish used 
to make isinglass, that are not commonly ingested in the United States or European 
Union.   
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the 
use of human subjects at their specific institutions.   Copies of these approvals must be 
provided to FARRP before skin-test materials will be provided.  These approvals will be 
provided to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln IRB when received. 
 12.  METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
 
Procedure Overview:  Qualified subjects will be skin prick tested with 12 extracts 
derived from different unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders as well as a 
positive control solution (1% histamine), and negative control solution [extraction buffer 
containing sodium chloride and phosphates at or near neutral pH (7.0-7.5)].  Time 
required for the subject will be 1.5-3 hours.   
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols to the ethics or human 
subjects use committee and receive approval for the use of human subjects at his or her 
specific institutions.  The following clinicians have expressed an interest in participating 
as our collaborators:

FWA00006996 
   
 
Specific Methods and Procedures: 
 
Skin prick testing and blood draws are needed to qualify subjects for the study. 
 
Skin Prick Test (SPTs) 
  
Skin prick testing is done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the 
cleansed volar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking 
the skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are 
done in the same fashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract 
and histamine solution (1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify 
subjects for this study should be commercial products and are expressly prepared for 
diagnostic skin testing.  The commercial extract will be used in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions.   Other skin test materials will be provided and prepared in 
the laboratory by the procedures described below. 
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the 
wheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as 
compared to the positive and negative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-
inspected at 30 minutes.   The diameters of wheal and flare reactions will be measured 
in millimeters and recorded for each time point.  A SPT is deemed positive by 
comparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests.  A small amount of 
 2reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account when 
judging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the wheal at 
the site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening (14).  The 
size of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 14 mm or larger wheal 
diameter (14), with a flare around the wheal that may range from hardly visible to one 
that may have a diameter of 50 mm or more.  The wheal and flare response to fish 
extracts should be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT to be 
considered positive.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should be noted (i.e. 
pseudopodia). 
 
Blood draw (venipuncture) 
 
A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm.  The blood will be processed into 
serum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the serum can be 
submitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific IgE to fish 
requires only a few milliliters of serum. 
  
Preparation of Non-Commercial Skin Prick Test Materials 
 
Fish extracts of the flesh and swim bladders of six selected unique fish species (see 
following table) will be prepared by PodiCeps BV, Houten The Netherlands.  Extracts 
will be prepared using the most optimal extraction buffer.  At least 100 ml of extract will 
be prepared for each species by the following steps.  Sterility checks of the extracts will 
be performed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Food Science and 
Technology Microbiological Services Laboratory.  Histamine analysis will be performed 
using Neogen Corporation Veratox® Quantitative Histamine Test in the laboratory of Dr. 
Sue Hefle, Food Allergy Research and Resource Program, Department of Food 
Science and Technology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
 
1.  Crude extracts of each unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders will be   
  prepared using extraction buffer containi ng sodium chloride and phosphates at or 
  near neutral pH (7.0-7.5).  One part fi nely chopped or ground fish flesh or swim  
  bladder will be mixed with 10 parts extrac tion buffer and mixed overnight at 4-  
  6°C.  Before the extraction procedur e the swim bladders will be milled to a   
  nominal size of 4 cm and washed in a 2% hydrogen peroxide solution for 30   
  minutes before rinsing and drying. 
2. The crude extract will be clar ified by centrifugation. 
3.  The supernatant material resulting from  the centrifugation will be sterilized by   
  filtration using 0.22 µm  sterile  memb ranes in a laminar flow chamber and    
  packaged aseptically in the chamber. 
4.  The protein content of  the sterilized extract will be determined using the Bradford  
  method (15).  If necessary the extracts  will be diluted using sterile extraction   
  buffer in a laminar flow chamber to a pr otein content within the range reported in  
  commercially available skin pr ick test extracts for fish. 
5.  The resulting material will be aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at 
  -80°C until distributed to the clinical test  sites.  One vial of each extract will be  
 3  prepared for each subject.  The materi als will be distributed frozen and     
  subsequently held frozen.  Once thaw ed for use, the material will be     
  used for only one subject on one day and then discarded.   
6.  Histamine content will be determined using immunoassay methods (Neogen   
  Corp, Lansing, MI).  To assure that the unique fish starting materials have not  
  been subjected to spoilage conditions the level of histamine in the non-    
  commercial fish skin prick test extracts must be less than 0.005% (16).  If the   
  level of histamine is greater than or equal to 0.005% new materials will be    
  obtained and the extractions remade. 
7.  Information/fact sheets of each unique fi sh flesh and swim bladder extract will be  
  prepared and shipped to the clinical co llaborators together with the extracts.   
  Facts sheets will contain information on: pr otein content, salt content, pH and   
  histamine content.

3. SUBJECT CRITERIA 
 
Fifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Potential subjects must have: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and 
adults in generally good health.  Potential subjects must be at least three 
years old and not older than 70 years.   
  
2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a 
pan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract 
provides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial 
fish extract AND
 positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
 a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months 
 previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters 
 need to be reported in millimeters and be, as large or larger than the positive
 control histamine skin prick test. 
 b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach 
 since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of 
 fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 
 4 kU A/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual 
 specific IgE score in kU A/L and the method used must be reported. 
 
  3. Certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of  
   the skin test wheal and flare responses elicited by allergen extracts and   
   histamine positive control. Conv entional antihistamines should be     
   discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines  
   should be discontinued for at least 7 da ys prior to skin testing.  Topical    
   steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3     
   weeks before skin testing (10,11).  Tr icyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin  
   should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing (12) Topical local  
   anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided at skin  
   test sites (13). 
 
 
Statistical Design 
The working hypothesis for this project is that the unique fish species used in the 
production of isinglass will be allergenic as documented by positive skin prick tests in 
individuals with well documented allergies to more frequently consumed fish.  If this 
hypothesis is true, then all of the patients will display positive skin prick tests to the 
extracts of the various species of fish used in this study.  Since the subjects selected for 
this study will have allergies to fish and these fish are known to contain parvalbumin as 
their major allergen, this finding will also provide proof that these unique fish species 
contain parvalbumin that is cross-reactive with parvalbumin from the more commonly 
ingested species.  If one or more of the unique fish species in this study contain no 
parvalbumin or low levels of parvalbumin, then some or all subjects may have negative 
skin prick test reactions to those extracts.  Similar determinations will be made for the 
swim bladder extracts from the unique fish species except that it is much less certain 
that the swim bladders will contain sufficient allergen to provoke a positive skin prick 
test reaction.  Statistically, we expect significantly higher numbers of positive skin prick 
test reactions in the subjects to the various unique fish extracts than to the negative 
control skin prick tests.   
 
4.  BENEFITS AND RISKS  
 
Benefits  
 
The direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not there is a potential for him or 
her to be allergic to these unique species of fish if ingested.  Results from all of the 
subjects will be used to determine if the swim bladders contain parvalbumin and thus 
whether isinglass used in processing of alcoholic beverages (beer, champagne, ale and 
wine) might be a risk for fish allergic individuals. 
 5  
 
 
Risks 
 
Skin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in 
allergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (17-
22. The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito 
bite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a 
few minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. 
 
The drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks 
can occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may 
remain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally 
associated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur 
at the site of the venipuncture.   
 
The subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the 
skin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin 
prick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin 
prick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered 
according to the level and severity of reaction.  
 
5.  RECRUITING PROCEDURES 
 
Each clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for his or her 
location.  Suggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, 
and recruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also 
be sent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include 
examples of letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human 
subjects use committee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical 
investigator’s local human subjects use committee. 
 
6.  COMPENSATION 
 
A per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site 
should propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, 
supplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal 
preparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  
Compensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when 
allowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  The compensation amount is to be determined by 
and paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per subject 
cost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  Instructions for 
invoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are distributed to the clinical 
investigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without receipt of deliverables by 
FARRP. 
 6 
7.  INFORMED CONSENT FORMS 
 
Each clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to 
conform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use 
committee.   
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
This procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each 
clinical investigator.   
 
8.  MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
Each clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP Skin 
Reactivity to Fish Study-Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Skin Reactivity to 
Fish Study Data Sheet“ will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain 
subject names, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to 
FARRP.  At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln the questionnaire and the data sheet will 
be stored in a locked file in the Clinical Study Coordinators office.  Only the Clinical 
Study Coordinator and the Co-Directors of FARRP will have access to this information.  
In publications or reports using information collected from this work, the subjects will 
either be referred to as a collective or be identified by a subject number or other 
appropriate blinded designation.  Materials will be kept for 5 years after the completion 
of the study.  
 
9.  COPY OF QUESTIONNAIRE AND DATASHEETS   
 
Copies of the ““FARRP Skin Reactivity to Fish Study-Food Allergy Questionnaire” and 
the “FARRP Skin Reactivity to Fish Study Data Sheet” are included for submittal with 
clinical investigators’ proposal to their institute’s human subjects use committee. 
 
Funding  
This project is being funded by the Food Allergy Research & Resource Program of the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE USA.  If you require a letter indicating this, 
contact Julie A. Nordlee, FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator.   
 
Contract 
Each clinical investigator will be asked to sign a contract with FARRP and the University 
of Nebraska which will detail the deliverables to FARRP, the agreed upon per subject 
cost and details regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement between FARRP 
and the clinical investigator and their institution.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_10.pdf,"

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_9.pdf,"Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006

A. Introduction: 
 
Isinglass is prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the 
primary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for 
collagen preparations.  In the allergenicity assessment of novel proteins, pepsin digestion is one 
of the criteria used to evaluate their potential allergenicity (Taylor and Hefle, 2002).  Although 
isinglass is not a novel protein in human diets, its comparative resistance to pepsin digestion 
should be a useful measure of its potential allergenicity.  If rapidly hydrolyzed by pepsin, less 
likelihood exists that isinglass would sensitize susceptible individuals.  Sensitization to isinglass 
has not been reported, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines 
for many years.    This report describes the digestive stability of isinglass samples to pepsin in an 
identical approach used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins 
considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). 
 
B.  Materials and Methods: 
 
Test sample
 
Isinglass (lot number 1839) was provided obtained from A. B. Vickers, Burton-upon-Trent, U.K. 
by FARPP.  The isinglass sample (received in dry state) was dissolved in distilled water at a 
concentration of 5 mg/ml.  The isinglass solution remained slightly turbid.  Pre-incubation at 
lower pH (pH = 2) partially overcame this turbidity, but in order to make a fair comparison with 
other food proteins tested for digestibility, pre-incubation at low pH was not done.  Crude peanut 
extract (CPE) was prepared from ground peanut (Runner variety) as described previously 
(Koppelman et al., 2001).  
 
Pepsin
 
 
Pepsin was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), catalogue number P-6887.  This product 
was chosen because it has the highest specific activity commercially available (3300 U/mg for 
the particular batch), and because other researchers investigating the digestibility behavior of 
potentially allergenic proteins used this product as well (Thomas et al, 2004).  Pepsin was stored 
as a lyophilized powder, as supplied by the manufacturer, at – 20 C.  The ratio of 10 U of pepsin 
per ug of test protein was used throughout the study, according to Thomas et al. (2004).  Pepsin 
was dissolved immediately before the digestion experiment and used within 15 minutes in order 
prevent possible loss of activity due to auto-digestion.

Tubes containing 1.52 ml of simulated gastric fluid (SGS) were prepared.  SGF was used at pH 
1.2 (0.063 N HCl, containing 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin) and pH 2.0 (0.01 N HCl, 
containing 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin).  In a control experiment the potential effect of 
adding protein (pepsin, test proteins) on the final pH was tested, and found to be negligible (less 
than 0.05 pH points).   SGF was pre-warmed to 37 C for 5 minutes and 80 ul of 5 mg/ml 
isinglass was added at time point t = 0. For CPE, due to a lower solubility, SGF was prepared at 
a higher concentration such that the addition of 400 ul of 1 mg/ml CPE resulted in the same final 
concentration of HCl, NaCl, pepsin, and isinglass.  Samples of 200 ul were collected at time 
points: 0.5 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10, min, 20 min, 30 min and 60 min.  Samples were immediately 
stopped by mixing with 70 ul of 200 mM NaHCO
3 (pH = 11.0) and 70 ul of 5 times concentrated 
Laemmli electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli et al, 1970) containing 40% glycerol, 20% SDS, 5% 
b-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 M TRIS (pH 6.8) and 0.05% bromophenol blue.  The samples of 0.5 
min, 1 min, 2 min and 5 min were heated for 5 minutes at > 75 C directly after taking the sample 
of time point 5 min.  Samples of other time points were heated immediately after sampling.  All 
samples were stored at – 20 C until analysis by SDS-PAGE.  
 
The sample of time point t = 0 min was prepared by stopping and heating SGF prior to the 
addition of test protein.  After adding the isinglass, the samples were heated again to ensure full 
denaturation.  Pepsin auto-digestion was tested by adding 80 ul of water to SGF and incubation 
of 60 minutes as described for test proteins.  Protein stability at low pH was tested by preparing 
SGF without pepsin, and incubating the test protein for 60 minutes. 
 
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
 
 
SDS-PAGE was performed generally according to Laemmli (Laemmli, et al. 1970) with the 
MiniProtean system (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA) using 10-20% precast gels or with manually 
prepared 15% homogenous gels.  The molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen 
(Carlsbad, CA. USA, Mark12 catalogue number LC5677, ranging from 2.5 to 200 kD) and were 
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 ul per sample was loaded and 
electrophoresis was stopped just before the bromophenol blue-containing front reached the end 
of the gel.  
 
Two methods for gel staining were used. First, the novel Page-Blue method from Fermentas was 
used (Hanover, MD).  This method is said to be more sensitive compared to classical Coomassie 
staining method.  Gels were destained overnight. For the analyses of the peanut protein digestion 
(performed earlier), the classical method was used: gels were stained in 1% Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue R-250 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 50% methanol/20% acetic acid over night. 
Subsequently, gels were washed with 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 5 minutes and destained 
with 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 30 minutes.  After that, gels were further destained with 
25% methanol/10% acetic acid for 2 hours.

All gels were scanned with a regular laboratory scanner, and scans were not optimized in any 
way in order to allow an objective comparison. 
 
C. Results: 
 
Characterization of isinglass 
 
Undigested isinglass showed bands in the molecular weight range of 100-200 kD, but also three 
more distinct bands at approximately 25 kD, 45 kD, and 100 kD, and one vague band between 6 
and 14 kD (Figure 1).    
 
Digestibility of isinglass at pH 1.2
 
Upon incubation with pepsin at pH = 1.2, isinglass is digested rapidly.  The high molecular 
weight protein fraction was only visible at time points t = 0, 0.5 and 2 minutes. (Figure 2).  At 
time point 0.5 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible.  After 2 
minutes, no high molecular weight protein is observed.  At time points 0.5, 2, and 5 minutes, 
some intermediate molecular weight protein/peptide smear (range: 30 to 60 kD) is observed, but 
only vaguely.  This protein/peptide digestion product is completely further digested at later time 
points.  
 
Digestibility of isinglass at pH 2
 
Upon incubation with pepsin at a somewhat higher pH of 2, isinglass is digested rapidly, but 
some proteins/peptides remained for a longer time as compared to digestion at pH 1.2.  At time 
points 0.5 and 2 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible (Figure 3).  
This band disappeared after 5 minutes, somewhat later compared to the incubation at pH = 1.2.  
In the time span from 0.5 to 30 minutes, some intermediate weight protein/peptides were visible, 
and these disappeared after 30 minutes.  
 
 
Isinglass at both pH 1.2 and 2.0 appears to be labile in the absence of pepsin (Figure 2, 3). 
Pepsin auto-digestion experiments at pH = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 show that the pepsin band in SDS-
PAGE analysis is unaffected during the time course of the experiment (Figure 4), demonstrating 
that observed bands in the intermediate and low molecular weight areas after incubation with 
pepsin do not originate from pepsin. 
 
Digestibility of crude peanut extract - reference
 
Crude peanut extract (CPE) (Figure 5) is characterized by a typical band pattern showing Ara h 1 
(at approximately 63 kD as an intense, uniform band), Ara h 2 (a doublet at approximately 20 
kD), Ara h 3 (a triplet at 42-45 kD, and bands at 25 kD, and 14 kD), and Ara h 6 (a single, less 
intense band at approximately 15 kD), shown in Figure 5, left lane, arrows indicate the identified 
allergens).  Incubation with pepsin at both  pH  = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 shows that the majority of 
Ara h 1 disappears within 0.5 min, as well as the 42-45 kD bands of Ara h 3 (note that the 
remaining thick band at this height is pepsin).  In contrast, Ara h 2, in particular the heavy 
isoform remains stable for the time course of the experiment.  Ara h 6 also shows a high stability 
during the experiment, probably even more stable than Ara h 2.  Other bands in CPE are difficult Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 8 of 14 
  
to assign, especially during the time course of the digestion experiment where a series of 
peptides are generated as a results of degradation of the higher molecular weight proteins (Ara h 
1 mainly).  
 
D. Conclusions: 
 
Isinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, in a similar approach as used for assessing the 
digestibility of several allergens and also proteins considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 
2004).  Digestibility of peanut allergens was used as a reference. Compared to certain peanut 
allergens, isinglass is digested quickly.   
  
Limitations/speculation 
 
The nature of the intermediate bands is not known.  They may represent isinglass-derived 
peptides, or other fish proteins. The vague band between 6 and 14 kD may possibly represent 
parvalbumin, with a molecular weight of 12.3 kD, but from this investigation, there are no 
experimental data to support this.  However, all of the protein bands in isinglass are quickly 
digested by pepsin.

REPORT COD PARVALBUMIN ELISA
Date: August 19th of 2006
Author: Dr. M. Hessing
Signature:Parvalbumin ELISA 
The various samples received in July and August 2006 were extracted and analyzed using 
the sandwich ELISA for cod parvalbumin as described in the FARRP report (Dr. S. 
Hefle). Results are expressed in μg soluble parvalbumin/ g dry weight (ppm) based on 
the assumption that all soluble parvalbumin is extracted from the sample and 
demonstrates comparable immunoreactivity as cod parvalbumin. Results are shown in 
tables below.

In general, the various samples react limitedly. Dilutions were not parallel with dilutions 
of cod parvalbumin, and true quantification therefore is not possible. The non-parallelism 
is illustrated by the high SD’s (same order of magnitude as response), and by the 
increasing calculated value for higher diluted extracts (data not shown here). The non-
parallelism may be caused by differences in affinity of cod parvalbumin and parvalbumin 
of other fishes. Differences between the various samples are clearly visible. These may be 
explained by differences in parvalbumin content, but due to the issues mentioned above, 
this is not conclusive.PodiCeps BV

A. Introduction: 
 
Commercial monoclonal antibodies directed against frog and carp parvalbumin are available.  A 
commercial monoclonal antibody directed against frog parvalbumin has been used in one study 
as a screening tool in selecting a cDNA library for mackerel parvalbumin, and also was 
successfully used in the development of a mackerel parvalbumin ELISA (Hamada et al., 2003). 
Frog parvalbumin shares 43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species 
(according to a search of a database of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  
Carp parvalbumin has a rather high degree of sequence homology with cod parvalbumin so the 
use of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody might be even more promising for the detection of 
potentially allergenic fish parvalbumin.  Thus, an evaluation of the commercial anti-frog and 
anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies was conducted for applicability/efficacy in 
designing an ELISA for the detection of residual parvalbumin in isinglass.  Simultaneously (and 
as described in FARRP-08-2006), polyclonal antisera were produced against purified codfish 
parvalbumin and used in the development of an ELISA for detection of residual parvalbumin in 
isinglass.  
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for collagen 
preparations.  Fish collagen is not a major fish allergen but parvalbumin is widely considered as 
the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Although swim bladders are composed 
primarily of collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 
1989).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly 
investigated and certainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Sensitization to 
isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-sensitized 
individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  This 
observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
   
The anti-frog parvalbumin antibody was recently shown to detect parvalbumin found in the 
edible muscle tissues of cod, carp, catfish, and tilapia but not tuna (Chen et al., 2006).  The 
results demonstrating the ability of the anti-frog parvalbumin monoclonal antibody to detect fish 
parvalbumins will be shared herein because sufficient cross-reactivity may exist to allow 
detection of parvalbumin residues in commercial isinglass.  The anti-frog and anti-carp 
parvalbumin antibodies were evaluated for their ability to detect parvalbumin from various fish 
species in both ELISA and western blotting formats.   Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

University of Vienna, Austria.  
 
 C.  Methods: 
 
Protein extraction from fish tissue and isinglass 
 
Five grams of each fish sample were extracted with 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 
0.01M, pH 7.4), with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 tablet of Complete® EDTA-free protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).  Samples were blended in 50 mL of 
extraction buffer for 1 min using a Waring blender.  The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 x 
g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant solution was collected and stored at -20 °C until analysis.  
Isinglass samples were extracted by PBS at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) with continuous shaking 
overnight at 4 °C.  The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 x g for 30 min at 4°C and the 
supernatant was used as protein extract. 
 
Protein assay
 
The protein concentration of each extract was determined using a Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) as a standard. 
 
SDS polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
 
Fish extracts were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), containing 
2- mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent, and heated at 95 °C for five min. Ten µL of each fish 
extract (containing 10 µg protein) was loaded onto a Novex® tris-glycine 10-20% ready gel 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Five µL Precision Plus ProteinTM standards (Bio-Rad) were also 
used. Electrophoresis was carried out in a SureLockTM Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen).  
Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Invitrolon PVDF membranes using an 
Xcell II™ Blot Module (Invitrogen) for immunoblotting.  Transfer of proteins from the gel to 
each of the PVDF membranes was verified by staining the membranes with Ponceau S stain Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

(Sigma-Aldrich).  Additional gels were stained with Brilliant Blue G colloidal concentrate 
(Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  Images of freshly destained gels 
were captured and analyzed using a Kodak GL440 image station and 1D image analysis software 
(Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY).  
 
2D electrophoresis
  
Isoelectric focusing was performed on 7 cm nonlinear pH 3-10 Zoom® strips in a Zoom® 
IPGRunner™ system (Invitrogen).  The strips were rehydrated for 1 hr at room temperature in a 
solution consisting of 7 M urea, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1% pH 3-10 
ampholytes (Invitrogen) and 35 µg (for protein stain) or 3.5 µg (for immunoblotting)  fish protein 
extract.  Focusing conditions were controlled with a multi-step program: 200 V for 20 min, 450 
V for 15 min, 750 V for 15 min and 2000 V for 30 min. After focusing and prior to the second 
dimension, strips were equilibrated in a mixture of one mL NuPage® reducing agent 
(Invitrogen) and 9 mL 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min, then alkylated 
by incubation with 125 mM iodoacetamide in 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 
15 min.  The second dimension electrophoresis was conducted in a Novex® 4-20% Tris-Glycine 
Zoom® Gel (Invitrogen).  Completed gels were used for immunoblotting and protein stain.  The 
pI gradient of the Zoom® strips was calibrated by a low range pI isoelectric focusing calibration 
kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). 
 
Immunoblotting
 
Proteins separated in gels were transferred to PVDF membranes using an XCell II™ Blot 
Module (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  Following transfer, 
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS (PBS-NFDM) for two hours at room 
temperature and washed four times with PBS containing 0.5% v/v Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 
vigorous shaking.  The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-frog Mab 
(Parv-19) diluted 1:5,000 or anti-carp Mab (Swant 235) diluted 1:10,000 in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  
After four washes in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for one hour with goat anti-mouse 
IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), diluted 
1:5000 (v/v) in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  Membranes were washed four times with PBS-T and wetted 
in SuperSignal west Dura extended duration substrates (Pierce Biotechnology) to visualize the 
immunocomplex. The chemiluminescent signal was captured by exposing Kodak® BioMax light 
films for various times (Eastman Kodak Company).   
 
Competitive ELISA
 
A 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nagle Nunc international, Rochester, NY) was coated 
with 20µg protein/ml carp extract (100µl/well) overnight at 4˚C.  After coating, the free binding 
sites of the plate were blocked by 350µl/well 0.1% porcine gelatin in PBS for 2 hr at room 
temperature.  Serially diluted fish extracts, isinglass extracts, recombinant carp parvalbumin, 
PBS solution, or isinglass extracts spiked with a known amount of  recombinant carp 
parvalbumin were added to the blocked plate (50µl/well) as inhibitors followed by adding an 
equal volume of anti-carp Mab, diluted 1:15,000(v/v) in blocking buffer.  After incubation at 
37˚C for 1 hr, the plate was washed 4 times with PBS-T. Following washing, anti-mouse IgG -Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 8 of 21 
  
alkaline phosphatase conjugate, diluted 1:5000(v/v) in blocking buffer, was added to plate and 
incubated for 1 hr at 37˚C.  After washing, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and the 
color development was read at 410nm on a MRX microplate reader (Dynex technologies, 
Chantlly, VA).

Electrophoresis and immunoblots of fish protein extracts
 
 
1D electrophoresis and western blot
 
Initially, the protein profiles of cod, carp, catfish, tilapia, and tuna were assessed by SDS-PAGE, 
shown in Figure1.1A.  All five species showed similar protein banding patterns above a 
molecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular 
weights among fish species.  Either one or two distinct bands of high concentration were 
observed in the molecular weight range of 10-12 kDa expected for parvalbumins in carp (2), 
catfish (2), cod (1), and tilapia (2).  No significant bands were noted in the tuna sample below 25 
kDa.   
 
Immunoblots obtained using the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab are shown in Figure 1.1B.  All 
visible fish protein bands in the molecular weight range of 10-13 kDa were recognized by anti-
frog parvalbumin Mab.  The antibody did not bind to any bands in tuna (Figure 1.1B, lane 5).  
The molecular weight and relative abundance (determined by densitometry using the Kodak 
image analysis software) of the antibody-binding fish proteins is summarized in Table 1.1.  Lane 
6 of Figure1.1B contains recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01) with a molecular weight 
of 11.4 kDa (Swoboda, 2002). 
 
Immunoblots using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab failed to provide clear profile of antibody 
binding bands, which were masked by strong background.  In an effort to improve the 
background, several blocking reagents were tested in the immunoblotting, including non-fat dry 
milk, bovine serum albumin and porcine gelatin.  However, no immunoblot of satisfactory 
quality was obtained that is comparable to those using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  More 
optimization work is needed to reveal the binding pattern of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to fish 
proteins on immunoblots.

PAGE, shown in Figure1.2.  As with the previously evaluated 5 species and based on protein 
staining with Coomassie blue, these 6 species showed similar protein banding patterns above a 
molecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular 
weights among fish species.  Either one or two distinct bands of high concentration were 
observed in the molecular weight range of 10-13 kDa expected for parvalbumins.

Immunoblots using anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mab show both antibodies can detect 
parvalbumins from most of the fish species tested.  Little non-specific binding of the two 
antibodies to other proteins was observed.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher 
sensitivity than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab since similar signal intensities were achieved within 
shorter exposure time when anti-carp Mab was used.  As noted with the earlier studies of 5 
species, it should be noted that anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mab bind to parvalbumin 
from various fish species with different specificities.  Interestingly, the strongest binding 
apparently obtained for anti-frog parvalbumin Mab was with the parvalbumins from redfish and 
flounder.  These same two parvalbumins showed very low apparent binding to anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab.  Meanwhile, anti-carp parvalbumin Mab had high apparent specificity to 
parvalbumins from cod, cusk, hake and haddock, which exhibited weak apparent binding to anti-
frog parvalbumin Mab.  Both antibodies appear to bind well to pollock parvalbumin.

These additional results further suggest that anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin antibodies have 
some value in the detection of parvalbumin from the muscle tissues of a wide range of species.

Carp contained five isoforms that bound to the anti-frog parvalbumin antibody. Three of the five 
polypeptides had a molecular weight of 10.6 kDa and the other two were of 11.6 kDa. Their pI 
values ranged from 3.5-4.25, based on protein markers in the low range pI (Amersham 
Biosciences), data not shown.  Catfish had two fairly strong antibody-binding proteins at pI 4.25 
and a barely visible spot at pI 3.5.  Only one antibody-binding protein was observed in cod fish, 
with a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and pI 3.6.  Anti-frog parvalbumin antibody recognized two 
bands in tilapia.  Even though these two proteins showed similar intensity in SDS-PAGE (Figure 
1.3 D1), their antibody-binding capacities were markedly different (Figure 1.3 D2). The 11.1 
kDa protein with pI 3.6 exhibited much stronger binding than the 12.1 kDa subunit with pI 4.0.  
This suggested that the anti-frog pravlbumin Mab binds to different parvalbumin isoforms with 
different specificity.

Method development of competitive ELISA 
 
Figure 1.4 shows IgG binding inhibition curves of soluble carp and cod protein extracts that 
compete with bound carp protein on the ELISA plate using soluble anti-frog or anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab.  The inhibition curves of both carp and cod shifted to the left (the lower 
concerntration end) when anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (solid lines in Figure 1.4) was used instead 
of anti-frog parvalbumin Mab (dot lines in Figure 1.4).  This suggested that less soluble fish 
protein was needed to inhibit binding of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to solid-phased carp protein 
than when anti-frog parvalbumin Mab is used.  As a result, the competitive ELISA using anti-
carp parvalbumin Mab has higher sensitivity in detecting fish parvalbumins than when anti-frog 
parvalbumin Mab is used.  It should be noted that the competitive ELISA was not conducted by 
using more concentrated primary antibodies (1:5,000) than the optimized dilution (1:15,000) as 
described in methods section. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.4. Inhibition curves generated by soluble carp and cod protein extracts in competitive 
ELISA using anti-frog or anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (diluted 1:5,000) to bind to solid-phased 
carp protein. 
 
A competitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was developed to detect parvalbumin in 
fish and fish derived products due to the superior sensitivity of the anti-carp Mab compared to 
that of the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Using the amount of recombinant carp parvalbumin 
needed to obtain 20% inhibition as a detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of detecting 
0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin in a PBS extract (or 1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis). 
 
The competitive ELISA is developed to test fish parvalbumin in fish and fish derived products.  
Since the complex biochemical constituents in the extract of a matrix such as isinglass or fish 
gelatin might interfere with the assay, we wanted to evaluate the possibility that a high collagen Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 14 of 21 
  
content matrix might alter assay results.  Therefore, inhibition curves were obtained by serially 
diluting recombinant carp parvalbumin in PBS (no matrix effect) or in 10% (w/v) fish gelatin 
extract (Norland Products, Inc.), simulating fish protein matrix effects (Figure 1.5).  The fish 
collagen extract may contain an unknown amount of fish parvalbumin.  The results showed a 
dramatic difference in the slopes of the two inhibition curves, which suggested the standard 
curve generated in a PBS solution of recombinant carp parvalbumin was not suitable to evaluate 
parvalbumin content in the fish gelatin extract. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.5. Competitive ELISA detecting recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp c1.01) in PBS or 
fish collagen protein extract. 
 
It is possible to overcome the problem of matrix effect by spiking a known amount of 
recombinant carp parvalbumin into the sample protein extract and testing both spiked and 
unspiked samples in the same assay.  At least theoretically both spiked and non-spiked samples 
experience similar matrix effects and should exhibit parallel inhibition curves.  Figure 1.6 shows 
an example of competitive ELISA carried out on an isinglass sample.  In this case the sample 
was spiked with 20 µg recombinant carp parvalbumin per g sample and analyzed simulateously 
with an equivalent unspiked sample.  Based on the inhibition curves, a dilution representing 0.28 
mg dry weight of spiked sample and a dilution representing 1.57 mg of unspiked sample both 
exhibited 50% inhibition (contain equivalent amounts of parvalbumin).  Assuming the 
parvalbumin content in non-spiked sample is X µg/g, the amount of parvalbumin in both non-
spiked and spiked sample is 
1.57mg*X µg/g=0.28 mg *(X µg/g +20 µg/g) 
 
Solving the equation,  
X=4.3 µg/g Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 15 of 21 
  
Thus this specific sample of isinglass contains 4.3 ppm parvalbumin.  This example 
demonstrates that this assay can be used to measure the equivalent content of parvalbumin in 
isinglass samples or those of other similar matrices.

Analysis of Parvalbumin Content of Fish Tissues by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp 
Parvalbumin Mab 
 
Competitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was performed under optimized 
conditions to detect parvalbumins in various fish protein extracts and the results were showed in 
Figure 1.7.  Protein concentration of fish extracts that achieved 50% inhibition are calculated as 
1.8, 0.4, 2.8, 0.7 and 10 µg/mL for carp, catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna respectively, which is 
equivalent to 0.1  µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin.  If recombinant carp parvalbumin 
needed for 20% inhibition is defined as detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of 
detecting parvalbumin content equivalent to as low as 0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin. 
 
The inhibition curves of most fish extracts except catfish and cod exhibited similar slopes to that 
of recombinant carp parvalbumin.   It is not known if the slopes of catfish and cod were 
significant different from the others.  The slope differences can be explained by the existence of 
differing specificities for the antibody binding to the epitopes of catfish or cod parvalbumin. 
Nevertheless, the matrix effect of fish extracts may also introduce slope variation.   
 
Carp extract containing 1.8 µg/mL total proteins exhibited inhibition equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL 
recombinant carp parvalbumin.  That is, the abundance of parvalbumin in carp extract is 
0.1/1.8=5.5%.  Similarly, parvalbumin abundances of catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna in protein Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 16 of 21 
  
extracts were estimated at 25, 3.6, 14.3 and 1% respectively.  These numbers are different from 
the abundance results calculated by SDS-PAGE densitometry shown in Table 1.1, which 
suggested the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab binds to fish parvalbumin from various fish species 
with different specificity.   It is interesting to observe detectable parvalbumin in tuna extract that 
is not visible in either SDS-PAGE or westernblot using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab may have higher specificity for tuna parvalbumin than anti-frog antibody.

Analysis of Parvalbumin Content of Isinglass by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp 
Parvalbumin Mab 
 
The competitive ELISA method described above using anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal 
antibody was used to assess the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Initially,  nine samples of 
isinglass produced from the maws of seven different species of fish were analyzed as shown in 
Table 1.2.  These isinglass samples were manufactured in typical fashion with milling but no 
further processing steps; thus these would be considered as unprocessed fish maws.  A low, but 
variable, level of residual parvalbumin was found in isinglass from all of the fish species.  Based 
on the comparatively higher level of residual parvalbumin found in the isinglass manufactured 
from the Nile perch maws, this species of fish was eliminated as a source of maws for the 
production of isinglass.   
 
Since parvalbumin is a water-soluble protein that binds calcium, washing was introduced as a 
commercial unit operation in an attempt to decrease residual parvalbumin levels.  Normally, 
unprocessed maws would be washed with water.  Thus, the “before treatment” column in Table

phosphate buffer wash.  Based on limited experiments, the determination was made that the 
phosphate buffer wash was perhaps the most effective in reducing parvalbumin levels.  
Somewhat variable results were obtained for isinglass produced from maws of various fish 
species but the phosphate buffer wash appeared to be effective.  This experiment was not 
repeated.  The sources of the fish swim bladders used to produce these samples of isinglass are 
representative of the range of species used in the commercial production of isinglass. 
 
Table 1.4 shows the parvalbumin content of some commercial isinglass samples provided by the 
isinglass manufacturers.  These samples were selected after the elimination of Nile perch as a 
commercial source of maws and after development of the phosphate buffer washing operation.  
The sample codes can be matched to the descriptions provided in Table 1.3.  It should be noted 
that, for some unknown reason, the results of this batch of assay were apparently lower than 
what we tested previously.  The reference isinglass sample was tested on this occasion as usual 
and it yielded a result of 1.8 µg/g, much less than previous results (4.6-5.0 µg/g); the earlier, 
higher level was confirmed on numerous occasions.  Some potential assay problems, such as 
poor protein extraction, degradation of coating protein or anti-parvalbumin antibody, have been 
excluded as possible causes of the lower than expected results.

Parvalbumins share considerable sequence homology among fishes.  Frog parvalbumin shares 
43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species (according to a search of a 
database of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  Anti-frog and anti-carp 
parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding to the parvalbumins in fish muscle 
tissues from several divergent fish species (Chen et al., 2006).  We were unable to obtain fish 
muscle tissues from the species of fish used to manufacture isinglass but these results suggest 
that parvalbumin is present in the muscle tissues of most, if not all, fish species.  Of course, 
swim bladders rather than muscle tissues are used as the raw material for preparation of 
isinglass.  However, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).   
 
While anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mabs detect the presence of parvalbumin in muscle 
tissues from the muscle tissues of all fish species tested in this study, parvalbumin from various 
fish species show differences in specificity to each of these antibodies.  Anti-frog parvalbumin 
Mab appears to be most useful for detecting parvalbumin from flounder, pollock and redfish 
compared to the other species tested.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher specifity for 
carp, cod, cusk, hake, haddock and pollock parvalbumins than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab, 
however, it displayed much weaker binding to parvalbumins from flounder and redfish.  In 2-
dimensional electrophoresis with immunoblotting only, the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was able 
to detect parvalbumin from tuna.   
 
These electrophoresis and immunoblotting results demonstrate convincingly that commercial 
anti-parvalbumin antibodies are able to detect the presence of parvalbumin in a range of fish 
species.  Certainly, the quantitative reliability of an ELISA based upon either of these antibodies 
may be dependent upon the species origin of the fish-based ingredient that is being evaluated.  
However, even though isinglass is made from species of fish that were not evaluated here, a 
sufficient number of species were evaluated to indicate that these antibodies should have some 
utility in the detection of parvalbumin residues in isinglass. 
 
The anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was employed for the development of a parvalbumin ELISA.  
Because sequence homology was greater between other fish parvalbumin and carp parvalbumin 
compared to frog parvalbumin, the choice of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was considered as 
advantageous.  The inhibition curves presented in Figure 1.4 also indicate that the anti-carp 
parvalbumin MAb was the superior choice.  While a successful ELISA method was developed, 
its quantitative accuracy for detecting residual parvalbumin from species other than carp is 
undoubtedly compromised to some degree by the variability in binding specificity discussed 
above.     
 
Residual parvalbumin was detected in samples of commercial isinglass using the competitive 
ELISA method with anti-carp parvalbumin Mab.  Obviously, some caution is warranted in the 
interpretation of these results because of the previously discussed differences in binding 
specificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab with parvalbumins from the various fish species.  
The anti-carp parvalbumin Mab is reasonably good at detecting parvalbumins from cod, cusk, 
hake, pollock, haddock, carp, catfish, and tilapia based upon the binding specificity.  This Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

demonstrates that this antibody has reasonably broad specificity.  The rather low level of 
sensitivity (1 µg/g or 1 ppm) of the ELISA also suggests that the method would detect 
parvalbumin residues in spite of the differences in binding specificities.  However, since this 
ELISA has not been applied to samples of the fish used in the manufacture of isinglass, we 
cannot categorically indicate that it would detect parvalbumin from those species.  Furthermore, 
the quantitative accuracy of this method cannot easily be substantiated.  However, its value in 
comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various approaches to the possible reduction of 
residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass would seem to be quite excellent. 
 
Since the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish contains parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), a 
reasonable assumption would be that the swim bladders of the fish used in the manufacture of 
isinglass would also contain parvalbumin.  The nature of the collagen matrix and the known 
effectiveness of isinglass in removal of protein haze components of beers and ales suggest that 
isinglass might well bind parvalbumin.  The discovery of residual parvalbumin in isinglass 
indicates that this is the case.  Since parvalbumin is water-soluble, the expectation would be that 
the parvalbumin could be removed from isinglass by incorporation of washing steps in the 
manufacturing process.  In fact, washing with phosphate buffer is apparently effective in 
reduction of residual parvalbumin levels.  However, parvalbumin cannot be entirely eliminated 
from isinglass by washing.  Although this ELISA seems to provide reasonable proof that residual 
parvalbumin is present at rather low levels in isinglass, development of an ELISA based upon 
anti-cod parvalbumin was also pursued. 
 
The levels of residual isinglass found in commercial isinglass using the anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal Ab ELISA are very low (1-5 ppm).  Since isinglass is very insoluble and used as a 
clarifying agent for beers and ales, the majority of any isinglass added to these beverages would 
be removed by precipitation, filtration, centrifugation or other means.  In all likelihood, much of 
the residual isinglass would also likely be removed.  Clearly, addition of isinglass to these 
beverages could result in the incorporation of extremely low levels of parvalbumin into these 
beverages.  Clinical challenges trials on the allergenicity of isinglass are needed to determine if 
the low levels of parvalbumin present in isinglass represent any risk whatsoever to fish-allergic 
individuals.

 Detection of fish parvalbumin in beer tank sediment (containing 
isinglass) by inhibition ELISA 
Lingyun Chen, 07-26-05 
 
Materials  
Sediment of beer tank from AB Vickers, received on 7/21/2005. 
Monoclonal mouse anti-carp parvalbumin antibody: Swant 235 
Recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01): provided by Dr. Ines Swoboda. 
 
Methods: 
• Protein extraction:   
The beer tank sediment sample was centrifuged at 15,000 xg for 5 min and the 
supernatant was collected as crude extract.    
 
• Spiking rCyp C1.01 into protein extract:  
Add 5ul 220μg/ml rCyp C1.01 into 995 μL extract. 
 
• Inhibition ELISA:    
Inhibition ELISA was set up based on FARRP ELISA protocols with 
modification. The procedure is briefly outlined as following: 
1. The microplates were coated with 20 μg/mL carp protein extract (100 μL/well) 
overnight at 4ºC; 
2. Blocking the wells with 350 μL of blocking buffer (0.1% porcine gelatin PBS) at 
room temperature for 2 hours; 
3. Adding 50 μL inhibitors (spiked or non-spiked extract, 2 fold serial dilution in PBS) 
and then 50 μL anti-carp antibody (dilution 1:15,000 in blocking buffer) to each 
well, incubate at 37ºC  for 1 hour; 
4. ELISA washing; 
5. Adding 100 μL /well secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG AP conjugated, 
Pierce 31323, diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer), incubate at 37ºC for 1 hour; 
6. ELISA washing; 
7. Adding ρ-NPP substrate 100 μL/well, incubate at room temperature for 30min; 
8. Stopping by adding 100 μL/well 1N NaOH and reading at 410nm. 
 
Results: 
 
• Inhibition ELISA 
Inhibition curves are shown in Fig 1 for unspiked and spiked beer sediment 
extracts. The level of rCyp C1.01 spiked in the extract was 1.1 μg/mL isinglass.  
Assuming the non-spiked extract contains X μg/mL parvalbumin, the spiked sample 
contains (X+1.1) μg/mL parvalbumin. Based on the inhibition curve, 0.025 mL unspiked 
extract (the second point from right end of the unspiked curve) and 0.0025 mL spiked 
extract exhibited similar inhibition.  Therefore, 0.025 mL unspiked extract and 0.0025 
mL spiked extract contained equal amount of parvalbumin.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine.

A. Introduction 
 
All codfish-allergic individuals are reported to have IgE antibodies specific to Gad c 1, a 
parvalbumin, the first purified and characterized fish allergen (Elsayed and Bennich, 1975; 
Taylor et al., 2004). Parvalbumins are a group of highly related calcium binding proteins that are 
apparently important in regulating calcium flux in vertebrates.  Parvalbumins have also been 
identified as the major allergens in other fish species including salmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel 
(Tra j 1), bigeye tuna (Thu o 1), carp (Cyp c 1) and several species of mackerels (Sco j 1, Sco a 
1, and Sco s 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 2000; Van Do et al., 1999; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Hamada et al., 2003).  Thus, parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen in 
fish (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 1997).  Parvalbumin is 
also the major allergen of frog and the sequence of frog parvalbumin has been determined 
(Hilger et al., 2002; cross-reactivity exists between fish and frog parvalbumins (Hilger et al., 
2004).  Based on these studies it is clear that most vertebrates have at least two genes that encode 
highly identical forms of parvalbumin, that are classified primarily by pI values as alpha-
parvalbumins (pI ~ 5.0 or greater) and beta-parvalbumins (pI ~ 4.5 or less), and with sequences 
that align more closely within the two lineages (Swoboda et al., 2002).  However, it is not clear 
that definition based on pI value alone is meaningful.  Although mammals also have 
parvalbumins, they have not been reported as allergens.  While many of the parvalbumin 
sequences that have been reported as allergens appear to be of the beta-lineage by sequence 
alignment it is important to recognize that various fish species have between two and five 
parvalbumin proteins (Pechere et al., 1971; Giriga and Rehbein, 1988; Chen et al., 2006).   
Because we were interested in detecting the major allergenic protein from a variety of fish 
species it is important to evaluate species and isoform differences of the parvalbumins.  
Therefore we performed bioinformatics analyses to compare available sequences from 
commonly consumed fish parvalbumins in order to understand the structural and sequential 
similarity of these proteins.  This analysis will assist in the evaluation of the use of various 
antibodies such as anti-frog parvalbumin, anti-carp parvalbumin, and anti-cod parvalbumin in 
the detection of parvalbumins from a range of fish species. 
 
 
B. Methods 
 
Parvalbumin sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(www.ncbi.nih.gov).  A clustal W alignment was performed using DNASTAR with 
representative parvalbumins from a number of important species of fish: carp, cod, mackerel, 
perch, pike, pollack, salmon, silver hake, whiting and toadfish swimbladder.  If two or more Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 6 of 12 
  
sequences were available for a given species, the most divergent were compared.  Results are 
presented as multiple sequence alignment, a percent identity and sequence divergence table and a 
phylogenetic tree (Figures 2.1-2.3).  In addition, a multiple sequence alignment to carp 
parvalbumin sequence GI# 17977825 was performed (Fig. 2.4) with another carp, three cod, one 
catfish, two frog parvalbumins and those of rat and bovine using the Align program (Scientific 
and Educational Software, Cary, NC), which uses a PAM250 scoring matrix with a mismatch 
penalty of 2, gap penalty of 4 and gap extension penalty of 1 (Chen et al., 2006).  The pI value 
for each sequence was calculated using Protean protein structure prediction and annotation 
software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).     
 
C. Results & Discussion 
 
The results are summarized graphically in Figures 2.1-2.4. 
 
Note that the sequences around the two calcium binding pockets are the most conserved, as 
expected (Fig. 2.1).  It is not clear whether IgE from most individuals with allergy to fish 
parvalbumin bind at the Ca+ binding region, though there are data that indicate the removal of 
calcium reduces IgE binding for at least some allergic subjects (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998; 
Swoboda et al., 2002).  As aligned here, parvalbumin from the other fish are between 56 and 
91% identical to those of the three cod fish parvalbumin species (Fig. 2.2), which are themselves 
only 63 to 74% identical.  These high levels of sequence identity indicate a high likelihood of 
IgE cross-reactivity for at least some allergic subjects (Aalberse, 2000).  The studies by 
Bugajska-Schretter et al. (1998) and Swoboda et al. (2002) have also provided evidence that 
many individuals bind to parvalbumin from a number of these species including: carp, cod, eel, 
perch, salmon and tuna.  Cross-species inhibition has also demonstrated that pre-incubating sera 
of a number of fish allergic individuals with an extract of codfish significantly diminished or 
abolished IgE binding to carp, eel, perch, salmon and tuna demonstrating shared IgE binding 
(Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998).   
 
The parvalbumin family of calcium binding proteins has diverged through evolutionary history, 
but the overall structure and the sequences are remarkably conserved across broad taxonomic 
groups.  An interesting finding is that many fish species have two or more “types” of 
parvalbumins that either represent, alpha- and beta-parvalbumins or functionally different beta-
isoforms that appear to be more conserved across species than across types, within a given taxa 
(Fig. 2.3).  For instance, one parvalbumin from salmon aligns better with pike than it does to the 
other salmon parvalbumin, which is closer to a parvalbumin from pollack.  However, these fish 
proteins are all more similar to each other than to the mammalian and amphibian alpha-
parvalbumins that are known and appear to be less allergenic (or alternatively more tolerogenic 
than the fish parvalbumins.  The biological significance of the two types of parvalumins is not 
understood (Swoboda et al., 2002).    
 
Together this information demonstrating the close sequence similarity across species of fish 
suggests that one or two parvalbumins may function well as diagnostic reagents (skin test Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 7 of 12 
  
reagents or IgE binding targets) for most individuals with fish allergy.  Conversely, antibodies to 
one or two of these fish parvalbumins could serve as reagents for detection of muscle tissue from 
a wide range of fish species.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_5.pdf,"Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

 I.  Purification of Codfish Parvalbumin 
 
 Lead Scientist:  Aard de Jong., Ph.D., TNO, The Netherlands 
 
A. Introduction: 
 
Since isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major allergen from 
fish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around the possible 
presence of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major allergen in several different 
species of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and tuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; 
Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et 
al., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999 ) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals 
with fish allergy (Taylor et al., 2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the fish species 
used in the manufacturing of isinglass have not been examined.  However, because parvalbumin 
is present at some level in the majority of fish that have been investigated (Chen et al., 2006; 
Taylor et al., 2004), the assumption that parvalbumin is present in the fish species used to 
manufacture isinglass seems reasonable.  Furthermore, although parvalbumin is primarily found 
in fish muscle while isinglass is manufactured from swim bladders, parvalbumin has been 
identified in the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish (Gerday et al., 1989).  Again, it seems 
prudent to assume that the swim bladders of the fish species used to manufacture isinglass also 
contain parvalbumin.  Thus, the detection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass 
seems to be a key factor in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material.  Because 
cod parvalbumin is the best characterized of the fish allergens, the development of an ELISA for 
parvalbumin was pursued with the hypothesis that this ELISA would also detect any residual 
parvalbumin in isinglass emanating from the swim bladders used in its manufacture. 
 
The development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA required several steps.  This first step was the 
purification of cod parvalbumin.  This portion of the research effort was sub-contracted to TNO 
in the Netherlands to a group headed by Aard de Jong., Ph.D.  This group succeeded in the 
purification of gram amounts of cod parvalbumin.  Their report can be found as Appendix A. 
 
II.  Production of Anti-Cod Parvalbumin Polyclonal Antibodies 
 
 Lead Scientist:  Sue L. Hefle, Ph.D., FARRP, University of Nebraska 
 
A. Introduction: 
 
Once purified cod parvalbumin was obtained (see Section IV), the production of antibodies was 
needed as the next step in the development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA.  The approach involved 
the production of polyclonal antibodies against cod parvalbumin in rabbits.  While the earlier 
ELISA efforts had involved use of commercial monoclonal antibodies against frog and carp 
parvalbumins (see FARRP-07-2006), the production of polyclonal antisera was selected in hopes 
that the specificity of the antibodies would be broader allowing more consistent detection of Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

parvalbumins from various fish species and the swim bladders of the species used to produce 
isinglass. 
 
 
 B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Purified cod parvalbumin was obtained from TNO Food Research Institute (Zeist, the 
Netherlands, see Section I and Appendix A).  Antibodies were produced at Covance 
Laboratories (Denver, PA, USA).  Three New Zealand female rabbits were injected with the 
purified cod parvalbumin using a standard immunization protocol (Harlow and Lane, 1988) and 
TiterMax adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).  Initial injections were 200 µg 
parvalbumin per rabbit intradermally, and booster injections were 100 µg subcutaneously every 
four weeks.  Blood serum was collected every three weeks and tested for response using a non-
competitive ELISA.  As of the second booster injection, titers (defined as the log reciprocal of 
the mid-linear portion of the titration curve) reached more than 10,000 in all rabbits.  A pool of 
two production bleeds from each rabbit (pool titer 100,000) was sent to Drs. Stef Koppelman 
(AllerTeQ) and Martin Hessing (Podiceps) for use in developing ELISAs for the detection of 
parvalbumin. 
 
 C.  Results & Discussion:  
 
High-titer polyclonal antisera against cod parvalbumin was obtained from the immunized 
rabbits.  This antisera was used to develop the cod parvalbumin ELISA (see Section III).

A. Introduction: 
 
Although it is widely recognized that parvalbumin is a pan-allergen from fish muscle tissues and 
the major allergen for fish-allergic individuals, no documentation exists to demonstrate the 
presence of parvalbumin in either fish flesh or fish maws from the species of fish used to 
manufacture isinglass.  This report describes the procurement of fish and fish maws from these 
species of fish and the preparation of extracts from those samples.  In the following phase of the 
investigations, an ELISA for the detection of cod parvalbumin was developed and used to assess Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

the parvalbumin content of these extracts.  In this section of the report, the extracts were 
analyzed for protein concentration and SDS-PAGE band pattern.  The extraction studies resulted 
in the selection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the preparation of the extracts on a larger 
scale.  
 
 
 B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Fish samples
 
Whole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers 
used by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 
whole fish).  The fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-like 
tissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was discarded.  In 
this report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1) and the description 
maw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.

All maw samples arrived in dried condition.  The processing background of these samples was 
unknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and 
covered with mold.  Samples of maw and fish (after fillets were prepared) were stored until use 
at -20° C.

Extraction buffers 
Water, PBS and 0.9% salt solution were used to prepare extracts.  Although water and 0.9% salt 
solution are not buffers, the set of these extraction fluids are referred to as extraction buffers 
(water, PBS, 0.9% NaCl).  All three extraction buffers were sterile and pyrogen free solutions. 
PBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue number N400500) and contained per 
liter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na
2HPO4·2H2Oand , 0.3 g NaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  Water and 0.9% 
NaCl were from Fresenius Kabi as well (catalogue numbers B230667 and 2660091, 
respectively).  Containers with extraction buffer were only used once after opening.  
 
Protein concentration determination
 
Bradford analysis was used, applying Bradford reagent from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, 
catalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Sigma: A7906, 
minimum BSA content: 98%) 
 
SDS-PAGE 
 
SDS-PAGE was performed with a ready-to-use electrophoresis system equipped with 4-20% 
gradient gels (precast, Mercury PerfectPAGE SDS, catalogue number 5300.41212, Continental 
Lab Products, San Diego, CA, USA) under standard conditions.  Markers were from BioRad 
(Hercules, CA, USA, product name: Precision Plus Protein Standards). Laemmli sample buffer 
was from Biorad (catalogue number 161.0737) and 1:20 (V:V) β-mercaptoethanol (MP 
Biomedicals Inc., Uden, the Netherlands, catalogue number 194834) was added prior to use.  
Gels were stained with Coomassie Briljant Blue (Acros Organics, Landsmeer, the Netherlands, 
catalogue number 191490250, 0.1% in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol), and destained with 
10% acetic acid and 40% methanol.  Gels were scanned with a HP Photosmart 3110 scanner, 
using HP Solution Center software. 
  
A reference sample of purified parvalbumin obtained from FARRP and its preparation has been 
described in Section I of this report. 
 
General extraction procedure
 
Fish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a 
professional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-
mix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared 
by stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of extraction buffer for 2 hours at 
room temperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml 
PP-test tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  
For exploratory extracts, supernatants were taken and analyzed directely.  Production extracts 
were filtered over 0.22 µm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES (polyethersulfone) 
sterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic (Corning Inc., Acton, MA, USA). 
After filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml polypropylene cryo vials, 
12,5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner bio-one catalogue number 
121263).  Filtration and subdividing was done in a flow chamber.

 C.  Results & Discussion:  
 
Comparison of extraction buffers – SDS-PAGE results 
Three extraction buffers with neutral pH, with or without physiological concentration of salt, 
were used to investigate the extractability of protein from fish flesh and maw samples. In order 
to test the protein composition in a qualitative way, SDS-PAGE analysis was performed for all 
extracts.  Figure 3.1 and 3.2 (panels distributed over different pages) show the results for fish 
flesh and maws respectively.

Figure 3.2. SDS-PAGE results of maw extracts 
Samples J52/04 and FL17/18/05 (Panel A, previous page), samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 (Panel B, previous 
page), and samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 (Panel C, this page) were extracted with different extraction fluids and 
analyzed on SDS-PAGE (4-20% gels stained with Coomassie Briliant Blue).  Molecular weights of markers are 
indicated next the marker lanes (kDa). 
 
 
All fish flesh samples (Figure 3.1), except F 21/05 show a band pattern very similar to each other 
and very similar to that of cod fish, (sample from a local supermarket).  A triplet between 
approximately 37 and 50 kDa is clearly visible, as well as bands at approximately 60 and 100 
kDa.  A faint triplet at approximately 30 kDa is visible in all samples (except for F 21/05) as 
well.  Also, a band at approximately 12 kDa is clearly visible in all fish samples, including F 
21/05.  This band is most likely parvalbumin (based on MW and band assignment described in 
the relevant literature.  The staining of the gel depicted in Figure 3.1A is less clear, for unknown 
reason, and the parvalbumin is therefore less clearly visible.  The control sample of cod fish on 
this gel shows the same phenomenon, indicating the that this is indeed a gel (staining) artifact, 
rather than a difference in band pattern as compared to the other fish samples investigated 
(Figures 1B and 1C).  It should be noted that the fish sample F 21/05 arrived in a non-frozen 
condition at PodiCeps premises, covered with mold.  Although the fish flesh was prepared as 
best as possible under these conditions, the different SDS-PAGE pattern may well be explained 
by this.  
 
Water, PBS, and 0.9% NaCl gave similar results for extracts of fish flesh (similar band pattern, 
similar band intensity).  Extracts prepared with SDS-PAGE sample buffer showed more intense 
bands.

For maws, quite another picture emerges.  As shown in Figure 2 (panels A, B, and C), all 
samples of maws have a band pattern different to that of cod flesh which was used as a control.  
A set of bands at approximately 150 kDa, and a (sometimes) vague band at around 50 kDa is 
present in all maw samples.  There are some individual differences as well.  For example, 
samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 show protein bands at approximately 20 kDa.  
 
A noteworthy difference occurred in maw extracts prepared with salt versus without salt.  The 
overall intensity of proteins bands was higher for all maw samples (except for FL 17/18/05) in 
extracts prepared with physiological salt concentration.  More specifically, the protein band at 
approximately 150 kDa was not present or was barely visible in extracts prepared without salt. 
There are some additional differences between extracts with or without salt, varying for each 
species.  When SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used for extraction, the overall intensity of 
staining was much higher.  Furthermore, an additional band at approximately 20 kDa was found 
in all samples.  Sample J52/04 had the lowest intensity of this band.  It is unlikely that this band 
is parvalbumin for two reasons.  First, the molecular weight is different.  Second, parvalbumin is 
water/salt extractable by definition.  It cannot be excluded, though, that parvalbumin is present in 
the maw extracts based on this SDS-PAGE analysis even though no noteworthy bands were 
visible in the 12kDa region. 
 
Qualitative analysis (Bradford)
 
The protein concentration of all fish flesh and fish maw extracts was determined using Bradford 
analysis (Table 3.2).

For fish flesh extracts, minor differences in protein concentration were found between the 
various extraction buffers.  Only sample F 21/05 shows a substantially lower protein 
concentration.  This is the sample that arrived at Podiceps in non-frozen, mold covered Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

condition. For the other samples,  the protein concentration ranges from approximately 2.2 to 4.4 
mg/ml. More noteworthy differences in protein concentrations were found for extracts made 
from the flesh of the different fish species.  
 
For fish maw extracts, lower protein concentrations were found.  Differences in protein 
concentration were found in comparisons between the different extraction buffers.  Differences 
were also noted in the protein concentrations prepared from maws of different species.  In fact, 
extracts prepared in the absence of physiological concentrations of salt show a much lower 
protein concentration as compared to extracts prepared with salt.  These data are in line with the 
results of the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2A, B, and C).  
 
Selection of extraction buffer
 
The choice of extraction buffer (water, 0.9% NaCl, and PBS) had little effect on the protein band 
pattern encountered with SDS-PAGE and the protein yield as determined by the Bradford assay 
for fish flesh.  However, for the maw extracts, a substantially higher yield and a richer band 
pattern was obtained when extracts were prepared in the presence of physiological 
concentrations of salt.  
 
SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used to prepare extracts as controls.  Due to the presence of the 
detergent SDS and the reducing agent DTT, protein extraction becomes more efficient, resulting 
in higher yields and additional proteins that get solubilized.  However, the nature of this buffer 
makes it not suitable for the skin testing aspects of this investigation (results not yet available). 
 
The decision was made to select PBS as the extraction buffer and to exclude fish sample F 21/05 
from production of skin test extracts.  The production of skin test extracts will be described later 
in conjuction with the results of the skin test trials. 
 
The extracts described in this section of the report were subsequently used with the cod 
parvalbumin ELISA to assess the parvalbumin content of the fish flesh and maw samples used in 
the manufacturing of isinglass (see Section V below).

A. Introduction: 
Western blotting of the rabbit anti-codfish parvalbumin antibody against fish flesh and maws 
was carried out in order to ascertain which band(s) in fish flesh and maws would be recognized 
by the antisera. 
 Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 15 of 28 
  
B. Materials and Methods: 
 
SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by electroblotting according 
to the method of Towbin et al. (1979). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with 
affinity purified anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies. Bound anti-cod parvalbumin IgG was detected 
with peroxidase-labelled goat-anti-rabbit-IgG antibodies using the DAB staining method.  
  
 C.  Results & Discussion: 
The Westen blot indicates that all fish muscle extracts reacted with affinity-purified antibodies 
against cod parvalbumin, with some differences in reactivity (Figure 4, upper panel).  Maws 
were analyzed as well (Figure 4, lower panel).  In maws, the parvalbumin was only vaguely 
visible for F21/05 and other extracts did not show any reacting parvalbumin.  While parvalbumin 
seems present in fish muscle on the basis of Western blots, parvalbumin was not detected using 
the same antibodies in the ELISA (see following section).  This may be explained by the fact that 
epitopes are under native condition in the ELISA and not as readily accessible to the anti-
parvalbumin antibodies.

V. ELISA for Detecting Cod Parvalbumin  
 
 Lead Scientists:  Stef J. Koppelman, Ph.D., AllerTeQ, The Netherlands

A.  Introduction: 
 
With the production of purified cod parvalbumin (see Section I) and anti-cod parvalbumin 
antisera (see Section II), the development of an ELISA for cod parvalbumin was possible.  
Although the existing ELISAs using anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies 
seemed reasonably good, the cod parvalbumin ELISA was developed because an ELISA based 
upon polyclonal antisera might have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider 
range of species. 
 
B. Methods & Materials 
 
Inhibition ELISA
 
An indirect ELISA utilizing the rabbit anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies was initially developed. 
The antibodies were purified using Protein G (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) before 
use. Using the indirect ELISA in a quantitative determination, a cod extract was analyzed for cod 
parvalbumin content. The extract contained 0.3 ± 0.2 mg/ml cod parvalbumin, in line with an 
average protein concentration of 2-3 mg/ml. However, further development and testing of the 
inhibition ELISA was abrogated because it was found that a sandwich-type format ELISA was 
more suitable for quantification of analyte concentrations close to the detection limit. 
 
Sandwich ELISA
 
All sandwich ELISA experiments were performed with a capture antibody of Protein G-purified 
rabbit anti-parvalbumin antibody (1 µg/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified rabbit 
anti-parvalbumin antibody (500 fold diluted) as the detector antibody. Blocking of remaining 
sites on the microtiter plate was done with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) 
containing 3% BSA. The incubation buffer was PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20 
and the washing buffer consisted of PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20.

Specificity of the Cod Parvalbumin ELISA
 
The substances shown in Table 5.1 were used for cross-reactivity testing. Samples were from a 
Dutch supermarket except for peanut, corn, soy flour and wheat flour which were obtained from 
food ingredient suppliers. Extracts were made by mixing 1 part of (ground, if necessary) sample 
plus 5 parts of extraction buffer (PBS) for two hours at room temperature, then clarified using 
centrifugation (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm).

Figure 5.1 shows the reactivity of the tested samples, at different dilutions starting at  
10-fold up to 21,870-fold (measured in duplicate). In each experiment a standard curve of 
parvalbumin was measured in triplicate. Background signals were between 0.09 and 0.14. 
Background signals were not subtracted from measured signals in the presented figures. The 
maximal signals at plateau varied between approximately 1.2 and 2.3, due to some variability in

The data from Figure 5.1 show that the cross-reactivity of all tested samples is low, even at low 
dilutions. Shrimp is the most reactive substance, at a dilution of 30 fold. The measured response 
is comparable of a dilution of 312,500-fold of cod, so in the order of 10,000 fold less.  
 
Recovery of Cod Parvalbumin from Isinglass
 
Beer, wine, fish gelatin, and isinglass were spiked with purified cod parvalbumin by diluting a 
calibration curve in a 10-fold diluted matrix extract. Figure 3.2 shows the results. The plateau 
heights differ per experiment due to variations in substrate color reaction.

The data in Figure 5.2 show that isinglass does not inhibit the reactivity of parvalbumin in the 
sandwich ELISA substantially. Therefore, traces of potentially present parvalbumin should not 
be hindered from recognition by the matrix.  The matrix with most interference is isinglass.  At 
half-maximal reactivity (absorbance approximately 0.35), the difference in reactivity of 
parvalbumin in a 10-fold diluted isinglass extract is estimated to be 2 to 4-fold.  This should be 
considered when measuring the parvalbmin content in samples of isinglass that are diluted only 
10-fold.

Extracts of fish and maw samples were prepared and tested in several dilutions in duplicate.

The majority of the samples did not react substantially.  In the fish extracts, parvalbumin was 
present based on SDS-PAGE patterns and immunoblotting with anti-cod parvalbumin antisera  .  
It was expected that the fish samples would be more reactive than the maw samples, but the 
contrary was observed.  Maw samples F21/05 and FL13/04 were most reactive. For F21/05 there 
was no usable fish extract (sample arrived moldy), and fish extract FL13/04 shows a lower 
response than maw sample FL13/04.  Of the fish samples, FA 13/05 is most reactive; again no 
dose dependence is observed and the maximum signal is far lower than that of purified 
parvalbumin. 
 
Even although the data show that the tested samples do not react substantially, data from Figure 
3.2 were calculated using the calibration curve of purified cod parvalbumin. Limit of 
quantification is 0.2 ug/g (ppm). Table 5.2 shows the results of the analysis of fish and fish maw 
samples for parvalbumin using the cod parvalbumin antiserum.

* Results based on the assumption that all soluble parvalbumin is extracted and has comparable 
immunoreactivity as cod parvalbumin. 
 
All of the tested fish species extracts have parvalbumin, based on SDS-PAGE and 
immunoblotting.  However, with the exception of cod, these fish extracts do not react in the 
ELISA.  While some of the maw samples gave weak positive results in this parvalbumin ELISA, 
these preliminary results are of only limited value.  It may be that the extraction procedure does 
not recover 100% of the parvalbumin, but it was clearly shown that a 12 kDa band was present 
in the extracts, comparable to extraction in the presence of SDS in the SDS-PAGE studies.  
Thus, incomplete recovery cannot explain the lack of reactivity of the extracts in the sandwich 
ELISA for cod parvalbumin.

Analysis of 11 samples of fish isinglass 
Eleven samples of isinglass were analyzed with the sandwich ELISA for cod parvalbumin.  
Table 5.3 shows the results.  
 
It is important to note that the fish species tested within the framework of this project (except 
cod) do not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, even although there is evidence 
for the presence of parvalbumin, based on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting results.

Table 5.3 shows that low levels of parvalbumin are detectable in isinglass samples.  Dilutions of 
isinglass were not parallel with dilutions of cod parvalbumin, and true quantification therefore is 
not possible. The non-parallelism is illustrated by the high standard deviation (same order of 
magnitude as response), and by the increasing calculated value for higher diluted extracts (data 
not shown here).  The non-parallelism may be caused by differences in the affinity of cod 
parvalbumin and parvalbumin of other fishes to the anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  
Differences between isinglass samples are apparent.  These may be explained by differences in 
parvalbumin content, but due to the issues mentioned above, this is not conclusive.  It should 
furthermore be taken into consideration that isinglass matrix inhibits the signal of cod 
parvalbumin slightly (2 to 4 fold). Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

 D.  Discussion: 
 
A sandwich ELISA was successfully developed for detection of cod parvalbumin using anti-cod 
parvalbumin polyclonal antisera.  The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not 
substantially cross-react with common food ingredients. The ELISA could detect cod 
parvalbumin spiked into isinglass.  The sensitivity of the cod parvalbumin ELISA at 0.20 µg/g is 
excellent and equivalent or superior to commercial ELISAs for peanut, gluten, and β-
lactoglobulin.  These results suggested that the sandwich ELISA could be used for measuring 
residual parvalbumin in isinglass and in  other food matrices. Furthermore, purified parvalbumin 
spiked into beer and wine is not substantially inhibited.  However, some decrease of parvalbumin 
reactivity was observed when purified parvalbumin was spiked into isinglass.  
 
Although the tested fish flesh samples display a 12 kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE that is 
reactive with the anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum (see Figure 4.1), attempts to absolutely 
quantitate the level of parvalbumin in extracts of the muscle tissues and maws of fish species 
used to manufacture isinglass by ELISA were not successful.  Five of 6 maws did not react 
either; in one of the maws, some reactivity was found.  As noted above, several possible reasons 
exist for these unexpected results.  One possibility is the the specificity of the polyclonal anti-
cod parvalbumin antiserum is not suitable for the detection of parvalbumin in the muscles or 
maws of these particular species.  However, further research might well allow use of this 
antiserum or some combination of this antiserum with the anti-carp and anti-frog parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibodies described elsewhere (see FARRP-07-2006)  for the development of an 
ELISA that would be reliable for detection of parvalbumin in these muscle and maw extracts.  
This research group simply ran out of time to solve this technical problem in meeting the EFSA 
deadline for submission of data.  Certainly, it would be premature to conclude that these fish and 
maw samples have low or no parvalbumin. 
 
Curiously, parvalbumin could be detected at low levels in isinglass samples even though it could 
not be detected in extracts of muscle or maws of the species of fish used to prepare the isinglass.  
The reasons for this result are not clear.  The quantitative estimation of parvalbumin levels in 
isinglass is not reliable based upon the problems with the current anti-cod fish parvalbumin 
ELISA method.  However, the levels of residual parvalbumin in isinglass are definitely quite 
low, although it is impossible to indicate exactly how low.  As noted previously, because of the 
water solubility of parvalbumins, the expectation would be that the parvalbumin is removed from 
isinglass during the washing steps of the isinglass-manufacturing process.  However, fish 
collagen is used commercially for its ability to entrap and remove materials including proteins 
from alcoholic beverages.  Thus, it is not surprising that low levels of parvalbumin might remain 
despite extensive washing.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_4.pdf,"Appendix 3

Executive Summary 
 
Traditionally, many types of beer are clarified (fined) by the addition of isinglass, which is a 
pure form of fish collagen. The isinglass combines with proteins and yeast in suspension in 
the beer, causing the formation of large flocs which sediment out of the beer. In some 
beers these flocs are removed in the brewery by filtration of centrifugation. Such beers are 
described as brewery-conditione d beers. However, in some beer styles (known as cask-
conditioned beers) the flocs ar e not removed but form a compact sediment at the bottom 
of the container (the cask). Only the beer above this sediment is marketable. 
 
A method has been developed wher eby residual isinglass presen t in fined beers can be 
concentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The separated 
isinglass can then be hydrolysed to its consti tuent acids and quantifie d by measuring the 
content of hydroxyproli ne, which is an imino acid present in significant quantities only in 
animal collagens. The limit of quant ification of this method, t hat is the concentration of 
isinglass in beer which can be distinguished fr om background levels of hydroxyproline, is 
0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry weight basis).  
 
This method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which could 
be present in brewery- and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine whether there is 
likely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn from a position close to 
the bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be marketable, could nevertheless contain 
significantly higher concentrations of isinglass.  
 
The results indicate that residues in many bottled and canned beers fine d with isinglass in 
the brewery are below t he limit of quantificati on of the method. Wher e isinglass could be 
quantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed 1mg/litre. 
 
For large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were on ly slightly higher. 
Residues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional samples could 
contain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beer s, the highest concentration of isinglass 
found did not exceed 5 mg/litre. 
 
There was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The 
concentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above the 
level of sedimented material) was marginally  higher than in the bulk, but still below 5 
mg/litre.

Introduction and Background 
 
Isinglass is used as a clarif ying (fining) agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage 
(typically 15 mg/litre; total range 10 - 70 mg/ litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it 
reacts with yeast and proteins, forming large flo cs. These flocs are removed from the bulk 
of the liquid by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Thus practically all the isinglass is 
removed and the product as presented to the c onsumer contains only small quantities of 
residues.  
 
Although isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for centuries, extensive 
searches of the scientific and medical litera ture have not identified any documented cases 
of allergy due to the isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of allergic reactions 
to isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all, is extremely rare.  
 
New, comprehensive studies into the potential allergenicity of  isinglass have been carried 
out and are reported elsewhere in this dossier. The potential for allergenic reactions to 
occur is also influenced by the amount of residues consumed. Little robust data is 
available in the lit erature relating to the concentrations of isinglass which remain in fined 
beers.  This section of the dossier therefore reports on st udies carried out in order to 
quantify more precisely the amount of isinglass present in typical fined beers and also to 
define the maximum range of residue levels whic h could remain in t he beer in a worst 
case.  
 
 
Experimental approaches 
 
Analysis of residues 
The measurement of isinglas s residues in beer is complicated by three factors in 
particular; 
• The concentration of residues is expected to be low, so one or more concentration 
steps would be required 
• Isinglass is a protein; beer contains several other proteins  in addition to isinglass, 
and these are present in much larger quantities, making  identification and 
separation difficult 
• The isinglass residues may include fragments,  making it difficult to separate or 
identify them using methods based on molecular weight.  
 
In the current study, it was decided that th e best approach would be to use an antibody 
raised against isinglass. This would not only introduce specificity and provide a valuable 
concentration step, but should also allow for the detection of more of the smaller fragments 
of isinglass which might not be precipitated by ammonium sulphate alone.   
 
The antibody would be used to collect and c oncentrate the isinglass residues from a 
sample of beer.  In order to quantify these residues use was made of the unusual amino 
acid content of isinglass. Isinglass is a pu re form of collagen, which is characterised by 
presence of hydroxyproline. This  imino acid is rare in other  proteins but is key to the 
structure and functionality of isinglass. The hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline stabilises the 
helical structure of collagen thro ugh the formation of H bonds (Moir et al, 1984). As there 
is no other source of collagen in the bre wing process, and since hydroxyproline is not 
                                                            Page        of   17 5Appendix 3 
present in significant quantit ies in proteins other than collagen, measurement of 
hydroxyproline in the hydrolyse d residues provides a specific  means of quantification of 
isinglass. 
 
Cask-conditioned beers 
For the overwhelming majority (over 90%) of  fined beers, whether destined for canning, 
bottling or draught, isinglass residues are removed in the brewery by filtration or 
centrifugation. Cask-conditio ned beer, however, (often described as “real ale”) is a 
traditional style of be er and is unique to the UK. It r epresents an important traditional 
product, but is a niche market, and sales have continued to decline, from almost 17% of 
UK beer sales in 1980 to 6.6% in 2004 (British Beer and Pub Assoc. 2005).

Nevertheless, consumers of cask ales tend to be loyal to this product type, and could 
drink, on average, around 12 pint s (6.8 litres) per week. T he typical cask ale consumer 
tends to be in the 35+ age gr oup (Table 1) with a high fr equency-low volume consumption 
pattern rather than the low frequency-high volume pattern which is more common amongst 
younger consumers.

In cask-conditioned beer, the yeast remains in the cask, and promotes flavour changes 
that contribute to the essential character of the final product. Is inglass is dosed either into 
the beer before filling or directly into the cask, at a rate of, typically, 50 mg/litre. The action 
of isinglass takes place gener ally within the first 3 to 4 hours after filling so that the 
flocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) rapidly settle to the base of the cask, 
forming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the 
sediment. For this style of beer, the beer serv ed must be bright (i.e. no cloudiness) and be 
free of suspended particles. Clo udy beer is not acceptable to  the consumer. In order to 
facilitate the dispense of clear beer, and to  avoid drawing on the sedimented material, 
there is a gap between the bottom of the cask and the position of the tap. This means that 
a certain volume of beer, generally around 2 litres, is not dispensed. This, which is known 
as the ullage, contains the sedimented material, together wit h the overwhelming majority 
of the isinglass. However, it is theoretically possible that t here could be some stratification 
of isinglass residues within the bulk of the ca sk, with lower layers of dispensable beer 
potentially containing more isinglass than t he higher levels. This possibility has been 
investigated in order to establish what the “worst case” expo sure might be for the 
consumer.

Materials and Methods 
 
Preparation and testing of the Antibody 
Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by the specialist company Biogenesis UK. The 
immunogens were commercial samples of pure isinglass (both powder and paste) 
                                                            Page        of   17 7Appendix 3 
provided by the major suppliers of commercial isinglass. Although processing details may 
vary between manufacturers, all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from 
the same limited range of tropical fish. Thus the isinglass samples used are expected to be 
representative of those marketed for fining beer. The antibodies pr ovided required some 
initial purification prior to use.  Serum was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C 
using a Beckman centrifuge.  The supernat ant was carefully poured off and the pellet 
discarded.  Ammonium sulphate was slowly added to the supernatant to achieve a final 
concentration of 30% (saturation), and then sti rred for 30 minutes at room temperature to 
encourage precipitation of IgG.  The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes 
at 4°C, then the supernatant was carefully re moved and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml 
of 0.9% saline (w/v).  The ammonium sulphate precipitation procedure was repeated for a 
second time and the resulting pellet was re -suspended in 0.9% salin e.  The purified 
antibody solution was dialysed overnight in  phosphate buffered saline, using dialysis 
tubing with a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cut-off.   The antibody solution was stored in the 
fridge in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide until required. 
 
The purified antibodies were tested against the immunogen usin g an ELISA protocol. The 
ELISA plates were coated with 1 µg of isinglass, using 200 μl of a solution of isinglass per 
well. Serial dilutions (10 fo ld) of the pre-immune and imm une sera were prepared at the 
same time. The antisera were in cubated in the treated wells at 37 oC for 30 minutes. The 
reaction was visualised with an alkaline ph osphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and 
para-nitrophenol phosphate at 405 nm.

Separation of isinglass residues from beer 
The control beer used for method developm ent was a BRi standar d beer, prepared in the 
BRi pilot brewery without the use of isinglass.  
 
Beer was degassed overnight at room temperature. The pH of  the beer was adjusted to 
7.0, using a magnetic stirrer with drop-wise addition of 3M NaOH, allowing any precipitated 
materials to re-dissolve.  It was important that this was done slow ly and that the pH-
adjusted beer should still be bright. 
 
Antibody (200μl) was added to 100 ml of beer and the mixture was stirred gently at room 
temperature for 30 minutes. The antibody-ant igen complex was then precipitated using 
ammonium sulphate added to 30% saturation.   Again the ammonium sulphate was added 
slowly with constant gently stirring. (30% saturation required 17.6 g of ammonium sulphate 
per 100 ml of beer). The beer/ammonium sulphate mixture, wit h precipitated materials, 
was stirred for a further 30 minutes. 
 
The precipitate containing the antibody-isinglass complex was then collected by 
centrifugation (6500 rpm for 20 minutes) using round bottom centrifuge bottles.  The 
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re -dissolved in 16 ml of 20 mM phosphate 
buffer pH 7, with vortexing. 
 
The re-dissolved antibody-isinglass complex was then dialysed against deionised water 
using Spectropore CE dialysis tubing. This dialysis tubing has a molecular weight cut off of 
3.5 kDa (equivalent to approxim ately 25-30 amino acid residu es).  Dialysis was for 20 
hours with three changes of water. The liquid wa s transferred from the dialysis tubing into 
round bottom flasks and frozen in solid carbon dioxide.  The samples were then reduced to 
dryness in a lyophiliser (usually 48 hours). Hydroxyproline content was then determined on 
these samples. 
 
Hydrolysis of residues to constituent amino acids and derivatisation.  
Test samples were reconstituted and hydrol ysed to their constituent amino acids using 
HCl. Two ml of 50% HCl was added to the r ound bottom flask to dissolve the sample 
which was then transferred to a 4 ml vial and the flask was rinsed with a further 2 ml of HCl 
which was also added to the vial. The seal ed vial was then heated for 4 hr at 100 °C then 
allowed to cool prior to derivatisation. 
 
Hydroxyproline and other amino acids in the hydrolysate we re derivatised and quantified 
were using a Phenomenex EZ:faast™ kit, accordi ng to the manufacturer’s instructions. In 
some cases the identity of the reagents was not  disclosed, the name used here is that 
provided by the kit manufacturers.   
Eluting Medium, Reagent 3, ( 200 µl) was added to 100 µl of hydrolysate, 95 µl KOH (400 
mg/ml) and 100 µl of Internal Standard (R eagent 1). After thorough mixing, 50 µl of 
Reagent 4 was added to the preparation vial. 
 
The mixture was emulsified by vortexing for 15 seconds and then allo wed to stand for at 
least 1 minute. During this period the amino acids were converted to derivatives which 
were more volatile than the original acids. 
 
                                                            Page        of   17 9Appendix 3 
The mixture was re-emulsified by vortexing for at least 15 seconds and again allowed to 
separate over a period of 1 minute.  Reagent 5 (50 µl) was then added to the mixture, 
which was vortexed for 15 seconds and allo wed to stand for 1 minute.  After phase 
separation, 400 µl of hexane was added to the vial. 
 
The upper, organic layer was removed to a cl ean vial and gently evaporated to near-
dryness under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The residue was then re-dissolved in 100 µl of 
Tri-Sil TBT.  After 20 minutes , 500 µL of hexane was added to the vial followed by 500 µl 
of water.  The upper, organic layer was removed to a vial for GC-MS analysis. 
 
 
Quantification of Hydroxyproline 
Derivatised hydroxyproline was separated and quantified by gas chromatography with 
mass spectrophotometric detection. The GC -MS was fitted with a Phenomenex ZB-50 
column and operated in selected ion m onitoring mode. The quant ification ion for 
hydroxyproline was m/z 244,  with 158 and 142 as qualifier ions. Identification was 
confirmed from retention times and by matchi ng the qualifier ion rati os with those of the 
authentic compound.  Norvaline was used as the internal standard.  
 
Quantification was carried out using standard curves prepared by derivatisation of 
solutions of hydroxyproline over the range 0 - 200 nanomoles/ml. The limit of detection, 
defined as three times the signal  to noise ratio for a reagent blank, for hydroxyproline on 
the GC-MS was 40 picomoles/ml or 10 picogr ams injected. Allowing for the concentration 
of the beer during prepar ation of the samples, this corresp onds to a limit of detection of 
approximately 1 µg/litre of hydroxyproline in the beer. The limit of quantification for 
hydroxyproline in beer is approx imately three times the limit of detection, i.e. 3 µg/litre. 
Figures 3 and 4 show total ion and selected ion chromatograms respectively for a 50 
nmoles/ml hydroxyproline standard.

Correlation of hydroxyproline with isinglass  
The values obtained from the GC-MS anal ysis were in terms of nanomoles of 
hydroxyproline. These had then to be converted to weights of isingl ass. A calibration was 
developed by hydrolyzing know n concentrations of isingl ass and analyzing them for 
hydroxyproline as described above (see Figure 5). 
 
 
 
Recovery 
The recovery of isinglass from beer was esti mated by adding a known weight of isinglass 
to beer produced in BRi’s pilot brewery without the use of isinglass, then analyzing aliquots 
using the antibody procedure as previously de scribed. At an addition rate of 2.26 mg 
isinglass (dry basis) / 100ml beer, the recovery ranged from 87 – 91.5%.

Survey of commercial small pack beers 
Bottled and canned commercial beers were purchased in the UK in 2004/2005. Brands 
were chosen to include: 
• Different beer styles (lagers, ales, stouts) 
• Large national / international and small regional producers 
• Pack type (cans and bottles) 
• Beer known to be produced without isingl ass (produced in BRi’s pilot brewery) as 
well as brands known to be fined with isinglass  
 
Cask-conditioned beer 
A commercial brand of ale know n to use a high isinglass do se rate (72 mg/litre) was 
selected.  A cask was obtained  from commercial wholesal er, set up in the BRi beer 
dispense cellar at 12 °C, and allowed to settle for 3 days, as would be usual in commercial 
practice.  
The sampling protocol was designed to simulate a situation in a retail outlet in which beer 
is supplied to customers intermittently over several days. A 1 litre sample was taken via 
the tap and retained for analysis.  The next day several litres were drawn off and a further 
sample taken for analysis. This was repeated over the next week until the cask was almost 
empty and the beer sample was unaccept ably cloudy and would not have been 
marketable. This sample represents the beginnings of the ullage.  
 
In addition, single samples were taken of a number of other brands of  cask ale. In these 
cases the samples were taken when the casks were approximately half empty.  
 
Keg beer 
A keg containing an international brand of brewery-conditioned beer was set up in the BRi 
cellar and sampled as described for the ca sk-conditioned ale, except that, since 
sedimented material had been removed by filt ration in the brewery, the bottom samples 
remained clear and marketable.

Results 
 
Background levels of hydroxyproline in beer 
In order to establish the backg round levels, if any, of hydr oxyproline in beer, control beers 
were prepared in the BRI pilo t brewery without using any is inglass. A total of eight 
samples, from 3 replicate all-malt brews, were taken and analysed for hydroxyproline 
using the antibody technique described. A mean concentration of 0.009 mg/litre of 
hydroxyproline was detected in the isingla ss free control beer. This background level, 
which corresponds to 0.17 mg/litre of isinglass,  was taken as the limit  of quantification of 
isinglass in beer.

Table 2 lists the results for 13 commercial pa ckaged beers, including 8 ales which were 
known to be clarified in the brewery using is inglass. Hydroxyproline could be detected in 
all of the samples except for three ales. When this was converted to isinglass equivalents,

it can be seen that all the la gers and one of the stout samples were below the limit of 
quantification for isinglass. Al though there was some variatio n between different samples, 
all contained less than 1 mg isinglass per litre of beer.

Table 3 shows the concentration  of isinglass residues found in  a brewery-conditioned keg 
beer dispensed over a period of time. Concent rations were slightly higher than in small-
pack beers, but the highest concentration found was below 3 mg/litre, with a mean of 1.0 
mg/litre. Although there was some variation in  isinglass concentrations, there was no 
evidence of any stratification of residues wit hin the keg and there was no accumulation of 
isinglass residues at the bottom of the keg.

Table 4 shows the concentration of isingl ass residues found in a cask-conditioned ale 
dispensed over a period of time. Within the bulk of the cask (t hat is, the beer which would 
be served to the customer) isinglass residues remained below 3 mg/ litre, with a mean of 
1.8 mg/litre and no evidence of stratification. The last sample which was drawn was 
noticeably hazy to the naked eye, and this cont ained a higher concentration of isinglass, 
                                                            Page        of   17 14Appendix 3 
3.6 mg/litre. Samples drawn fr om below this point represen ted the ullage, and contained 
visible yeast and protein clumps. The concentrati on of isinglass at this level was very high 
(> 100 mg/litre) but since it was associated with the solid material, the distribution was 
non-homogeneous and difficult to determine with any accuracy. 
 
Samples were also taken from a number of other brands of cask al e, including one micro-
brewery brand, and tested for isinglass residues. These were taken from casks 
approximately half empty. Results are shown in Table 5.

Brand 5 0.084 1.6 
Brand 6 0.219 4.2 
Brand 7 0.014 0.3 
 
Concentrations of isinglass in these 7 brands were similar to those found in the 
stratification study, with the highest concentr ation found being 4.2 mg/litre. This suggests 
that the cask chosen for the st ratification study was representative of other brands of cask 
ale.  
 
Discussion  
 
The studies reported here indicate that the overwhelming majority of the isinglass added to 
beer as a fining agent is either removed in the brewery (for brewer y-conditioned beers) or 
is contained in the sediments at the botto m of the cask (for cask-conditioned beers). In 
each case, the concentrations of isingla ss contained in the beer marketed and consumed 
by the drinker are extremely low. Precise quantif ication of the resi dues which could be 
consumed is complicated by the presence of a wide range of other proteins, by the likely 
heterogeneous nature of the isinglass residues themselves an d by the fact that the levels 
are close to the limits of quantification. These complications have undoubtedly reduced the 
precision of the determinations.  
 
Only a few other attempts to quantify isingla ss residues in beer hav e been reported. One 
method has been developed in New Zealand, (Hofman & MacDonald, 2002). The details 
of this method are not publicly available, bu t it is understood to be based on the classic 
biochemical principles of prec ipitation of the prot ein by ammonium su lphate, followed by 
separation of the protein molecu les on the basis of size and el ectrical charge. Using this 
method, levels of isinglass residues in a small number of commercial beers from Australia 
and New Zealand (all brewery- conditioned brands) were found to be in the range 0.02 - 
0.16 mg/litre (Hofman et al, 2002) . These values are similar to those found in the current 
study for small-pack brewery conditioned lagers. They ar e lower than some of the 
brewery-conditioned ales tested,  but this is not surprising given the different brewing 
styles. In addition, any method based on molecu lar size runs the risk of missing fragments 
                                                            Page        of   17 15Appendix 3 
which may (but also may not) have the same or  similar allergenic potential to the parent 
molecule.  One advantage of th e antibody method used in the pr esent study is that both 
parent molecule and larger fragments should be detected.  
 
Other groups have also used hydroxyproline measurement as a means of detecting or 
quantifying isinglass (Leach, 1969; Chlup et al, 2006). The first of these (Leach, 1969) 
was a colorimetric test, and was qualitative only, since the amount of hydroxyproline 
present was too small to quantify with the techniques available at that time. It was used for 
determining whether or not a beer had been fined with isinglass. More recently a group at 
the Heriot-Watt University in Scotland also  used determination of hydroxyproline as a 
method of quantifying isinglass residues in beer (Chlup et al, 2006). This group, who were 
not using any concentration techniques, found that although hydr oxyproline could be 
detected in cask beers immediately after the fi nings were added, the levels fell to below 
the limit of detection once the beer had settled (typically  2 -3 days).   
 
As previously noted, hydroxypro line is generally considered to occur at significant levels 
only in animal collagen. Howeve r, there are published reports in  the scientific literature of 
glycoproteins containing hydr oxyproline in higher plants (Cleland, 1968; Stuart and 
Varner, 1980).The current study did detec t low levels of hydroxyproline in beer which had 
not been treated with finings. This has not been previously reported, probably because 
methods have not been sufficiently sensitive. If barley contained similar proteins, any 
fragments remaining in the beer would hav e been concentrated by  the extraction 
procedure used in the study repor ted here. Thus the background levels of hydroxyproline 
detected in unfined beer are a likely consequence of the low limit of detection of the 
method used.  
 
In the current study, cask beer was sampled on a daily basis, over a total time period of 
one week, with the final samples being drawn from close to the sedimented material, 
where they appeared visibly cloudy. In fact, the flavour of a cask beer will begin to 
deteriorate if it is not cons umed within 3-4 days after tapping. Thus in commercial practice 
casks may be replaced before a ll the marketable beer has been consumed. Thus the 
maximum concentrations detected in this study are likely to represent a “worst case” as far 
as dietary exposure for the consumer is concerned.  
 
Conclusions 
 
The results of the study reported here confirm that the concentration of residues remaining 
in beers fined with isinglass is indeed very low. For many bottled and canned beers, levels 
of isinglass are below the lim it of quantification.  Slightly higher concentrations may be 
found in beers in large containers such as  kegs and casks, but even here the maximum 
concentrations would be likely to remain bel ow 5 mg/litre. There is no evidence of 
significant stratification of isinglass resi dues in the marketable beer in such bulk 
containers.

Isinglass is a purified collagen derived from the swim bladders of select tropical and subtropical fish species. It has been used for centuries in brewing to clarify beer, and is removed from the final product through filtration or sedimentation. The petition presents comprehensive scientific, analytical, and clinical evidence demonstrating that isinglass does not pose an allergenic risk to fish-allergic individuals. Key findings include: • Clinical trials (including double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges) show no allergic reactions in fish-sensitive individuals, even at doses equivalent to extreme beer consumption. • Manufacturing protocols have been optimized to minimize residual parvalbumin, the primary fish allergen, in commercial isinglass products. • Analytical data confirms that residual isinglass and parvalbumin levels in beer are extremely low, often below detection limits. • International regulatory bodies (EFSA, FSANZ, Health Canada) have granted similar exemptions based on comparable evidence. • Literature reviews and updated searches found no documented cases of allergic reactions to isinglass in beer or wine. The petition concludes that isinglass-fined beer does not elicit allergic responses and supports its exemption from allergen labelling requirements, aligning with global regulatory practices and current scientific consensus.",me8-erwz-9vcx,,Comment(s),0,,,Wolverhampton,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,19,2025-08-12 21:42:16,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0003-0185/attachment_3.pdf,"

Literature Search Report for Parvalbumin and Isinglass 
Allergenicity  
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The objective of this report is to outline a search strategy and identify pertinent scientific literature related 
to the allergenicity of parvalbumin or isinglass used in beer production. Intertek Health Sciences Inc. 
therefore conducted a comprehensive literature search using the electronic search tool ProQuest Dialog™ 
(ProQuest) on 20 June 2025. Details of the search strategy, including the inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
literature filtration, are provided in Section 2.0. The results of the literature search are provided in Section 
3.0. 
2.0 LITERATURE SEARCH METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Search Strategy 
The following databases were searched using ProQuest: Adis Clinical Trials Insight, AGRICOLA, AGRIS, 
Allied & Complementary Medicine™, BIOSIS® Toxicology, BIOSIS Previews®, CAB ABSTRACTS, Embase®, 
Foodline®: SCIENCE, FSTA®, MEDLINE®, NTIS: National Technical Information Service, ToxFile®, and

2.2 Literature Filtration 
Once the search strategy was implemented and the publication titles were retrieved, the relevance of the 
publications was determined at 3 stages using the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the publications. At each 
stage, the exclusion criteria listed in Table 2.2-1 were applied to determine literature relevance. The 
3 stages of literature filtration are outlined below in greater detail. 
Stage 1: Titles of articles were reviewed, and abstracts of titles determined to be potentially relevant 
were retrieved. 
Stage 2:  Abstracts were reviewed, and full-length articles of abstracts determined to be potentially 
relevant were retrieved. 
Stage 3:  Full-length articles were reviewed, and those determined to meet any one of the exclusion 
criteria specified in Table 2.2-1 were excluded. 
Table 2.2-1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Used to Filter the Identified Literature

Investigation of the allergenic potential of wines fined with various proteinogenic fining agents by ELISA  
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 55.8 p.3127-3133 (Apr 18, 2007): p. 3127-3133. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Hidden allergens are a common problem in food safety that has been known for many years. This is why the European Parliament 
adopted Directive 2003/89/EC amending 2000/13/EC. In addition to specific ingredients, Directive 2003/89/EC also requests the 
declaration of specific products that were used in the production and could be a risk for allergic individuals. This also includes the 
declaration of fining agents and lysozyme used in wines. In fact, it could be assumed that fining agents would be almost 
completely removed during the manufacturing process; however, until now there has been no necessity to analyze wine for these 
fining agents. By applying enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), residuals of fining agent proteins and the stabilizer 
lysozyme were investigated in various German wines. The results showed no detectable amounts of fining agents in wines, except 
for dried egg white and lysozyme, both derived from hen's egg white. For those products, adverse reactions against treated wines 
could not be excluded.

Abstract (English):  
OBJECTIVE 
Recent Australian and international legislation requires labeling of wines made by using the potentially allergenic food proteins 
casein, milk, egg white, or isinglass (fish-derived) where “there is a detectable residual processing aid.” We investigated whether 
wines fined using these proteins or non-grape-derived tannins (tree-nut derived) can provoke significant clinical allergic reactions 
(anaphylaxis) in patients with confirmed immunoglobulin E-mediated relevant food allergy. 
 
METHODS 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine whether allergic reactions followed consumption of 
Australian commercial wines fined using one or more of the legislation-targeted food proteins. In addition, allergenicity of a larger 
panel of these wines was evaluated by blood basophil activation. 
 
RESULTS 
No anaphylaxis was induced by wine consumption. Three mild clinical reactions to protein-fined wine and two mild reactions to 
unfined wine occurred, but there was no statistically significant difference in reaction parameters between subject groups or 
between processing aids. No pattern of basophil activation correlated with wine type, processing aid, or subject group. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Wines fined with egg white, isinglass, or non-grape-derived tannins present an extremely low risk of anaphylaxis to fish-, egg-, or 
peanut-allergic consumers. Although consumption of milk protein-fined wine did not induce anaphylaxis, there were insufficient 
subjects to determine statistically whether wines fined with milk proteins present a risk to the very rare milk-allergic consumers. 
In summary, the observed lack of anaphylaxis and basophil activation induced by wines made using the legislation-targeted food 
proteins according to good manufacturing practice suggests negligible residual food allergens in these wines.  CONFIDENTIAL

Development of animal models and sandwich-ELISA tests to detect the allergenicity and antigenicity of fining agent residues in 
wines

Abstract (English):  
Food allergy can cause food-related anaphylaxis. Food allergen labeling is the principal means of protecting sensitized individuals. 
This motivated European Directive 2003/89 on the labeling of ingredients or additives that could trigger adverse reactions, which 
has been in effect since 2005. During this study, we developed animal models with allergy to ovalbumin, caseinate, and isinglass 
in order to be able to detect fining agent residues that could induce anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. The second aim of 
the study was to design sandwich ELISA tests specific to each fining agent in order to detect their residue antigenicity, both during 
wine processing and in commercially available bottled wines. Sensitized mice and sandwich ELISA methods were established to 
test a vast panel of wines. The results showed that although they were positive to our highly sensitive sandwich-ELISA tests, some 
commercially available wines are not allergenic in sensitized mice. Commercially available bottled wines made using standardized 
processes, fining, maturation, and filtration, do not therefore represent any risk of anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. 
Allergenicity of wine containing processing aids: a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge

Publication details: Journal of Investigational Allergology & Clinical Immunology 19.3 (2009): 210-7. 
 
Abstract (English):  
BACKGROUND 
The European Union requires allergenic food ingredients to appear on labels in order to protect allergic consumers. 
 
OBJECTIVE 
To determine whether traces of egg-, milk-, and fish-derived processing aids used in winemaking might elicit clinical reactions in 
food-allergic patients. 
 
METHODS 
Five German wines were fined with a high dose of egg albumin, lysozyme, milk casein, fish gelatin, or isinglass, and filtered. 
Fourteen adults with allergy to egg (n = 5), milk (n = 5), or fish (n = 4) were included. Skin prick tests were performed with fining 
agents, and fined and unfined wines. All patients underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges with fined and 
unfined wines. 
 
RESULTS 
Skin prick tests were positive to hen's egg (n = 5), ovalbumin (n = 5), lysozyme (n = 4), cow's milk (n = 5), casein (n = 4), and cod 
(n = 3), but not to isinglass or fish gelatin (n = 0). Positive skin prick test results were observed for wines fined with albumin 
(n = 3), lysozyme (n = 2), casein (n = 1), gelatin (n = 0), and isinglass (n = 3), and for unfined wines (n = 1-2 in each patient group), 
with no significant differences between groups. Seventy-five percent of skin test-positive patients had specific immunoglobulin E 
to other allergens present in wine (eg, carbohydrates). The provocation test revealed no reactions to fined or unfined wines. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Although concentrated fining agents containing ovalbumin, lysozyme, and casein were allergenic in the skin prick test, no patient 
reacted adversely in the provocation test to fined wine. Wines treated with fining agents at commercial concentrations appear 
not to present a risk to allergic individuals when filtered.  CONFIDENTIAL

Allergenic potential of fining agent residues in German wines related to their dosage and an ordinary bentonite treatment  
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech 18.5 (2007): 22-24. 
 
Abstract (English):  
The effects of fining agent dosage (isinglass, potassium caseinate, dried egg white and gelatin derived from fish skin) and 
bentonite treatment on the amount of fining agent residues in German wines was studied. Fining agent proteins were measured 
by ELISA. Significant levels of fining agent residues were found neither in wines treated with an ordinary dosage nor in wines 
treated with an excess dosage of fining agents. Furthermore, significant levels of residues were found neither in wines with 
bentonite treatment nor in wines without bentonite treatment. 
Characterization, antigenicity and detection of fish gelatin and isinglass used as processing aid in wine 
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Food Additives and Contaminants 27.3 (Mar 2010): 273-282. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Fish gelatin (FG) and isinglass (IG) are commonly used in the production of food and beverage products, as clarification aids or 
carriers for dyes, flavours and vitamins. There is a call for products processed with these fish-derived compounds to be labelled, 
for reasons of food safety (potential allergenicity), religious and ethical concerns and consumer protection. The aim of this study 
was to develop a reliable and sensitive method for the detection of FG and IG in foods. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against 
fish collagen and used to develop a sensitive indirect ELISA for the detection of FG and IG. Levels of less than 0.11 mcg/ml of FG 
and IG were detected and the method was successfully applied to the determination of FG and IG in wines. Wines, which had 
been processed with FG or IG and which had not been additionally treated with bentonite (for protein adsorption) and successive 
filtration, were found to have residues of up to 0.33 mcg/ml of FG and/of IG.

Abstract (English):  
BACKGROUND 
European legislators and wine producers still debate on the requirement for labeling of wines fined with potentially allergenic 
food proteins (casein, egg white or fish-derived isinglass). We investigated whether wines fined with known concentrations of 
these proteins have the potential to provoke clinical allergic reactions in relevant patients. 
 
METHODS 
In-house wines were produced for the study, fined with different concentrations of casein (n = 7), egg albumin (n = 1) and 
isinglass (n = 3). ELISA and PCR kits specific for the respective proteins were used to identify the fining agents. Skin prick tests and 
basophil activation tests were performed in patients with confirmed IgE-mediated relevant food allergies (n = 24). A wine 
consumption questionnaire and detailed history on possible reactions to wine was obtained in a multinational cohort of milk, egg 
or fish allergic patients (n = 53) and patients allergic to irrelevant foods as controls (n = 13). 
 
RESULTS 
Fining agents were not detectable in wines with the available laboratory methods. Nevertheless, positive skin prick test reactions 
and basophil activation to the relevant wines were observed in the majority of patients with allergy to milk, egg or fish, 
correlating with the concentration of the fining agent. Among patients consuming wine, reported reactions were few and mild 
and similar with the ones reported from the control group.  CONFIDENTIAL

CONCLUSION 
Casein, isinglass or egg, remaining in traces in wine after fining, present a very low risk for the respective food allergic consumers. 
Physician and patient awareness campaigns may be more suitable than generalized labeling to address this issue, as the latter 
may have negative impact on both non-allergic and allergic consumers.

Abstract (summary):  
The major allergen parvalbumin was purified from cod muscle tissues, and polyclonal antibodies were raised towards it. The 
antibodies were tested for specificity and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using these antibodies. 
The ELISA was applied to measure parvalbumin in cod skin, the starting material for fish gelatin made from deep sea, wild fish. 
The ELISA was sufficiently sensitive (LLOQ = 0.8 ng ml (-1) in extracts, corresponding to 0.02 µg of parvalbumin per g of tissue), 
and did not cross-react with common food constituents. Fish gelatin, wine and beer, matrices for the potential use of this ELISA, 
did not cause disturbance of the assay performance. The data show that the parvalbumin content in cod muscle tissue is 6.25 mg 
g (-1), while the skins contained considerably less, 0.4 mg g (-1) Washing of the skins, a common industrial procedure during the 
manufacturing of fish gelatin, reduced the level of parvalbumin about 1000-fold to 0.5 µg g (-1), or 0.5 ppm. From 95 commercial 
lots of fish gelatin it is shown that 73 are below 0.02 µg g (-1) parvalbumin. From the other 22 lots, the one with the highest 
concentration contained 0.15 µg g (-1) of parvalbumin. These levels are generally assumed to be safe for fish-allergic individuals.

Abstract (English):  
Proteinaceous products are widely used as fining agents during winemaking to remove unwanted insoluble particles and 
undissolved microscopic particles (colloidal material) from the must or wine to improve stability. Some of them (egg white, 
caseinates, and fish gelatine) have allergenic potential and the presence of their residues in the final product could represent a 
risk for allergic individuals. Moreover, lysozyme (an egg allergen) is included among wine additives to control the fermentation 
processes and avoid spoiling during winemaking. The aim of this paper is to review the experimental/clinical data on the use of 
allergenic products in enology and the measurement of relative risk for sensitized subjects. In addition, methods developed 
specifically for the quantification of allergenic residues in must and wine are described.  CONFIDENTIAL

Allergic and intolerance reactions to wine  
 
Author: Wüthrich, B 1 1 Specialist for Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Specialist for Dermatology, Zollikerberg, Switzerland,

Publication details: Allergologie select 2.1 (Sep 1, 2018): 80-88. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Hypersensitivity reactions to alcoholic beverages (particularly red wine) are relatively frequent, affecting 10% of the general 
population. Hypersensitivity reactions due to alcoholic drinks, mainly in the form of airway reactions (rhinitis and asthma), occur 
significantly more frequently in persons with pre-existing rhinitis and asthma. In terms of pathogenesis, it has to be differentiated 
between immunologic, mainly IgE-mediated, hypersensitivity reactions (wine allergies), and intolerance reactions in which no 
causative allergen-specific immune mechanisms can be detected. Allergens responsible for wine allergy could be: grape (Vitis 
vinifera) proteins (particularly the major allergen lipid transfer protein Vit v1), proteins and ingredients used for the fining of 
wines such as fish gelatin or isinglass (swim bladder of the fish huso, family of sturgeons), ovalbumin, dairy (casein) products, gum 
arabic, enzymes (lysozyme, pectinase, glucanase, cellulase, glucosidase, urease, aromatic enzymes), molds (particularly Botrytis 
cinerea) responsible for the noble rot in wines, yeasts and proteins from insects that contaminated the mash. Type 1 allergic 
reactions (positive prick tests) have been described for inorganic components like ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and sulfites, 
but no specific IgE could be detected in the serum. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid, flavonoids (anthocyanins and 
chatechines), sulfites, histamine and other biogenic amines are the main causative agents of intolerance reactions (pseudoallergic 
reactions) to wine. After a short historic review of viticulture and the importance of wine in classical antiquity, we go into the 
chemical processes of alcoholic fermentation and the genetically inherited “flush syndrome” caused by an acetaldehyde 
dehydrogenase 2 polymorphism, subsequently we focus on the different etiologic factors of allergies and intolerance reactions to 
wine. The most frequent intolerance reactions to sulfites occur particularly after the ingestion of white wine and in asthma 
patients. Intolerance reactions to histamine and other biogenic amines occur mainly after ingestion of red wine and in persons 
with diamine oxidase (DAO) deficiency.

Introduction  
Isinglass is a pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of specific tropical 
and subtropical fish, known in the industry as “maws”. Only certain species are selected for 
the isinglass used in brewing. These are certain catfish, croakers and threadfins.  
 
Swim bladders are part of the buoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs 
situated in the dorsal area of the body cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) 
muscles which make up the fish ""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the 
body cavity, thus when the fish are harvested, these swim bladders are readily detached and 
removed from the body of the fish without extr aneous tissue. Because of this, the levels of 
parvalbumin, which is the major allergen in fish and is found mainly in fish muscle, are low. 
Studies using an ELISA test for fish parvalbumin indicate that levels of parvalbumin in the 
swim bladders of those fish used for isinglass manufacture are in the range 7 – 30 mg/kg carp 
parvalbumin equivalents. These levels of parvalbumin are reduced to some extent during 
normal processing to prepare commercial isinglass products but can be further minimised by 
the use of buffer washes. Studies using the ELISA test referred to above indicate that normal 
processing reduces the range of parvalbumin concentrations slightly, but the introduction of an 
extra step of washing with phosphate buffer can achieve a significantly higher reduction. A 
Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, based on HACCP principles, has been developed by 
the BFBi in order to minimise levels of parvalbumin in their commercial isinglass-based 
products and to provide a common quality system for the industry. It is intended as a generic 
industry guide which has been adopted by the manufacturers concerned and has been 
incorporated into each company’s own HACCP system. 
 
Manufacture of isinglass  
 
1. Raw materials – pre-requisites 
 
1.1 Sourcing 
Analysis using the ELISA test has shown that levels of parvalbumin in swim bladders (maws) 
can vary between species. Consequently, only certain species are selected for the 
manufacture of isinglass. These are  
• Arius africanus  (sea catfish) 
• Arius dussumieri (blacktip catfish) 
• Arius maculatus (spotted catfish) 
• Bagrus docmak (bagrid catfish) 
• Bagrus Pseudopimelodus spp Bagre Blanco  (S.American White Catfish) 
• Cynoscions acoupa (Corvina del Lago) 
 
Maws for use by isinglass manufacturers are usually purchased from the same traders that 
supply the food market (the culinary market, for Chinese restaurants and delicatessen 
businesses, accounts for most of the volume of maws traded). These traders must be licensed 
to deal in foodstuffs by the Health Authorities in their respective countries. It is important for 
quality reasons that any maws destined for brewing and other beverage applications are 
cleaned and dried as soon as possible after being removed from the fish. Drying must be at 
ambient temperature in a good airflow without exposure to direct sunlight, which can cause 
damage through overheating (denaturation of the collagen). Great care must be taken during 
drying to avoid damaged by microbial growth.   
 
1.2 Packaging and Traceability Requirements 
The isinglass manufacturers specify that maws should be packed in new, food grade sacks 
and that shipping marks etc should not be sprayed/stenciled on the bags in such a way as to Page 3 of 12 
contaminate the maws inside with paint/ink. Maws should not be contaminated with pesticide 
residues. 
 
To ensure traceability each sack must be marked with  
• Supplier’s identification and lot number 
• maw type (species) 
• net weight 
 
Analytical specifications and visual checks at intake are used by the isinglass manufacturers 
to ensure the quality of their raw materials and that these pre-requisites have been met. 
Samples for pesticide residue analysis are taken after the milling stage of processing. 
 
1.3 Analytical specifications 
The following analytical specifications are set  
• Moisture                   16-22% ideally 17-19% 
• Protein                    >93% 
• Acid Soluble Protein           >90% 
• Collagen                   >88% 
 
 
2. Manufacturing process 
 
Good Manufacturing Practices for the production of Food Grade products are applied 
throughout the entire process. Isinglass products are very heat sensitive. Temperatures in 
excess of 18°C are therefore avoided during the manufacturing process to prevent damage to 
collagen (the active ingredient in isinglass). 
 
A flow diagram for the manufacturing process showing the HACCP Critical Control Points is 
given in Figure 1.  
 
2.1 Visual assessment (Critical Control Point No. 1) 
The outer packaging is removed and the fish maws are placed on a moving conveyor screen 
to remove fine dust particle and other loose material. The conveyor also allows the maws to 
be examined visually and any of doubtful quality to be removed. 
 
Maws are assessed visually to ensure that they are; 
• visually clean and free from infestation 
• free from tissue and fat residues  
• true in shape for the fish species specified 
• whole  
• not discloured (ideally of a pale yellow/straw colour) 
 
Supplier details and fish maw variety are recorded so the source and quality can be traced 
throughout the processing.  
 
2.1 Cleaning (Critical Control Point No. 2) 
The maws are then passed over a screen to remove foreign material such as metal fish hooks 
etc.  
 
2.2 Milling (Critical Control Points No. 3 and 4) 
The maws are first chopped so that they will pass through a 25mm screen. This finer particle 
size has two effects: 
 Page 4 of 12 
• it increases the surface area thus improving the extent of extraction of parvalbumin in 
the subsequent buffer wash 
• it ensures adequate sterilising during the peroxide wash  
 
The chopped product is then sieved to remove fines. The dry isinglass is then stored until 
required for processing. Details of the supplier and fish species are recorded for traceability. 
Metal fragments are removed by magnets, generally positioned between the mill and the 
screens.  
A representative sample of the fine milled material is taken for pesticide residue analysis. 
 
2.3 Sterilising (Critical Control Point No. 5).  
When required for processing, the dry chopped maws are transferred to the wet processing 
area. Here they are first sterilised by soaking in a solution of hydrogen peroxide and soaked 
for a minimum of 16 hours with intermittent stirring at approximately 4 hour intervals. The 
maws are then passed over a fine screen to remove the soluble impurities and fine insoluble 
material with the spent peroxide solution. The isinglass retained on the screen is rinsed with 
water. 
 
2.4  Buffer wash (Critical Control Point No. 6) 
The insoluble isinglass is then soaked in phosphate buffered saline (0.15M NaCl, 0.01M 
Na
2HPO4,pH7) for a minimum of 1 hour, drained, rinsed, then washed twice more with fresh 
water and finally drained. 
 
 This washing cycle removes the parvalbumin (whi ch is readily soluble at pH 7) from the 
isinglass, which is insoluble. The resultant wet isinglass is then further processed to a form 
suitable for the end user.  
 
2.5 Further processing 
Isinglass is sold in 3 different forms. 
1. Powder 
2. Aqueous Paste 
3. Aqueous Liquid. 
As mentioned earlier, for quality reasons it is critical to keep temperature <18 oC to prevent 
isinglass denaturing for both liquids and pastes. 
 
 
Powder: 
After washing, the wet isinglass is dried, either by freeze drying or using a low temperature air 
drier. The dried isinglass is then milled to a powder. It can be sold in this form to the user who 
dissolves it in dilute food grade acid prior to use. Alternatively, it may be blended with a 
powdered food grade organic acid by the isinglass manufacturer and sold to the end user as a 
ready-to-use powder. 
 
Aqueous Paste:   
After washing, the wet isinglass is added to water or to a buffer solution containing approved 
preservatives. This mix is then homogenised to give a fine paste for sale to the end user, who 
dissolves the paste in dilute food grade acid prior to use. 
 
 
Aqueous Liquid: 
After washing, the wet Isinglass is dissolved in dilute food grade acid solution containing 
approved preservatives. The resultant solution is then sold to the end user who further dilutes 
it with water prior to use. Page 5 of 12

1. Executive Summary  
  
This petition is submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers  
Association (BFBi) in support of a request for exemption from the labelling requirements of 
Section 403(w)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass 
when used as a fining/clarification processing aid in beer. This request is being sought on 
the grounds of: 
 
• clinical evidence (Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge) that fish sensitive     
individuals do not have allergic responses to isinglass, even when challenged with very high 
oral doses   
• the manufacturing process for isinglass minimizes allergenic potential  
• extremely low potential for dietary exposure to isinglass through beer consumption  
• long history of safe use  
• absence of published reports of allergenicity   
  
This document presents details on:    
1. composition and characterization of isinglass.  
2. development of an ELISA method for the detection of parvalbumin (the allergenic 
molecule generally associated with fish allergenicity) and it’s use in the 
quantification of parvalbumin in isinglass raw materials (‘fish maws’) and in 
commercially available, processed isinglass products. 
3. development of an ELISA method for the detection of residual isinglass in beer 
together with analytical results for levels of residual isinglass found in commercial 
beers. 
4. a ‘Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Isinglass’ adopted by the major 
producers of isinglass and specifically designed to minimize parvalbumin levels in 
commercial isinglass products. 
5. expected level of consumer exposure to isinglass and associated parvalbumin 
6. comprehensive literature searches was conducted to identify any documented 
instances of confirmed allergenic responses related to isinglass or to beers treated 
with isinglass. 
7. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and double blind placebo  
controlled oral challenge tests), carried out in Denmark and Switzerland and the 
associated protocols used.  
8. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and oral challenge tests),   
carried out in France and the associated protocols used. 
 
 
The scientific studies described herein were conducted during the period 2004-2007 in 
support of a submission by BFBi and The Brewers of Europe for an exemption from Annex 
IIIa of EU Directive 2005/26/EC and thus from the requirement to label isinglass, under 
allergen labelling regulations, when used as a clarifying aid in brewing.   Page 4 of 26 
 
The petitioners note that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered their 
Opinion (adopted on 6th July 2007), concluding that ‘the Panel considers that it is not very 
likely that isinglass used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic reaction in 
susceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use specified’ (Appendix 
11). Isinglass was subsequently granted a permanent exemption from allergen labelling, 
this exemption being granted for both beer and wine (Appendix 11A). 
It is also noted that Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) deliberated on a 
request by the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand, an application subsequently 
taken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand, for the exemption of isinglass from 
allergen labelling requirement when used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. FSANZ 
undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public health and safety implications 
and concluded that since residual isinglass in beer and wine, if present, did not exceed 
1mg/liter of bottled beer or wine and since parvalbumin was demonstrated to co-sediment 
with and thus be removed by sedimentation or filtration then the consumption of isinglass-
fined beer and wine was not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers. FSANZ also deliberated on the wider aspects of such allergen labelling 
requirements, including potential impact on consumer choice, cost to industry, cost to 
Government enforcement agencies, and international trade considerations. FSANZ 
approved an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present 
in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent (Appendix 12) 
It is the position of Health Canada that if an ingredient derived from Canada's priority a food 
allergen source (like a fining agent) is added to a food during its production but later is 
removed from the food, so that it is no longer present in the finished food, then that will not 
trigger the application of Canada’s allergen labelling regulations. This is the situation for 
most commercial wines even where the a  food allergen source of the derived fining agent 
is used is from food considered a priority allergen source (i.e. the priority that the allergen 
food source derived fining agent is added to the wine but later removed by effective 
filtration and is no longer present in the finished wine). The fact that the protein from the 
food allergen is not present in the finished wine means that the use of the fining agent is not 
expected to pose a risk to allergic consumers, and so allergen labelling regulations would 
not be triggered. 
With regards to the use of isinglass in beer, isinglass is derived from the dried swim 
bladders of fish and consists primarily of collagen, which is a protein.  If the isinglass is used 
as a fining agent in the beer but is then removed by filtration or some other method and the 
isinglass is no longer present in the finished beer, then no labelling would be 
required.  Health Canada have taken the view that any protein present in an ingredient 
derived from a priority food allergen source should be regarded as a potential allergen. The 
published studies, including food challenge clinical tests,  clearly indicate that collagen, the 
primary protein in isinglass, does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive individuals. 
It is the opinion of the petitioners that the scientific evidence and conclusions presented 
herein remain valid and, in particular, the clinical studies described remain in line with 
current best practice for assessing allergenic potential of a food substance. Page 5 of 26 
 
The petitioners are supportive of informative allergen labelling. The petitioners 
acknowledge that ‘fish’ is a common cause of allergies and that fish-derived material may 
also contain potential allergens. However, all available published evidence indicates that 
isinglass, when used as a beer fining agent, does not cause an allergic response that poses a 
risk to human health when consumed by fish sensitive individuals.  
  
Isinglass used in brewing is a pure form of collagen (greater than 92% collagen on a  
dry, ash free basis). It is derived from the swim bladders of specific physostomatous  
tropical and sub-tropical fish. In these fish, the swim bladder forms a distinct organ  
which can be readily detached as a discrete entity, and as such is unlikely to be  
contaminated with significant quantities of skeletal muscle (fish meat) or other tissue.  
The isinglass raw material (swim bladders or ‘fish maws’) are processed under defined 
conditions to produce saleable isinglass in various forms (powder, paste or liquid). The dry 
powder form is typically supplied as a blend containing microbiological stabilizer and acid 
required to solubilize the collagen molecules and produce liquid isinglass which is then 
applied in the beer or winemaking process,  
The isinglass solution used in brewing consists mainly of solubilized collagen molecules 
(mostly as dimers and trimers with molecular weights of 800-1300kDa) together with 
lesser amounts of gelatine (denatured collagen), low levels of elastin plus low levels (<5% 
concentration) of other non-collagenous material. Very low levels of material that react in a 
dose-dependent manner in ELISA assay designed to detect Gad c1 parvalbumin (presumed 
to be parvalbumin) have also been identified in isinglass. Unlike many allergens, pepsin 
digestion studies have demonstrated that isinglass is readily and completely hydrolyzed by 
pepsin.   
  
Isinglass is used as a clarifying agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage (typically 
15mg/litre; total range 10-60mg/litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it reacts with 
yeast and proteins, forming large flocs. These flocs are removed from the bulk of the liquid 
by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Residual isinglass levels in treated beers have 
been quantified using an ELISA assay developed to detect residual levels of isinglass in beer. 
Beer as presented to consumers will typically contain levels ranging from 0 – 5.0 mg/litre 
maximum. Brewery-conditioned beers (filtered beers) typically contain less residual 
isinglass than traditional unfiltered British cask beers but results indicate that no types of 
beer contain more than 5 mg/litre.  
Parvalbumin is not detectable in beer, even when isinglass is dosed at rates which are more 
than double the highest known commercial rates.  
  
Although isinglass has been used as a beer clarifying agent for centuries, extensive  
searches of the scientific and medical literature have not identified any documented  
cases of allergic reaction due to isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of  
allergic reactions to isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all,  
is extremely rare.   
  Page 6 of 26 
 
Results from investigation into parvalbumin levels in isinglass products confirm that  
commercial isinglass products may contain parvalbumin at extremely low levels (around 1 
μg/g on dry weight basis). The manufacturing process for isinglass includes several steps 
that are designed specifically to minimize levels of residual parvalbumin in commercial 
products.  
 
Comprehensive clinical studies on the allergenic potential of isinglass have  
been carried out. Oral challenges have demonstrated no allergic reaction in 21 fish  
sensitive individuals when challenged with isinglass at very high rates, despite skin  
prick tests having confirmed that the species of fish used in isinglass production are  
capable of inducing allergic response in some fish sensitive individuals. It should also be  
noted that since the actual residual amounts of isinglass in commercial beers are  
very low, the oral challenge doses equate to extremely high rates of beer consumption  
(greater in some instances than would be physically possible to consume).   
  
BFBi hereby request exemption from the labelling requirements of Section 403(w)(1) of the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass used as a 
fining/clarification aid in beer production on the basis that there is no allergic response 
elicited in fish-allergic individuals consuming beers fined with isinglass, even at 
theoretically impossible levels of beer consumption. 
2. Applicant   
This application is made by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association 
(BFBi). The BFBi, established in 1907, represents the full range of suppliers to the brewing  
and beverage industries, from raw materials through to process equipment, packaging,  
dispense and point of sale.  
 
3. Subject of Petition  
Isinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen; within the context of this petition 
""isinglass"" is used exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim  
bladders of the fish rather than from fish skins. Isinglass used in brewing (and wine) is a 
pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders (known in the industry as  
“maws”) of specific tropical and subtropical fish. Only a restricted range of species  
are used; these are specific catfish, croakers and threadfins.  Swim bladders are part of the 
buoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs situated in the dorsal area of the 
body cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) muscles which make up the fish 
""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the 
fish are processed, these swim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of 
the fish without extraneous tissue. Thus levels of parvalbumin (the major allergen in fish, 
which is associated with fish muscle) would be expected to be low.   
   
ELISA methods have been developed in order to measure the actual levels of parvalbumin 
in the dried fish maws and in the processed isinglass. Details are provided in Section 6 
(Analytical data).    Page 7 of 26 
 
  
Isinglass used in the brewing industry is prepared from fish maws by a defined series of 
processes. The manufacturing process includes a buffer washing stage that is particularly 
efficient at removing the low levels of parvalbumin that might be associated with the raw 
materials. The manufacturing process is described in the ‘Code of Good Manufacturing 
Practice for Isinglass’. Details are provided in Section 4 (Manufacturing process).    
  
Isinglass has been used for several centuries to clarify beer. At the end of the  
primary fermentation beer contains large quantities of yeast and suspended protein  
solids which must be removed from the beer. The contribution from yeast is typically  
in the range 100 to 400 mg/l (dry solids) equivalent to 1x106 to 4x106 cells/ml. Protein  
particles contribute a further 150 to 300 mg/l (dry solids).   
  
After fermentation the beer/yeast mixture is cooled to halt yeast growth. For brewery- 
conditioned beers, isinglass can be added to the beer at this stage. It reacts with the  
flocculating yeast and protein particles, causing them to sediment rapidly at the base  
of the storage vessel, so that the majority can be removed prior to filtration. Once the  
sedimented solids (consisting of isinglass, yeast and protein) are removed, the beer  
can then be filtered, typically through a bed of kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth). High  
speed centrifugation can replace filtration in certain treated beers. The dosage rate of  
isinglass is typically 15 mg/litre for brewery-conditioned beers.  
  
Cask-conditioned beer is a specific style of beer in the UK (sometimes referred to as  
real ale) and represents an important traditional product. In this style of beer the yeast 
remains in the cask, and promotes flavour changes that contribute to the essential character 
of the final product. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer before it is transferred to the cask 
or directly into the cask. The action of isinglass takes place generally within the first 3 to 4 
hours after cask filling so that the flocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) 
rapidly settle to the base of the cask, forming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from 
the cask at a point above the sediment, so that it remains bright, (i.e. no cloudiness) and free 
of suspended particles. Cloudy beer is not acceptable to the consumer in this type of  
product. (It should be noted that there are other styles of beer which are typically  
cloudy, for example, wheat beers: however, these are not fined with isinglass).  
Dosage rates for cask-conditioned beers are typically in the range 35-60 mg/litre.   
   
Since the added isinglass is removed from the treated beer by either filtration, 
centrifugation and/or sedimentation, residual levels in the beer as consumed are expected 
to be very low. Investigations into the actual residues of isinglass remaining in beer have  
been carried out, using a highly sensitive antibody-based method. These studies are 
described in Section 6 (Analytical data).   
Although not the subject of this petition, it is noted that the similarities between the 
application of isinglass in beer and wine, together with scientific studies performed to 
assess the allergenic potential of wine treated with isinglass suggests that it is not likely that 
isinglass-treated wine presents a risk to fish-sensitive wine consumers. (Appendix 12 pp54-
56)  
  
4. Manufacturing process  
  
Isinglass is sold in 3 main forms – powder, paste, and pre-dissolved ‘ready to use’  Page 8 of 26 
 
liquids. Powders are typically pre-blended with dry acid, and often include a source of  
sulfur dioxide in the form of sodium or potassium metabisulfite. Paste is a hydrated form of 
isinglass, typically 10% w/w isinglass, where the particle size has been reduced to less than 
1 mm. ‘Ready to use’ liquids are dilute acidic solutions of isinglass containing between 0.3 
and 1.0 % w/w isinglass. Sulfur dioxide is included as a preservative.  
Studies described in Section 6 (Analytical data) established that the traditional 
manufacturing process could be adapted to minimize the presence of the common fish 
allergen, parvalbumin, in isinglass.  The new manufacturing process for isinglass (Appendix 
1) was implemented by the isinglass manufacturers in 2007 and the process is outlined 
below.   
• Maws are inspected visually at intake to ensure that they are not discolored, are free 
from infestation and are of the specified fish species.   
• Maws are blended by type to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply criteria.  
• Maw size is reduced by granulation (to max 25mm) to facilitate subsequent cleaning 
and sterilization.  
• Granules are sterilized in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution 
• Granules are thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water 
• The sterilized granules are then soaked in a phosphate buffer solution 
• The granules are then thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water  
• The granules are then dried in a controlled environment with temperature not 
exceeding 400C (1040F) 
 
Note that during the wet processing stages a temperature below 150C (590F)is maintained 
and the temperature of acidified liquid ’ready to use’ isinglass is maintained below 10oC 
(500F). 
  
The analytical studies described in Section 6 indicate that low levels of parvalbumin  
can be found in fish maws prior to processing, up to a maximum of around 30 µg/g (mg/kg). 
Fish species with apparently high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladders are not used in 
isinglass production. 
Phosphate buffer, routinely used in clinical studies to extract parvalbumin from fish flesh 
(Lehrer, 1986), is included in isinglass processing to ensure parvalbumin levels are 
minimized. The levels of residual parvalbumin achievable in commercial isinglass products 
are typically below 1 µg/g (mg/kg), on a dry weight basis.  
The detailed industry-agreed Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for isinglass is included 
as Appendix 1.  
 
5. Documented History of Non-allergenicity  
  
Comprehensive literature searches in 2004 by Nerac (a specialist data retrieval company)  
and Dr Steve Taylor of Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP) at the  
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA)  did not identify any reports of allergic  
responses to isinglass or to fish maws (which are widely consumed as a food in their  
own right amongst Chinese ethnic populations). The searches also failed to find any  
reports of allergic responses to beer which could be attributed to the use of isinglass  Page 9 of 26 
 
(of the few reports of allergic responses to beer which were found, most were cereal- 
related ; one was related to the proteolytic enzyme papain, two were related to yeast  
and one was related to an allergy to pollen). Other reports were related to biogenic  
amines, ethanol and ethanol metabolites and sulfites.     
  
This search was repeated in 2007 by Nerac, using the same key words (beer, brewery,  
allergy, non-allergenic, anaphylactic, hypersensitivity) to identify any reports which  
might have been published since 2004. Additional search terms were also used  
(parvalbumin, isinglass).  Again no reports of allergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish 
sensitive individuals were found. The three papers that mentioned ‘isinglass’ or ‘fish maws’.  
  
• Taylor, 2004; was a review article and did not contain any reports of  
allergic responses to either isinglass or to fish maws.   
• Chlup, 2006; reported analysis of isinglass residues in  
beer. This is discussed in section 6.1 (Isinglass residues in beer).    
•Phillips, 2003; was a report for a brewing journal of the allergen

A paper published after the 2007 search was completed, describes double  
blind placebo controlled oral challenge trials with wine clarified with protein fining  
agents (Rolland et al, 2006). The study included 10 fish-allergic patients, who were  
challenged with wine fined with isinglass and with un-fined wine as a control. No  
allergic reactions to the isinglass-fined wine were reported by any of the patients.   
An updated literature search was commissioned in 2025 to see if any new reports were 
published since 2007. The search terms used were the same as previously and the search 
was conducted by Intertek (a global consultancy firm). Across all sources, no documented 
IgE-mediated allergic reactions were attributed to isinglass in beer (or wine), even among 
fish-allergic individuals.

Based on the collective evidence from clinical studies, analytical detection methods, animal 
models, and regulatory reviews, there is no substantiated evidence that isinglass used in 
beer or wine production elicits IgE-mediated allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
Even in cases where in vitro sensitization markers (e.g., skin prick tests or basophil 
activation tests) were positive, no clinical symptoms were observed upon ingestion.

 6. Analytical data  
  
6.1 Isinglass residues in beer  
As described earlier, residues of isinglass in fined beers are low, since the majority of  
the isinglass added is either removed by centrifugation and/or filtration (for brewery-
conditioned beers) or by sedimentation (for cask-conditioned beers). Analysis of isinglass 
residues in beer is problematic, not only because of the low levels, but also because of the 
presence of other unrelated proteins. Published studies where beer has not been 
concentrated prior to analysis have failed to detect any isinglass residues (Chlup, 2006).  
  
 A method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in isinglass treated beers 
can be concentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The  
separated isinglass can then be hydrolyzed to its constituent acids and quantified by  
measuring the content of hydroxyproline, which is an imino acid present in significant  
quantities only in animal collagens. The limit of quantification of this method, that is  
the concentration of isinglass in beer which can be distinguished from background  
levels of hydroxyproline, is 0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry  
weight basis).   
  
This method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which  
could be present in brewery and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine  
whether there is likely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn  
from a position close to the bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be  
marketable, could nevertheless contain significantly higher concentrations of  
isinglass.   
  
The results indicate that isinglass residues in many bottled and canned beers fined with  
isinglass in the brewery are below the limit of quantification of the method. Where  
isinglass could be quantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed  
1mg/litre.  
  
For large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were only slightly  
higher. Residues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional  Page 12 of 26 
 
samples could contain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned (unfiltered) beers, the  
highest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  
  
There was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The  
concentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above  
the level of sedimented material) was marginally higher than in the bulk, but still  
below 5 mg/litre.   
The full report of this investigation is included as Appendix 3.   
 
6.2 Analysis of proteins in source fish, swim bladders, commercial isinglass  
products and beer   
  
6.2.1. Extraction methods and SDS analysis of fish and swim bladders (maws)  
 
The SDS-PAGE band patterns for extracts of fish used as isinglass sources were  
similar to those of other fish, including cod, and all samples showed a clear band at  
12 kDa which is characteristic of parvalbumin. Extracts of swim bladders (maws) did  
not display this characteristic band. However, the presence of parvalbumin could not  
be completely ruled out on the basis of SDS electrophoresis.  
Western Blotting was also carried out on extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders  
(maws) in order to try and confirm the presence or absence of parvalbumin.  
Parvalbumin could be detected in all samples of fish flesh. However, with the swim  
bladders, traces of parvalbumin could be detected in only one sample.   
  
Full details of the experimental methods and results are given in Appendix 4.  
  
  
6.2.2 Residual parvalbumin in swim bladders and in isinglass  
 
 The principal components of isinglass are collagen and elastin, together with  
degradation products of collagen, such as gelatine, which are not major fish  
allergens. Less than 5% of isinglass is non-collagenous material (Hickman et al,  
2000) (Leach and Barrett, 1967a) (Moir et al, 1984).  There is little adherence  
between the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the fish are processed, these  
swim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of the fish without  
extraneous tissue. Thus isinglass would not be expected to contain substantial  
amounts of parvalbumin and no definitive values have been reported in the  
literature. ELISA tests for fish parvalbumins (carp and cod) have therefore been  
developed in order to measure parvalbumin in swim bladders and in commercial samples of  
isinglass and beer.  
  Page 13 of 26 
 
As a preliminary, an investigation into the homology of fish parvalbumins was carried  
out by Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP).  This showed a high degree of 
sequence identity, indicating a high likelihood of IgE cross–reactivity. A full report of the 
homology search is given in Appendix 5.   
  
A restricted number of fish species are used in isinglass manufacture, and  
commercial products are generally made from a blend of species, chosen to provide  
the technological qualities required by the brewer. Preliminary studies on these  
source materials were carried out using an inhibition ELISA test based on carp  
parvalbumin, since the cod parvalbumin ELISA was not yet available. Details of the  
carp ELISA are given in Appendix 6. These tests indicated that low levels of  
parvalbumin could be detected in a range of swim bladders, the starting raw materials for 
isinglass (see Table 1).   
  
These studies also suggested that swim bladders from certain species contained  
more parvalbumin than others. Accordingly it was decided that those species with  
higher levels of parvalbumin which were not otherwise essential in commercial blends  
for functional reasons would no longer be used, and a common list of 6 species was agreed 
by the manufacturers. This species list was incorporated into the Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice described in Section 4.

6.2.3 Minimization of residual parvalbumin in isinglass  
 
Washing with phosphate buffer is a well-recognized technique for extracting  
parvalbumin from fish flesh, and is widely utilized in research studies (Lehrer, 1986).  
Trials were therefore initiated to determine whether phosphate buffer could be used  
to further reduce residual parvalbumin in isinglass products.   
  
Powdered isinglass, prepared using a typical commercial blend of fish species, was  
tested for parvalbumin using the carp ELISA before and after washing with water and  
with phosphate buffer, on the laboratory scale. The results (shown in Table 2)  
indicate that phosphate buffer washing could significantly reduce residual  
parvalbumin. An alternative approach, washing with calcium solutions, had no effect.

scale)

Water wash 3.0 
Phosphate buffer wash 1.4 
Calcium solution wash 5.3 
(Original data – Appendix 6, Table 1.3) 
  
These trials were repeated on a production scale, but using isinglass preparations  
from single sources of fish maws in order to compare the extent of reduction. (As noted 
previously, commercial isinglass products are typically made up of blends from several but 
limited (see above) fish species). Results (given in Table 3) confirmed that washing with 
phosphate buffer could indeed reduce residual parvalbumin on the commercial scale. 
Although not all samples showed a significant reduction, the greatest effects were with 
those samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin. Since commercial isinglass 
products are made from blends of swim bladders from different sources, it appeared likely 
that phosphate buffer washing, if incorporated into the manufacturing process, could 
significantly reduce the range of residual parvalbumin in commercial products.

Following these promising preliminary results, trials were undertaken to optimize the 
washing protocols in order to achieve maximum parvalbumin removal.    
The extent of parvalbumin reduction throughout the manufacturing process was  
then checked again using a sandwich ELISA test based on cod parvalbumin, which had been 
specifically developed for this project (see Appendix 4). The starting material was isinglass 
powder from a typical commercial blend, using the six agreed species. The results (shown in 
Table 4) confirmed that residual parvalbumin can be significantly reduced to around 0.4 
µg/g on an isinglass dry weight basis, a reduction of approximately 4-fold over the original 
level in the raw material.  
  
This processing protocol has subsequently been implemented as a ‘Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice’ by the major isinglass manufacturers, as described in Section 4.

6.2.4  Impact of new manufacturing protocol on residual parvalbumin in isinglass  
 
Residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass products manufactured prior to the 
implementation of the new manufacturing protocol were determined using  
the cod ELISA test (see Appendix 4). The nominal limit of detection of this method is  
0.20 µg/g. The results, shown in Table 5, suggest that the levels of residual  
parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products manufactured prior to the introduction of the 
new manufacturing protocol were in the range <0.2 – 35 µg/g dry weight, but typically less 
than 10 µg/g.

An assessment of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass products 
manufactured according to the new manufacturing protocol demonstrates the effectiveness 
of this new process in reducing parvalbumin residues, with levels typically less than 1 
μ/g.(Table 6).

6.2.5 Residues of parvalbumin in beer  
 
The overwhelming majority of the isinglass added to beer for clarification is removed, 
either by centrifugation and/or filtration (for brewery-conditioned beers) or by 
sedimentation (for cask-conditioned beers).   
  
Using the analytical method described in Section 6.1 whereby any isinglass present is 
concentrated, it has been demonstrated that residues of isinglass in brewery-conditioned 
bottled and canned beers were largely below 0.17 mg/litre (the limit of quantification of the 
method), with the highest concentrations found not exceeding 1mg/litre. For brewery 
conditioned beers in keg, residues did not exceed 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beers, 
the highest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  
  
The analyses described in Section 6.2.4, Tables 4 & 6, indicated that residual parvalbumin  
levels in commercial isinglass products produced using the new protocol described in 
Section 4 would be expected to be less than 1 µg/g. If it is assumed that the parvalbumin in 
isinglass remains associated with it during the fining process, the theoretical maximum for 
residues of parvalbumin remaining in fined beer would be in the range <0.001 – 0.005 
µg/litre. This is illustrated in Table 7.   
  
The measurement uncertainty of the cod ELISA is relatively high. If this is taken into  
account (i.e. measured value + 3 x Standard Deviation), the concentration of  
parvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new production protocol could be  
4 µg/g. This would give a theoretical concentration of parvalbumin of 0.02 µg/litre for  
a “worst case” (i.e. a cask beer with the highest level of isinglass residues detected) .   Page 18 of 26 
 
 These levels of parvalbumin are extremely low and well below the limit of  
determination of the analytical method.

6.2.6 Association of parvalbumin and isinglass during fining of beer  
 
One scenario which needs to be considered is the possibility that parvalbumin (which  
is  known to be soluble in water and dilute salt solutions at neutral and alkaline pH’s)  
could be extracted from isinglass into the bulk of the beer during the fining process,  
rather than partitioning with the isinglass and thus being removed  with it. In this case  
parvalbumin residues in beer could potentially be higher. Chemistry theory suggests that 
this is unlikely, since parvalbumin is not very soluble in acid conditions. The isoelectric 
point (which is the pH at which it is least soluble) of the main isoform of fish parvalbumin is 
generally considered to be around 4.7 (Bugajska-Schretter et al, 2000), with other isoforms 
being around 4.4 (Swoboda et al, 2002). Studies of three species of catfish (although not the 
same species as used for commercial isinglass) found isoelectric points of most isoforms to 
be in the range 4.5 – 4.8 (Focant, et al, 1999).  Beer pH is typically in the range 4.0 – 4.4.  
 
  
The behavior of parvalbumin during the fining process was investigated on a commercial 
scale, using a 2127 hl beer tank.  Isinglass finings (7.7 kg), prepared using historical 
manufacturing protocol, were added, equivalent to a typical commercial finings dose of 36 
mg/litre. Assuming a typical parvalbumin content of 10 µg/g, this would be approximately 
0.36 μg parvalbumin/litre of beer. The sedimented material, which contains isinglass and 
beer proteins, was collected and tested for parvalbumin. The concentration of parvalbumin 
in the sediment (carp equivalents) was found to be 120 μg/litre, suggesting that 
parvalbumin was significantly concentrated in the beer sediment (which is not consumed) 
rather than partitioning into the bulk of the beer (see Appendix 6A).    
   
 Page 19 of 26 
 
Further experiments were conducted using the cod ELISA in order to determine  
whether detectable parvalbumin remained in the beer. A lager and a cask ale were  
fined using isinglass at typical commercial dose rates (10 mg/litre and 40 mg/litre  
respectively), using an isinglass preparation made using the new manufacturing protocol 
with the same blend of fish species, in the same ratios, as the blend used for the clinical 
tests. The clear beer was freeze dried, which achieved a concentration of approximately 22-
fold, and the freeze-dried powder tested for parvalbumin using the cod ELISA. The limit of  
detection achieved by this procedure was equivalent to approximately 9 µg/litre  
parvalbumin in beer. No parvalbumin could be detected in either of the two beers.  
  
 A third beer was dosed with commercial isinglass powder 2 from Manufacturer 1  
(see Table 5), which contained a relatively high concentration of parvalbumin  
(7.32 µg/g as detected with the cod ELISA). The dose rate of isinglass in this  
case was 156 mg/litre, which is 3-4 times the dose rate typically used for beer and  
double the highest dose rate likely to be used commercially. The clear beer was  
freeze dried as before, and the freeze-dried powder analyzed for parvalbumin using the  
cod ELISA.  As before, no parvalbumin could be detected in the beer. Theoretical  
calculation suggested that even this high isinglass dose rate would deliver a  
concentration of parvalbumin of not more than 1.14 µg/litre, still below the limit of  
detection of the method.   
(Original data, Appendix. 7, Table 1).   
   
A further attempt to determine whether parvalbumin could be detected in  
commercially fined beer was carried out using the carp ELISA, which appeared to be  
slightly more sensitive than the cod-based test.   
  
• Two control samples consisted of two commercial brands of beer which had  
not been fined with isinglass.   
• Three trials, consisting of beer which was fined on a commercial scale using  
typical dose rates of commercial isinglass pastes   
  
The control and test beers were concentrated by freeze drying in order to achieve a  
parvalbumin level closer to the lower limit of detection, then analysed for parvalbumin at 
FARRP using the carp ELISA.   The results indicated that the range of “parvalbumin” 
detected in the test beers, after correction for concentration, was similar to, or indeed lower 
than, that in the control. Since the control beer contained no animal products whatsoever, 
this apparent “parvalbumin” must be due to non-specific binding to other components of 
the beer. Such non-specific binding is known to occur with ELISA-based tests and would in 
this case be exacerbated by the concentration of the sample. The conclusion is therefore  
that the beers fined with isinglass contained no detectable parvalbumin (Appendix 6A, 
Part 2)   
 
 Page 20 of 26 
 
7. Exposure data  
  
The studies referred to in Section 6 indicate that if present at all, levels of parvalbumin in  
beers are below the limit of detection, that is, less than 9 µg/litre. Residual parvalbumin 
residues in isinglass manufactured according to the old protocol are typically 10μg/g (dry 
weight basis). The new manufacturing protocol reduces potential parvalbumin residues to 
below 1µ/g (dry weight basis).    
  
Since parvalbumin residues in beer (if present) are too low to measure, potential  
residues have been calculated on a theoretical basis. The assumptions used are:  
  
• The dose rate of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/litre. This is around the highest  
dose rate which would be used commercially for cask beers, and is 2-3 times  
higher than the rate used for most brewery-conditioned beers.  
• Residual parvalbumin level in isinglass products manufactured using the old protocol is  
10μg/g (dry weight basis) cod equivalents.  
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial products manufactured using the new production 
protocol is 1 µg/ (dry weight basis).  
• Parvalbumin co-sediments with isinglass and does not partition into the bulk of  
the beer.  
  
Table 8 shows the maximum potential exposure to parvalbumin which would be 
experienced by a person drinking at a moderate rate (1.5 liters of beer in 2 hours) and a 
heavy drinker (3 liters in 2 hours). It can be seen that the greatest exposure, that is, for a 
heavy drinker consuming beer fined with isinglass manufactured as per the old protocol, 
would be around 0.15 µg parvalbumin in 2 hours. This exposure falls to around 0.015 µg 
when isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing Code of Practice is used.

Even if the parvalbumin did not co-sediment with the isinglass, which appears  
unlikely both on theoretical grounds and from experimental data, the maximum  
theoretical exposure for a heavy drinker would not exceed 0.15 µg in 2 hours when isinglass  
manufactured according to the new manufacturing protocol is used.   
 
8. Pre-clinical data  
  
8.1 Pepsin digestion  
It is recognized that allergenic proteins are frequently resistant to digestion in the gut,  
thus digestibility by pepsin is often used as a parameter for assessing potential  
allergens. The major fish allergen Gad c 1 is comparatively resistant to pepsin  
digestion (Bindslev-Jensen et al., 2003).  
  
Isinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, using a similar approach to that  
widely used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins  
considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). Digestibility of peanut  
allergens was used as a reference. It was found that isinglass was digested  
significantly faster than peanut allergens both at pH 1.2 and pH 2.0. No high  
molecular weight material remained after 2 minutes incubation with pepsin at pH 1.2,  
or 5 minutes at pH 2.0. All low and intermediate molecular weight material was fully  
digested at the end of the 60 minute incubation.  Full details of the experimental  
procedure and results are given in Appendix 8.    
  
  
9. Clinical (human) data  
  
9.1 Preparation of fish extract for clinical studies  
The preparation of extracts of fish suitable for use in clinical studies was based on  
findings from the protein analyses described in Appendix 4. The extracts were  Page 22 of 26 
 
checked for any microbiological contamination as described in Appendix 9.A.  
  
 
9.2. Skin prick tests  
  
9.2.1 Protocols  
FARRP have developed protocols for skin prick testing of fish allergic individuals,  
using extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders from a range of species used as  
source fish for commercial isinglass manufacture. Samples of blood are also taken  
from the individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. The detailed protocols are  
given in Appendix 9.B.  Studies have been carried out at Odense University Hospital in 
Denmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the University of Zurich 
in Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber. 
  
9.2.2 Results  
Studies of 8 patients in Denmark were completed. All 8 of the patients reacted to the fish 
flesh, and 7 out of 8 reacted to the swim bladder extracts, suggesting that fish allergic 
patients in Western Europe would be likely to react to the fish species from which isinglass 
is obtained. Detailed results are given in Appendix 9.D.  
  
9.3 Oral challenge tests – FARRP protocol  
FARRP developed standard protocols for double blind placebo controlled  
(DBPCFC) oral challenge tests, using a commercial sample isinglass (manufactured 
according to the new protocol) as the challenge material. The detailed protocols are given in 
Appendix 9.C. Isinglass at four dose rates (0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg) was administered over a 
total period of 2 hours.  Table 9 shows the amount of beer which these doses of isinglass are 
equivalent to. It is apparent that the cumulative dose over 2 hours substantially  
exceeds the equivalent volume (50.5 liters) of beer which it is physically possible to drink in 
that period of time.

The isinglass used for the oral challenges was prepared using the new manufacturing 
protocols. The parvalbumin content as determined by the two ELISA tests was 1.0 µg/g 
(carp parvalbumin equivalents) and 0.695 +/-0.30 µg/g (cod parvalbumin equivalents).    
  
Oral challenge studies of 15 fish allergic patients were carried out at the same  
centers as, and in conjunction with, the skin prick tests, namely, Odense University  
Hospital in Denmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the  
University of Zurich in Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber.  
Details of these studies are reported in Appendix 9.D.   
 
None of the patients reacted to the oral challenges with isinglass, even at the very highest 
doses administered.   
  
 9.4 Skin prick tests and oral challenge tests, French protocol  
 
Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food challenge trials were also carried out by  
Dr Fabienne Rancé at the Hôpital des Enfants, Allergy and Pneumology, Toulouse,  
in France, using slightly different protocols. These are shown in Appendix 9.E. The  
oral challenge consisted of a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass, in three doses of 2, 6 and 
12 mg isinglass, at 30 minute intervals over a period of 2 hours. In this case the total dose of 
isinglass was equivalent to at least 4 liters of beer fined at the maximum commercial rate, or 
20 liters of typical brewery conditioned beer. It should be noted however, that these trials 
were initiated before it was known that isinglass could contain parvalbumin, thus the 
isinglass used in the challenge contained more parvalbumin (a typical level would be up to 
10 µg/g) than that used in the FARRP protocols.   Page 24 of 26 
 
  
Tests of six patients with fish allergies were completed using these protocols.  
Skin prick tests with positive and negative controls to confirm allergenicity to fish,  
were carried out first. Two out of the six showed positive reactions to the skin prick  
tests, but there were no positive reactions to the oral challenge tests. (See Appendix  
9.F).   
  
  
11. Expert Opinion on the allergenicity of isinglass (FARRP)  
  
Experts at FARRP (the Food Allergy Research and Resource Programme at the  
University of Nebraska, USA) were asked to give an expert opinion on the  
allergenicity of isinglass. This Opinion is included as Appendix 10.  
  
In the view of FARRP, ingestion of isinglass does not present a risk to fish allergic 
individuals. FARRP consider that the very high doses of isinglass used, together with the 
complete lack of allergic reactions, adequately compensate for the fact that the original 
target of 29 patients was not achieved (see Appendix 9D).  
  
Since the oral challenges were carried out with significant quantities of isinglass itself,  
and the amount of isinglass remaining in fined beer is extremely small, it follows that  
drinking beer fined with isinglass is even less likely to present any hazard to fish-allergic 
individuals.  
  
12. Conclusions  
  
Using the analytical methods described in this report, low but variable amounts  
of parvalbumin are shown to be associated with commercial isinglass. These levels can be 
substantially reduced by limiting the species of source fish used and by simple 
modifications to the isinglass manufacturing process. Both of these changes have been 
incorporated into a Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, implemented by isinglass 
producers since 2007.  
  
Despite the possible presence of very low levels of parvalbumin in commercial isinglass 
products, the potential for parvalbumin to remain in beer is extremely low. The actual 
potential amounts of parvalbumin added to beer during fining (and also to wine, the other 
beverage where isinglass is commonly used as a fining agent) are extremely small. Both 
chemical theory and the experimental evidence available suggest that parvalbumin co-
sediments with isinglass and is largely removed from the bulk of the beer. No parvalbumin 
can be detected in beer, even when the isinglass dose levels are substantially higher than 
typical commercial rates. Theoretical calculations indicate that even in a worst case Page 25 of 26 
 
scenario the amount of parvalbumin which could be consumed in a few hours even by a 
heavy drinker of beer is in the order of 0.1-0.2 µg.  
Repeated literature searches confirm that there have been no published reports of  
allergic reactions which could be attributed to isinglass or parvalbumin in beer. An oral 
challenge trial reported in the literature, using wine fined with isinglass, also showed  
no allergic responses amongst fish-allergic subjects.   
Clinical trials were carried out in order to define the allergenic status of isinglass. These 
trials included both skin prick tests, using extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders, and oral 
challenge tests, using isinglass administered at high rates. 
The doses of isinglass administered are equivalent to extremely high rates of beer 
consumption. In total twenty-one patients were tested (15 using the FARRP protocol and 6 
using the Rancé protocols). No subjects displayed any objective allergic responses on 
ingestion of very high levels of isinglass.   
In conclusion, the scientific and clinical evidence available indicates that drinking  
beer fined with isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in fish sensitive individuals.   
It also seems highly likely that the use of isinglass in wine production, which uses the same 
isinglass products as used in beer, with wine being similarly clarified by filtration, is also 
not very likely to pose a risk of allergic reaction in susceptible individuals

Re: TTB‐2025‐0003: Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The French Federation of Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), appreciates the opportunity to submit comments 
on Notice No. 238 relative to Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FEVS is the trade association representing the wine and spirit exporting companies of France. FEVS's 
membership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with 
exports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for 
French wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). 
 
FEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American 
consumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and 
quality of the wines and spirits they purchase. 
 
Therefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on the TTB’s proposed rulemaking. 
 
 
On allergen labelling for distilled spirits 
 
FEVS warmly welcomes the proposed approach taken by TTB not to require allergen labelling for distilled 
spirits. This rightly acknowledges the fact that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in a product which 
has been going through a distillation process. It also ensures coherence with the approach already adopted 
by TTB regarding the gluten-free labelling of distilled products. 
 
 
On processing aids and fining agents 
 
FEVS appreciates the possibility for isinglass and fish gelatin, which could be used as fining agents in the 
wine production process, to only label “fish” as the name of the allergen, without being required to indicate 
the fish species used to make the product. 
 
Nevertheless, FEVS would like to share concerns about the proposal made by TTB to require the disclosure 
of processing aids derived from major food allergens on label . As rightly pointed out in the Notice,  this 
proposal should negatively impact wine products since albumen, isinglass or casein are usually used as fining 
and/or clarifying agents for wines. 
 
2 
All of the nine substances considered as “major food allergen” under TTB proposed Notice (with the 
exception of soybean which  is subject to lesser standards ) are part of a list of food or ingredients which, 
according to Codex Alimentarius 1, “shall always be declared as allergenic food using the specified name in 
addition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food” (bold added). 
 
This has to be read in conjunction with the Codex definition of a processing aid
2 which is “ a substance or 
material, not including apparatus or utensils, and not consumed as a food ingredient by itself, intentionally 
used in the processing of raw materials, foods or its ingredients, to fulfil a certain technological purpose during 
treatment or processing and which may result in the non‐intentional but unavoidable presence of residues 
or derivatives in the final product” (bold added). 
 
In addition, most of the operators using fining or clarifying agents  proceed to filtration of their wine before 
bottling to ensure the limpidity of the product as well as the complete removal of any allergenic substance, 
in line with good manufacturing practices. 
 
While acknowledging the necessity to rightly inform consumers on the presence of all allergens derived from 
major food allergens in the final product, FEVS kindly requests TTB not to require the labelling of processing 
aid when producers have followed good manufacturing practices and/or international standards relating to 
the management of allergen in the food production process, such as the Codex Alimentarius Code of practice 
on food allergen management for food business operators (see here) or the OIV Code of good fining practices 
for wine to be applied in the use of proteinaceous wine fining agents with allergenic potential (casein and egg 
white) (see here). 
 
Adopting a diverging approach from international standards could lead to the creation of access market 
barriers, not only for foreign operators willing to export their products to the US but also for US producers 
exporting their wines to foreign markets. For instance, according to EU harmonized rules, all food products, 
including alcoholic beverages, put on the EU market have to indicate  “any ingredient or processing aid (…) 
used in the manufacture or preparation of a food and still present in the finished product, even if in an altered 
form”
3 (bold added). 
 
 
On the wording of the labeling statement and other mandatory disclosures 
 
FEVS encourages TTB to require the use of the terms “ Contains” (followed by a colon and the name of the 
food source from which each major food allergen is derived) rather than “Contains Major Food Allergens”. 
 
As long as only some allergens would fall under a compulsory requirement of disclosure for alcoholic 
beverages, FEVS does not consider such indication would be confusing or misleading for US consumers. 
 
On the contrary, adopting the terms “ Contains” would increase the legibility  and understandability of the 
alcoholic beverages label for US consumers by using  the same terms as those already required  for other 
health-sensitive ingredients (FD&C Yellow No.5, carmine…) when used in spirits or wine products , including 
allergen like sulfites which is present and labelled in the overwhelming majority of wines sold on the US 
market. 
 
This approach would also build on consumers’ habits and purchasing behaviors by ensuring consistency with: 
- current commercial practices used by alcoholic beverages operators who voluntarily label major food 
allergens according to the 2006 TTB Interim rules, 
- alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA and FALCPA rules, 
- other food products sold on the US market. 
 
1 See Point 4.2.1.4 of the General Standard for the labelling of pre -packaged foods CXS 1 -1985: “4.2.1.4 The following foods and 
ingredients are known to trigger food allergy or coeliac disease and shall always be declared as allergenic foods using the specified 
name in addition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food:” 
2 See Point 2 « Deﬁnitions » of the General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods CXS 1-1985 
3 See article 9.1 (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers 3 
In addition, requiring the use of the terms “ Contains” will guarantee the alignment of US rules for alcoholic 
beverages with international standards applying to all food products, as agreed in the 2024 revised Codex 
Alimentarius General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods4. 
 
This would be of great importance, for economic operators as well as US consumers, considering the growing 
number of countries across the world which require to label either the full list of ingredients (as it is the case 
in the EU for wine products) or, at least, allergens on alcoholic beverages packaging  (as it is the case in the 
EU for all alcoholic beverages). 
 
For the same reason, and in line with our preference for using the terms “Contains”, FEVS would welcome 
the possibility for operators to choose how to label major food allergen s on their packaging either by a 
specific “Contains” statement or by their inclusion within a list of ingredients . This will allow operators to 
rightly inform consumers without having to change their packaging whatever the TTB will ultimately decide 
regarding ingredient listing for alcoholic beverages (see Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237 ), but also 
when providing the list of ingredients on a voluntary basis according to US currently applying rules. 
 
It's also the reason why FEVS requests TTB not to mandate specific placement, type size or presentation 
requirements for the indication of major food allergens beyond what it is already required for the sulfites 
statement. This should include the possibility for operators either to make two separate statements (one for 
the food major allergen, the other one for sulfites) or to gather all of them  in one single statement, as long 
as legibility requirements are fulfilled.  
 
All the above elements will also enable operators to manage the limited space available on label to include 
such requirements, while ensuring clear, not misleading and accurate information to US consumers. 
 
 
On the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations 
 
FEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion of a statement of major food allergens. 
 
In addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to 
put on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force 
of any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. 
 
Last but not least, if TTB decides to adopt a final rule on Alcohol Fact Statements for alcoholic beverage (as 
envisaged in Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237), FEVS ask s for an identical date of entry into force 
for both regulations. This will prevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost 
this approach could have for them, especially considering the overwhelming majority of SMEs in the sector.

COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATION  
G/TBT/N/USA/2183 and G/TBT/N/USA/2182 
Allergen and Nutrition Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States 
of America for providing the opportunity to comment on the draft “ Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ”, notified on 22 
January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2183.  
The mandatory labelling of ‘Major Food Allergen’ referred to in the US proposed 
rulemaking includes fish ingredients. The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required 
when the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify 
wines and beers. 
At a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the 
exposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert 
Committee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the 
European Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an 
established history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the 
reference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of 
exposure for derivative safety assessment. 
The EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or 
fish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen 
labelling. 
As regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, 
the EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines 
on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-
2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars 
included in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to 
highlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory 
indication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, 
contrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated 
on traded alcoholic beverages. 
Finally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed 
5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the 
operators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before 
the proposed rule comes into effect.

The EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comments could be taken into 
account and replied to before adoption of the notified draft.

Comment on TTB Notice No. 238 – Proposed Revisions to Malt Beverage Labeling 
and Advertising Regulations
Subject: Public Health Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Alcohol 
Labeling Transparency
Dear TTB,
As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 238. 
I strongly support TTB’s efforts to modernize and improve the transparency of malt 
beverage labeling. Accurate, standardized, and easily accessible labeling is critical for 
informing consumer decisions and reducing alcohol-related harms.
However, I am concerned that the proposed reliance on QR codes as a means of 
conveying essential product information—such as ingredients, nutritional content, and 
allergens—is inadequate from a public health standpoint.
Key Public Health Concerns with the QR Code Approach:
1.Limited Access and Equity: Not all consumers have smartphones, reliable 
internet access, or the technological literacy to use QR codes. This 
disproportionately affects older adults, lower-income populations, and rural 
communities, creating inequitable access to vital health information.
2.Reduced Transparency at Point of Purchase: Important health information 
should be immediately visible to consumers when they are making purchasing 
decisions. Relegating this data to a QR code discourages real-time engagement 
and undermines informed choice.
3.Inconsistent Use by Industry: Without mandatory formatting and content 
requirements, the use of QR codes could become inconsistent across brands, 
further confusing consumers and limiting usefulness.
4.Consumer Expectation of On-Label Information: Unlike most other packaged 
food and beverages, alcohol products are still not required to provide basic 
nutritional or ingredient data directly on the label. Continuing this practice via QR 
codes perpetuates a harmful double standard.
Recommendations:
To align alcohol labeling with broader public health goals, I respectfully urge the TTB to:
•Require on-label disclosure of key information: alcohol by volume (ABV), 
ingredient lists, common allergens, calories per serving, and nutritional 
information.2
•Limit the use of QR codes to supplemental information only, not as a 
substitute for on-label transparency.
•Establish mandatory labeling standards across the alcohol industry to promote 
consistency and prevent consumer confusion.
Consumers deserve to know exactly what they’re consuming—clearly, consistently, and 
equitably. Thank you for considering this public health perspective.

RE Notice No.os 237 & 238 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages; and Major Food
Allergen Labeling for Wineso Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages
Comments of the Kentuckv Distillers' Association
Dear Director,
We are outside counsel for the Kentucky Distillers' Association, located in
Frankfort, Kentucky (""KDA""). The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits
producers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and
its membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on
potential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.
While the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two
notices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit
comments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise
similar concerns for Kentucky's spirits industry. Please accept the following as the
KDA's comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket
TTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to
require the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of
distilled spirits.
Since the KDA's founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and
responsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky's signature Bourbon and Distilled
Spirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world's
supply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As
such, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and
administrative impact on our members.

1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers
The KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs
associated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft
producers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to
distilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff
and capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be
an expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping
units (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued
testing would be cost prohibitive.
It is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated
to be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits
labels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic
and logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive
packaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real
estate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them
ignore key labeling information altogether.
2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion
The proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces
redundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by
volume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the
requirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further
by requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,
which will result in customer confusion.
Customers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being
quantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on
the Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of
alcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or
misinterpret the label entirely.
Further, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes
proteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed
Alcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in
the product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer
would reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that
there are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.

The KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due
to the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.
3. Digital Labeling Options
Spirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As
discussed, to keep consumers' attention and give them the ability to learn more about
certain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such
an approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy
'click through' for the latest and more in-depth product information.
Moreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for
printing new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant
environmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost
ninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for
helping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less
environmental effects.
4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process
As TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -
including gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a
proper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled
spirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the
exception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled
spirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced
post-distillation.
The KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption
regarding TTB's testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-
case basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself
by requiring lab analysis of every product.
If the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final
rulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due
to the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation
product. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause
tremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be
'gluten-free' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about
gluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill
information or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.
Including more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI

potential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential
customers.
5. Conclusion
As TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to
consider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations
that consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and
other spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are
already well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing
more than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing
inefficiencies.
Sincerely,
RRIS

Notification G/TBT/N/USA/2183 
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Introduction 
spiritsEUROPE represents the interests of the European distilled spirits industry. Our members include 
31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base 
in Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion 
in 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United 
States. 
 
We would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Major Food Allergen Labeling 
for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ” to the WTO TBT Committee . We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if 
needed.  
 
I. Comments on “Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages” 
 
spiritsEUROPE very much welcomes the approach taken by TTB on allergens labelling for distilled 
spirits. As the Notice rightly points out, the production of spirits involves the distillation of raw 
materials in such a way that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the distilled product or 
distilled ingredient. It is therefore appropriate that the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply 
to major food allergens used before the distillation process. 
 
We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing protein are added 
to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food allergens are listed on the label. 
 
For those products where the presence of allergens would have to be disclosed , spiritsEUROPE  
welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. In addition, we  would like to request the 
possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before the proposed 
rule comes into effect. 
 
Finally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking  Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into

This letter presents comments of the National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB)' on the Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
(TTB) Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed rules cited above. NFIB finds it
hard to understand why the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management
and Budget continue to pursue these Biden Administration proposals that would place
heavy and unwarranted burdens on the small businesses of America in the beer, wine,
and spirits industry. NFIB recommends and requests that the Treasury Department
withdraw both Biden proposals.

1. The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses
That Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust

Census Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that
small businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the
beer, wine, and spirits industry:

Line of Number of Firms That Had

Business Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage
Breweries 3,214 2,609 81%
Wineries 3,576 2,975 83%
Distilleries 760 659 86%

In the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and
Spirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than
6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.
The report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the
number of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has

grown dramatically but still occupies only a small share of the market.’ Thus, the
Government's own data makes clear that, when the Treasury Department aims new
labeling requirements at the beer, wine, and spirits industry, it hits primarily small
businesses.5 The two Biden-proposed rules fail to recognize the practicalities of
running small businesses and fail to make the adjustments for small businesses that the
congressional policy stated in the Regulatory Flexibility Act contemplates.®

Small businesses, unlike the corporate behemoths in the beer, wine, and spirits industry
whose names and fortunes most everyone knows, cannot afford the bevy of lawyers
and experts necessary to decipher the rules and physically implement them, let alone
afford the cost of changes in processing and machinery to accommodate them.
Regulatory compliance costs small business owners time and money, both of which are
generally in short supply as they strive to keep their small businesses going, meet their
customers’ needs, and create jobs. The Biden-proposed rules would impose
unaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive
barrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in
the industry who can.

The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
fail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared
that “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities
has in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,

Rule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at

§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,
sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,
differing views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,
moral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these
questions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and
spirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound
science and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.
NFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits
have available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage
environments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out
to Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-
alcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the
guidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at
https:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-

discouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress
also noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated
businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to
inefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some
cases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental
and economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules
simply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately
dismisses it.®

President Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the
country’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:

My Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built
on common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators
first. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade
practices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°

To help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting
red tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

2. TTB Did Not Get the President's Deregula’ Message

President Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they
should seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.

On January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days
after TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule
and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order
14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The
ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on
the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic
growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He
also said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private

8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB
considered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is
not proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of
the proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who
are allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a
permanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage
labels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such
products.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all
pseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to
combat.

® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).
expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic
prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”
He emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate
unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°

On February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring
Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government
Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should
identify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that
impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”
and “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private
enterprise and entrepreneurship.”*'

On April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-
Competitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not
predetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that
reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they
create for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed
agency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...
distortions on the operation of a free market.”!2

These are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though
improperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive
Suggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,
issued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.

To comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the
quoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-
proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the
Department of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to
the specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head
of TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that
unreasonably burden small and other businesses.

3. These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record

TTB says'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a
recommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in
the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits '4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a
February 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)'®
joined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or
together, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-
proposed rules.

Regarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes'® the Executive Summary at
the front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,
such as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been
implemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB
should revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory
information on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In
between the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the
report, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the
recommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by
commenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report
recommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the
recommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient
labeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was
therefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen

The CSPI letter of February 24, 2021, represented the view of seven organizations that
exist to advocate particular views, in this case not favorable to the beer, wine, and
spirits industry: CSPI, Alcohol Justice, American Institute for Cancer Research,
Consumer Federation of America, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, National
Consumers League, and U.S. Aicohol Policy Alliance. Advocacy to the federal and
state governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by
the First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state
constitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a
complete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.

4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails
Legal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue
the rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the
benefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to
impose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only

no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.”); NFIB v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)

Congress has provided."").

2 27 U.S.C. 205(e). The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of
title 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.
205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,
to provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the
product, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the
authority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,
analyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the
case of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the
State into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at
5764, col. 1.
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major
allergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements
of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep
(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things
that are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or
importer -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,
applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that
Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”
unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen
labeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue
the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.

Second, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains
Major Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in
fact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that
TTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits
with its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech
that is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,
distilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in
the production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major
allergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the
allergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility
in exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if
the allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°
If an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but

none of the allergen in the process ends up in the final product -- confirmed, if
necessary, by appropriate analysis of periodic test samples?’ -- the rule should not
require a label stating that the bottle “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” just because a
major allergen was used at some point in the production process.”

Third, TTB failed to calculate the costs of compliance of the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule. To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:

... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the
cost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry
members would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the
Alcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new
allergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just
one label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°

The TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business
assuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling
Rule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal
duty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and
must consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°
TTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes
of the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a
final Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not
an Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,
but not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to
comply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603

Given the serious shortcomings of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, the
Treasury Department should withdraw the proposed rule.

5. The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails
Legal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the
rule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and
Executive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by
law.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury
Department claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)
chapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)
section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant
the authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration
proposed.

Of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only
three provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)
REQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the
revenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits
issued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,
sale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5
wine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section
5368 provides:

(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and
gauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such
manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).

22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has
no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.

(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,
vehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with
this chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

Section 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or
sale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled
in such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be
removed from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled
spirits plants under section 5222.”

The three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.
Section 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for
distilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.
Section 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the
comparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different
from marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to
impose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of
labeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also
that the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to
labeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the
Internal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by
volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412
grants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.
Accordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue
Code to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or
beer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.

The Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol
Facts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements

34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in
one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that
Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).
12

of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the
requirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,
alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.
Also, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes
that Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic
significance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant
alcohol facts labeling authority.

The Treasury Department's triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for
Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2
(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which
it can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide
consumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court
decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.
Circuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional
predecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,
there is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates
Congress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient
disclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of
discretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,
as necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with
that congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the
agency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,
104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme
Court rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which
the Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its

3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were
defined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to
authorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.

meaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their
independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory
authority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9

So, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that
leaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.
Congress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when
it wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”

Second, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little
benefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost
the industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement
(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent
years for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has
no reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to
purchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without
admitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them
to purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling
requirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they
otherwise would have faced.

As for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of
alcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to
quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in
the absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”
assuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.
In the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule:

TTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but
as stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide
consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of
alcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice

about moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional
information about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.

The first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a
thread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts
labeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would
mean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but
carbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.
Also, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery
store), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in
a bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it
might be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts
label diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with
respect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the
Alcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to
compare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a
higher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should
take human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on
assumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

The second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
provide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient
content of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the
proposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing
the additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the
labeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the
labeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.

For the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
greatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.

Thirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-
proposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”

4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information
requirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per
container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of
legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in
a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better
for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who
are pregnant.”).

47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or
any other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a
notice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United
15

TTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5
“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And
immediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
But that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to
the proposed rules.

n

The data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises
(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in
this case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the
proposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account
of recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is
$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298
per year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the
Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making
about $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed
charge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.

Particularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its
decision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities:

The production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an
industry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and
advertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding
more elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant
impact on the regulated industry.°!

The TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding
more labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential
policy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.

NFIB recommends and requests that the Department of the Treasury withdraw the rules
on Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed by the Biden Administration three
days before he left office. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the
Department of the Treasury has no legal authority to promulgate the Biden-proposed
rules and failed to provide the regulatory analyses required in proposing the rules. And
the proposed rules run flatly contrary to the deregulatory policies President Trump has
established by executive order. Withdrawal of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling
and Alcohol Facts rules will prevent imposition of unwarranted, burdensome, and costly
rules on small businesses in the beer, wine, and spirits industry.

Consumers with food allergies have no way of knowing if they can safely consume alcoholic beverages because neither ingredient lists, nor major allergen labeling is required. Nearly all foods and beverages we consume are required to have basic labeling of ingredients and allergens. Alcohol shouldn't be exempt!I commend TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and protect consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the top 9 major food allergens that does not exempt processing aids. The rule could be strengthened by specifying where the allergen disclosure should appear, outlining specific formatting requirements, and requiring species specific disclosure for the labeling of fin fish. TTB should make clear in the final rule that this information should never be provided solely via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology Consumers need this information as soon as possible!

But here's the thing — they're removed before bottling. They don't end up in the finished wine in any meaningful or measurable way. If I had to put ""egg"" or ""milk"" on a label when neither is actually in the bottle, a lot of people would assume they're drinking something they're not. That's misleading, not helpful. On top of that, the average consumer isn't familiar with winemaking terminology. Words like ""bentonite,"" ""potassium caseinate,"" or ""isinglass"" can sound scary on a label with no explanation.

From a practical standpoint, wine labels are already packed with required information — varietal, vintage, appellation, health warnings, alcohol content, government statements — and there's only so much space to work with. Every time you add something new, something else has to give. And for small producers, redesigning labels is expensive and time-consuming. If the TTB truly wants to make this information available, there are better ways. A QR code or a note directing people to a website would allow producers to share details for specific vintages without constantly redesigning labels. That keeps the information accurate and avoids scaring off customers with technical terms they may not understand. At the end of the day, this proposal feels like a solution in search of a problem.

We respect TTB's mission to ensure consumer safety and transparency, but must respectfully oppose the proposed mandatory allergen labeling regulations for alcoholic beverages. Our position is supported by substantial scientific evidence and international standards demonstrating the following: 1. Standard Winemaking Practices Effectively Remove Allergenic Proteins • Multiple scientific studies confirm that when wines are produced using good manufacturing practices, including fining followed by bentonite or sheet filtration and sterile filtration, allergenic proteins (e.g., from egg, milk, fish) are removed to undetectable levels (typically <0.1mg/L by ELISA assays). • Wines tested after such treatments routinely show no detectable allergenic residues, and provocation tests on sensitive individuals consistently show no clinical reactions. • The Organization International de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV) recommends a detection threshold below which labeling is unnecessary, in line with outcomes showing no risk in finished wine. 2. Risks to Allergic Individuals Are Negligible with Commercial Practices • Clinical challenge studies (double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) on wines produced with egg white, casein, or fish gelatine failed to elicit reactions in highly sensitive individuals, validating that finished wine poses extremely low risk of anaphylaxis related to such allergens. • In rare cases where trace residue was measurable, oral challenge studies involving up to 200mL wine showed no reaction in sensitized subjects. 3. Mandatory Labeling Is Disproportionate and Might Mislead Consumers • Required labeling of allergens that do not exist in meaningful quantities in the finished product could cause unnecessary alarm and reduce consumer confidence in otherwise safe products. • European and Australian regulators have adopted risk-proportionate approaches, requiring labeling only if residues exceed specific scientific thresholds. 4. Disproportionate Cost to Small Producers and Rural Communities • The costs of compliance—label redesign, legal consultation, and ongoing analytical testing of finished wine—present a severe financial burden to small rural wineries, threatening not only their viability but also significant rural economic benefits. • These costs are unjustified given the lack of evidence for public health benefit in properly produced commercial wine. Conclusion Scientific research and international regulatory experience demonstrate that potential allergenic proteins are reliably removed through standard winemaking techniques, resulting in products that do not pose a significant risk to sensitive individuals. We therefore urge TTB to align with global best practices and scientific evidence, limiting mandatory allergen disclosure to cases where validated laboratory methods can detect residues above internationally accepted thresholds.

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA. We are dedicated to advancing evidence-based policies that promote public health and safety. We are writing in response to the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)’s request for comment on rulemaking around allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages (27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7; Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238).  We applaud TTB’s intention to improve the transparency and safety around alcoholic beverages. As a consumable product, alcohol is often unaccountably exempt from the consumer information requirements of other foods and beverages. This proposed rulemaking will close the gap.  Food allergies are not a rare condition. Approximately 11% of U.S. adults are estimated to have a food allergy (around 26 million), and 38.3% of those individuals have had an allergy-related emergency department visit.1 Of those with a food allergy, 90% are allergic to one of 9 major food types.2 Alcohol use is common in the United States, with 177.3 million residents ages 12 and up consuming alcohol in the past year. Depending on the nature of the alcohol product, many will very often contain one or more of the 9 major allergens (e.g., the grains used to make beer almost inevitably introduce wheat gluten to the finished product), while for others the presence of an allergen can be difficult to know for certain (e.g., distilled spirits) and in some cases un-anticipatable (e.g. the use of fish-derived products in wine production). Allergic events create a steady financial drain. In a systematic review of allergen economic impact studies, individual medical costs from allergen-related causes amount to an average of $2,081 per event, while household costs exceed an average of $8000 per event from out-of-pocket expenses and opportunity costs.3 As such, avoiding unexpected exposures to allergens in alcohol consumption could have a significant health and economic benefit to U.S. households.  To be most effective in addressing these concerns, the TTB rulemaking should err on the side of consistency across labels. That means minimizing the alternatives to the “Contains major food 
allergens” wording, even if said alternative wording is considered by the producer to be more emphatic. Consumers become accustomed to looking for allergen information in particular places with particular words. Along these same lines, the “minor” allergens should be consistently identified in the same place and same formatting as major ones. The warning should be high-visibility, including a minimum font size, restrictions on kerning and compressing, a mandated box, and contrasting background within that box.  We would advise against allowing allergen labeling exemptions for distilled products, because cross-contamination is a known and described phenomenon across food production. TTB could consider a warning akin to the “made in a facility that also processes” language commonly used in food product warnings, however it’s not clear that this complexity actually does producers a favor. It is less impactful to err towards an unnecessary label than to induce a medical event.  On-label warnings are an absolute requirement. QR codes are not universally sought out or employed, and the required access to the internet is not always available.4 Moreover, not all packaged alcohol will be consumed in circumstances where the consumer will be expected to have mobile device with them. Allergen information should be as available beachside as it is in the grocery store, and the only way to ensure this is to include the information directly on the packaging.   As a final note—we join with the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and other groups in urging TTB to require full ingredient labeling for all products. While the allergen warnings are important to prevent acute medical events, there are many other reasons to avoid or seek out certain ingredients, including ethical and religious grounds. We also support CSPI’s request for an accelerated, 3.5–year timeline—the concerns from industry in ramping up the testing for products should be offset by the acclimation time required by the public to begin reflexively seeking allergen information on the labels.   We thank TTB for their long-term effort in developing and promulgating these new guidelines. Alcohol Justice is available at the Bureau’s request for any further information or context to help bring this rulemaking to fruition.     Respectfully,

To Whom It May Concern, 
 
GS1 US appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau's (TTB) proposal to require disclosure of major food allergens used in the production 
of alcohol beverages. As an organization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US 
understands the importance of leveraging data and technology to improve transparency and 
enhance consumer access to detailed product information that supports informed decision making. 
We commend TTB’s commitment to these goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute 
our insights. 
 
For over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver 
safe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC 
barcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners 
identify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions 
of businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 
members across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage 
production, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. 
 
As a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify 
industry challenges and to build consensus on best practices for solving them using global 
standards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global 
standards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards 
help empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access 
to the information they want and need about those products. 
 
2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Allergen Labeling 
GS1 US acknowledges the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with 
essential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, 
particularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid 
in achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as UPC barcodes, can only hold a limited 
amount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of 
storing much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates,  
 
www.gs1us.org  2 
and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing comprehensive 
information in a compact format. 
 
The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and consumer value of 
digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform launched in 2015 to 
provide detailed product information via QR codes. Incorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global 
Trade Item Number (GTIN) can effectively support consumer access to allergen information. This 
approach promotes consumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. 
Additionally, 2D barcodes can serve as a valuable complement to the information required to 
appear on the physical label.  Besides the required on-pack disclosures, 2D barcodes provide a 
pathway to more detailed information, such as ingredient lists, sustainability practices, and 
responsible consumption messaging, enhancing transparency for consumers. 
 
A GS1 Digital Link-enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and 
allergen information, including dynamic data including recalls or safety alerts, through a simple 
smartphone scan. The GS1 Digital Link standard enhances the power and flexibility of GS1 
identifiers by integrating them into the web. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into 
gateways to consumer information, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand 
loyalty while improving supply chain traceability. 
 
Moreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up label space. 
QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater capacity for 
information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing comprehensive data. 
Furthermore, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already familiar with 
scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American adults use 
smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said they would scan a QR code to access 
product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers consumers to 
easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. 
 
In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and allergen information, 2D barcodes 
encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and interoperable format, ensuring accuracy 
and consistency across retail and digital platforms. Including the GTIN in a QR code encoded with 
GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product information.  
 
Application of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information 
GS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification 
and efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open, global standards can 
significantly enhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be 
applied to support industry compliance with allergen labeling requirements: 
 
1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, 
parties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the 
manufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to 
recognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information.  
 
www.gs1us.org  3 
2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies 
such as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical 
information like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate 
capture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. 
3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data 
formats allows for seamless information exchange across the supply chain. This 
transparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their 
confidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by 
facilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. 
 
Conclusion 
Incorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN for product identification, 2D barcodes, and 
GS1 Digital Link into the TTB’s allergen labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance 
consumer access to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only enable industry 
stakeholders to efficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future 
advancements in the digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively 
with TTB, industry partners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of 
this important initiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the 
opportunity to contribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol 
beverage products.

  INTRODUCTION   Almost  two  decades  ago,  TTB  issued  an  interim  rule  addressing  voluntary  labeling  of  major  food  
allergens.
 
Some
 
craft
 
spirits
 
producers
 
followed
 
suit
 
and
 
began
 
adding
 
additional
 
information
 
for
 
the
 
consumer.
  
TTB’s
 
current
 
proposal,
 
which
 
seeks
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
voluntary
 
program
 
mandatory,
 
is
 
generally
 
accepted
 
by
 
the
 
American
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Association
 
(ACSA)
 
for
 
the
 
reasons
 
set
 
forth
 
below.
  
If
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
to
 
notice
 
the
 
consumer
 
of
 
ingredients
 
most
 
often
 
associated
 
with
 
food
 
allergies,
 
however,
 
ACSA
 
suggests
 
an
 
approach
 
led
 
by
 
“The
 
simpler
 
the
 
better”.
  
  
Allergen  Statements  
A.  Labeling  of  Major  Food  Allergens  and  other  Mandatory  Disclosures   
1  
1.  Wording  of  the  Labeling  Statement  and  Other  Mandatory  Disclosures  
 
1.1.  Should  TTB  adopt  the  proposed  wording  of  the  major  food  allergen  
statement
 
(""Contains
 
major
 
food
 
allergen(s)""
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
colon
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived)?
 
Alternately,
 
should
 
TTB
 
require
 
or
 
allow
 
alternative
 
formats,
 
including
 
the
 
following:
 
 
1.1.1.  ""Contains""  followed  by  a  colon  and  the  name  of  the  food  source  
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived;
 
or
 
 
1.1.2.  A  heading  such  as  ""Major  Food  Allergen  Information""  followed  by  
""Contains:""
 
or
 
other
 
language
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived.
 
All  of  these  options  effectively  communicate  the  desired  information.  We  
encourage
 
TTB
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
briefer
 
options,
 
such
 
as
 
“Contains:
 
Nuts”
 
A  consumer  who  needs  this  information  will  know  what  to  do  with  it.  They  don’t  
need
 
to
 
be
 
told
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
major
 
allergen
 
information-
 
they
 
know
 
they’re
 
allergic
 
to
 
nuts.
 
1.2.  Should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  food  allergens  within  a  voluntary  
ingredient
 
statement
 
on
 
labels
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
 
 
Yes.
 
1.3.  If  mandatory  ingredient  labeling  is  ultimately  adopted,  should  TTB  allow  the  
inclusion
 
of
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
ingredients
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
If
 
mandatory
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
is
 
ultimately
 
adopted,
 
should
 
TTB
 
use
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA’s
 
approach?
 
Should
 
TTB
 
limit
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
only
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
the
 
information
 
is
 
communicated.
 
1.4.  Should  other  ingredients  that  are  required  to  be  disclosed  under  current  
TTB
 
regulations
 
(FD&C
 
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
one
 
statement
 
on
 
the
 
label?
 
If
 
so,
 
should
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
a
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
that
 
includes
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
(For
 
example,
 
""Contains
 
egg
 
and
 
sulfites"").
 
Or
 
should
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
be
 
identified
 
as
 
such,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
listed
 
separately
 
(for
 
example,
 
""Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg.
 
Contains
 
sulfites"")?
 
Should
 
another
 
statement
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
ingredients
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
under
 
current
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
2  (FD&C  Yellow  No.  5,  cochineal  extract  or  carmine,  sulfites,  and  aspartame)  
to
 
differentiate
 
from
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
 
 
All
 
required
 
disclosure
 
of
 
ingredients
 
should
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
for
 
simplicity.
 
1.5.  Would  requiring  all  mandatory  disclosures  to  be  in  one  place  on  the  label,  
including
 
the
 
proposed
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement,
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
information?
 
Would
 
such
 
a
 
requirement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry
 
members
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
allowing
 
the
 
mandatory
 
disclosures
 
to
 
appear
 
separately?
 
 
 
All
 
required
 
disclosure
 
of
 
ingredients
 
should
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
for
 
simplicity.
 
1.6.  Should  TTB  mandate  specific  placement,  type  size,  and  presentation  
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
statements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
requirements
 
already
 
applicable
 
to
 
all
 
mandatory
 
information
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels?
 
For
 
example,
 
should
 
the
 
required
 
allergen
 
disclosure
 
statement
 
be
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
Or,
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
practicable,
 
should
 
TTB
 
mandate
 
formatting
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA
 
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling?
 
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
keep
 
the
 
requirements
 
consistent
 
with
 
those
 
already
 
existing
 
for
 
other
 
mandatory
 
information.
 
Minimum
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
requirements
 
have
 
been
 
sufficient
 
to
 
communicate
 
alcohol
 
content-
 
we
 
see
 
no
 
reason
 
they
 
wouldn’t
 
be
 
sufficient
 
in
 
this
 
case.
 
A
 
box
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
required.
  2.  Definition  of  Major  Food  Allergen  
 2.1.  N/A  
 3.  Labeling  of  Fish  Species  
 3.1.  TTB  solicits  comments  on  whether  labeling  alcohol  beverages  produced  
using
 
finfish
 
protein
 
merely
 
as
 
containing
 
""fish,""
 
rather
 
than
 
with
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
fish
 
species,
 
provides
 
adequate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
there
 
are
 
alternative
 
approaches
 
to
 
this
 
issue
 
that
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
regarding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
finfish
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages.
 
 
 
“Fish”
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient.
 
 4.  Processing  and  Fining  Agents  
 
3  4.1.  TTB  is  proposing  to  require  the  disclosure  of  fining  or  processing  agents  
that
 
are
 
or
 
contain
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
with
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
including
 
the
 
added
 
parenthetical
 
""(processing
 
aid)""
 
and
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
this
 
proposal.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
egg
 
whites
 
are
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
processing
 
aid
 
for
 
wine,
 
the
 
industry
 
member
 
has
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
disclosing
 
this
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
follows:
 
""Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg
 
(processing
 
aid).""
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
option
 
that
 
industry
 
members
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
use,
 
but
 
they
 
also
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
list
 
these
 
agents
 
without
 
the
 
parenthetical.
 
TTB
 
is
 
not
 
proposing
 
parenthetical
 
statements
 
for
 
other
 
incidental
 
additives
 
besides
 
processing
 
aids.
 
 
 TTB  seeks  comments  on  whether  this  proposal,  which  is  generally  
consistent
 
with
 
FALCPA,
 
will
 
provide
 
adequate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
 
 
This
 
seems
 
sufficient.
 
 5.  Threshold  Levels  
 5.1.  N/A  
 6.  Allergen  Advisory  Labeling  
 6.1.  TTB’s  proposal  does  not  specifically  address  allergen  advisory  labeling,  
such
 
as
 
statements
 
that
 
a
 
product
 
may
 
contain
 
a
 
major
 
food
 
allergen,
 
e.g.,
 
""May
 
Contain
 
(major
 
food
 
allergen).""
 
TTB
 
is
 
concerned
 
that
 
allergen
 
advisory
 
labeling
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
adherence
 
to
 
current
 
good
 
manufacturing
 
practices
 
and
 
could
 
be
 
misleading.
 
TTB
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
allergen
 
advisory
 
labeling.
 
 
 
We
 
believe
 
TTB’s
 
requirements
 
should
 
be
 
aligned
 
with
 
those
 
for
 
food,
 
and
 
if
 
these
 
statements
 
on
 
food
 
do
 
not
 
undermine
 
GMP,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient
 
for
 
beverages.
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
aligning
 
with
 
food
 
labeling
 
practices,
 
TTB
 
should
 
allow
 
for
 
consumers
 
and
 
producers
 
some
 
leeway
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
best
 
decisions
 
for
 
themselves
 
here.
 
A
 
producer
 
may
 
wish
 
to
 
disclose,
 
out
 
of
 
an
 
overabundance
 
of
 
caution,
 
that
 
equipment
 
is
 
shared
 
between
 
products
 
that
 
do
 
and
 
products
 
that
 
do
 
not
 
contain
 
an
 
often
 
severe
 
allergen,
 
such
 
as
 
peanuts.
 
A
 
consumer
 
with
 
a
 
particularly
 
severe
 
allergy
 
may
 
wish
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
equipment
 
used
 
to
 
process
 
a
 
given
 
product
 
was
 
also
 
used
 
to
 
produce
 
a
 
product
 
containing
 
their
 
allergen.
 
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
pursuing
 
this
 
allergen
 
statement
 
requirement
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
mission
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
important
 
information.
 
Why,
 
within
 
that
 
rule,
 
should
 
it
 
disallow
 
this
 
potentially
 
important
 
disclosure
 
of
 
allergen
 
information?
 
4   
ACSA
 
conducted
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
its
 
members,
 
and
 
found
 
that
 
some
 
consumers
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
more
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
allergens
 
generally
 
considered
 
the
 
most
 
dangerous.
 
 29%  of  respondents  reported  that  consumers  had  asked  them  for  info  about  
allergen
 
content.
 
Of
 
these,
 
83%
 
reported
 
that
 
consumer
 
inquiries
 
focused
 
on
 
gluten
 
content,
 
while
 
11%
 
had
 
been
 
asked
 
about
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
“Big
 
9”
 
allergens
 
(milk,
 
eggs,
 
fish,
 
shellfish,
 
tree
 
nuts,
 
peanuts,
 
wheat,
 
soybeans,
 
and
 
sesame).
  Despite  most  inquiries  focusing  on  gluten,  whose  labeling  in  most  distilled  spirits  
produced
 
under
 
standard
 
practices
 
would
 
be
 
exempt
 
under
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
rules
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
inquiries
 
about
 
the
 
Big
 
9
 
does
 
indicate
 
that
 
some
 
consumers
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
have
 
severe
 
allergies
 
to
 
major
 
allergens,
 
and
 
willing
 
distilleries
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
choose
 
to
 
indicate
 
their
 
presence
 
within
 
the
 
facility
 
if
 
they
 
choose
 
to
 
do
 
so.
  B.  Exceptions  1.  Exceptions  Found  in  Current  Regulations  
 1.1.  N/A  
 2.  Distillation  
 2.1.  TTB  is  proposing  to  amend  the  distilled  spirits  regulations  in  proposed  27  
CFR
 
5.75(b)(2)
 
to
 
specifically
 
provide
 
that
 
the
 
mandatory
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
do
 
not
 
apply
 
to
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
a
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
product
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
completely
 
distilled
 
in
 
such
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
no
 
protein
 
remains
 
in
 
the
 
distilled
 
spirits.
 
As
 
needed,
 
TTB
 
will
 
evaluate
 
compliance
 
by
 
verifying
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
distilled
 
component
 
using
 
scientifically
 
valid
 
analytical
 
methods
 
that
 
can
 
reliably
 
detect
 
the
 
presence
 
or
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
or
 
protein
 
fragments
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
If
 
ingredients
 
containing
 
protein
 
are
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
product
 
after
 
distillation,
 
and
 
no
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
are
 
listed
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
industry
 
members
 
must
 
be
 
prepared
 
to
 
substantiate,
 
upon
 
request,
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
distillate,
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
any
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
added
 
ingredients,
 
and
 
the
 
precautions
 
taken
 
to
 
prevent
 
cross-contact.
 
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
this
 
method
 
of
 
verifying
 
compliance
 
is
 
adequate
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
and
 
whether
 
there
 
are
 
better
 
alternatives.
 
  
ACSA
 
supports
 
TTB’s
 
proposal
 
to
 
not
 
require
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
in
 
spirits
 
that
 
use
 
those
 
allergen
 
proteins
 
only
 
pre-distillation.
 
 
5   
Yes,
 
testing
 
compliance
 
through
 
lab
 
analysis
 
on
 
an
 
as-needed
 
basis
 
is
 
sufficient.
 
 3.  Compliance  Date  
 3.1.  TTB  is  proposing  a  compliance  date  of  5  years  from  the  date  that  a  final  
rule
 
resulting
 
from
 
this
 
proposal
 
is
 
published
 
in
 
the
 
Federal
 
Register
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
new
 
labeling
 
information.
 
TTB
 
solicits
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
the
 
proposed
 
compliance
 
date
 
would
 
suffice
 
to
 
limit
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
small
 
businesses
 
and
 
to
 
reduce
 
overall
 
costs
 
of
 
compliance
 
while
 
ensuring
 
that
 
consumers
 
are
 
adequately
 
informed.
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
compliance
 
date
 
for
 
any
 
new
 
regulations
 
on
 
allergen,
 
ingredient,
 
or
 
""Alcohol
 
Facts""
 
labeling
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
coherent
 
and
 
timely
 
manner
 
while
 
also
 
reducing
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry.
 
 
 
If
 
the
 
additional
 
allergen
 
information
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
other
 
mandated
 
disclosures,
 
a
 
5
 
year
 
compliance
 
date
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient,
 
even
 
for
 
affected
 
small
 
businesses.
 
If
 
the
 
allergy
 
disclosure
 
is
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box,
 
or
 
requiring
 
significantly
 
larger
 
physical
 
space
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
burdensome.
 
Thank  you  for  consideration  of  ACSA’s  comments.   We  appreciate  the  ability  to  respond  and  are  
happy
 
to
 
answer
 
any
 
questions
 
you
 
may
 
have
 
upon
 
review.

Re: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Notice No. 
238; Docket No. TTB–2025–0003) (90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (January 17, 2025)) 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
On behalf of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), a national trade 
association representing the nation’s leading distillers of all sizes and marketers of distilled 
spirits sold in the United States, we appreciate the opportunity to comment upon the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) major food allergen labeling notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) and look forward to a thoughtful evaluation by TTB as you consider 
regulations on this important labeling proposal. 
 
As regulated producers, importers, and marketers of distilled spirits, we share the goal of TTB 
and the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act of providing consumers with meaningful 
information about the beverages they choose to purchase, especially when it pertains to 
allergenic material that could be present in the ﬁnal product. Consumers deserve labeling 
statements that provide information that an individual with allergies can rely upon when 
making food choices. Scientiﬁcally-based major food allergen labeling—like the voluntary 
program that properly identiﬁes products containing allergenic protein capable of causing an 
adverse reaction—can provide beneﬁcial information to consumers with food allergies.  
 
DISCUS members wholly support allergen labeling for distilled spirits products and are currently 
utilizing the aforementioned voluntary allergen labeling scheme to inform consumers about 
certain products in their portfolios that might contain major food allergens. For the reasons 
detailed below, our comment for the current NPRM focuses on the following points of 
consideration: 
 
A. The Major Food Allergen Statement Should Maintain the Current Phrasing and Structure 
B. Inclusion of Major Food Allergens Within an Ingredient Statement Should be Permitted 
C. Allergen Statements Should Not Be Required to Be Combined with Other Disclosures 
D. Flexibility in Statement Placement Would Be Preferred  
E. Processing and Fining Agent Disclosure Should Depend on Presence in the Final Product

F. Labeling of Fish Species Should be Optional 
G. Allergen Advisory Labeling Should Not Be Included in This Proposal 
 
Additionally, we provide comments related to: Exceptions from Allergen Labeling 
Requirements;  Eﬀective Date and Compliance with the Proposed Regulations; and Other 
Questions. 
 
Points of Consideration  
 
As recognized by TTB in this NPRM, distilled spirits products are not like other foods for 
purposes of allergen labeling, as the distillation process can completely transform the 
components used to create a distilled spirits product. As stated in TTB Ruling 2020-2 and based 
on prior FDA determinations, distillation “removes protein if good manufacturing practices are 
followed, and because it is possible to verify the absence of protein or protein fragments (and 
thus gluten) in these products using scientiﬁcally valid analytical methods.”1   
 
Given this reality, the vast majority of distilled spirits products do not contain any allergenic 
material. We applaud TTB for focusing the distilled spirits regulations in this proposal around 
ingredients present in or added to ﬁnished product, not the constituents that went through or 
were used as processing aids in the distillation process, as long as the major food allergen used 
in the process “have been completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the 
ﬁnal product.”  
 
Labeling initiatives, like allergen labeling statements, should be clear, concise, and 
understandable for the end consumer, as well as structured in a way that is actionable for 
producers to implement. Any element that could be misleading or confusing will only serve to 
unnecessarily limit consumer choice and detract from the eﬃcacy of the labeling statement.  
 
It is from our shared objective that we respectfully submit our views regarding the instant 
notice and oﬀer measured feedback for the Bureau’s consideration to make this proposal as 
eﬀective and workable for industry and consumers as possible. Below we outline our feedback 
and provide additional context that we hope the Bureau will consider as it progresses with this 
rulemaking.  
 
1. Labeling of Major Food Allergens and other Mandatory Disclosures  
 
A. The Major Food Allergen Statement Should Maintain the Current Phrasing and Structure 
 
In this NPRM, TTB proposes to alter the existing major food allergen statement language to 
require producers to include the phrase “Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon 
 
1 TTB Ruling 2020-2 - Gluten Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, 
October 13, 2020, https://www.ttb.gov/rulings/r2020-2.  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 3 
 
   
 
and the name of the food source for which each major food allergen is derived. While we agree 
with the adoption of an on-pack allergen statement for major food allergens, DISCUS urges the 
Bureau to maintain the existing declaration language (""Contains: [____]"") outlined in the 
voluntary regulations. We see no reason to revise the allergen labeling statement language after 
almost 20 years of industry implementation of the voluntary framework, especially when this 
language is universally recognized by consumers and consistent with the allergen disclosures 
required by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).  
 
Consumers will most beneﬁt from an approach that is consistent with the deﬁnition and 
disclosure of ""major food allergen"" that already exists under FALCPA, the Food Allergy Safety, 
Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
TTB’s proposed phrasing does not align with the FDA's allergen labeling requirements and may 
cause consumer confusion on how to read this statement in conjunction with a separate 
""contains"" statement for ingredients, such as sulﬁtes and colors, that is present on some 
distilled spirits labels. 
 
Disclosures should communicate necessary information to consumers in the least disruptive 
manner possible. The use of ""Contains:"" followed by the required ingredients and allergens in a 
singular statement clearly communicates the information without encroachment on limited 
label space with unnecessary words. The real estate on distilled spirits labels is extremely 
limited, given the other mandatory information and that some containers are as small as 50 ml. 
In particular for small bottles, adding ""Contains major food allergen(s):"" may be diﬃcult to 
accommodate in the appropriate legibility and type size, and those superﬂuous words will most 
certainly detract from the core information – the actual allergens. 
 
As stated above, most distilled spirits brand owners of products containing a major allergen are 
already labeling these allergens under TTB’s voluntary disclosure regulations. Altering the 
phrasing of the allergen declaration statement would negatively impact those suppliers 
currently labeling these allergens on their products, as the adoption of this proposal as drafted 
would require these suppliers to undergo costly relabeling revisions to bring their labels into 
compliance. If TTB maintains the current language, no label changes would be needed for those 
products, which would save suppliers thousands of dollars per brand and free up logistics and 
supply chain focus for other products.  
 
For these reasons, TTB should retain the current statement language outlined in the voluntary 
allergen labeling regulations.  
 
B. Inclusion of Major Food Allergens Within an Ingredient Statement Should be Permitted 
 
In its NPRM, TTB asks whether the inclusion of major food allergens within an ingredient 
statement (either voluntary or in a future mandatory declaration) on labels as an alternative to 
a separate major food allergen statement should be allowed. For those suppliers who choose to 
include voluntary ingredient statements on their labels, we would support the option to list Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 4 
 
   
 
major food allergens within the ingredient statement. Due to limited label space, including a 
major food allergen within a voluntary ingredient statement would be easier to implement than 
trying to create enough space to meet another set of legibility and type size requirements. It 
would also beneﬁt consumers by placing all ingredient information in one accessible location.  
 
While DISCUS does not support a mandatory ingredient labeling statement on distilled spirits 
products for a host of reasons outlined in our comment in the ANPRM last year, if such a 
statement was mandated in the future, we would support inclusion of major food allergen 
information in the ingredient statement. A company should have the ﬂexibility to decide on a 
case-by-case basis if the allergen statement would appear within the list of ingredients or as 
part of a ""Contains"" statement. This would also align with FDA requirements.  
 
C. Allergen Statements Should Not Be Required to Be Combined with Other Disclosures 
 
TTB also queried whether they should limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens, as opposed to its current allowance to also identify the presence of ingredients 
such as caramel color, cochineal extract, or sulﬁtes, for example, and whether all mandatory 
disclosures should be included together.  
 
DISCUS would not oppose limiting the term ""Contains"" to solely food allergens when both 
allergens and other mandatory information are listed on the same label to assist in clarifying 
that the ""Contains"" moniker pertains strictly to food allergen listing. The labeling of spirits 
products, both in the U.S. and around the world, is becoming increasingly complicated and 
consumers could be confused as to what the contents of a label are actually communicating (i.e. 
food allergens, mandatory disclosure of ingredients, optional disclaimers, etc.). We would prefer 
to keep these other ingredient disclosures separate from allergen disclosures to avoid consumer 
confusion, as most producers currently do when designing their labels. In lieu of using 
“Contains” for the other TTB-mandated disclosures when sharing a label with allergen 
declarations, the Bureau could consider permitting similar terms such as “Includes.” 
 
If TTB did permit combining the major food allergens and other required ingredient listings into 
one ""Contains"" statement, we would request further clariﬁcation regarding how the list of 
components within the statement would be determined. Would the list of callouts be organized 
by weight, by order of addition, etc.? We would recommend that any major allergens be listed 
ﬁrst and then have the ﬂexibility to list the other ingredients as desired subsequently (e.g.,  
""Contains: Fish, Sesame, FD&C Yellow #5, and Caramel Color.”) This would highlight the most 
critical ingredients ﬁrst and reduce the risk of consumer confusion or inability to locate this 
important information.  
 
D. Flexibility in Statement Placement Would Be Preferred  
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks whether all mandatory disclosures, including allergen statements, should 
be located in one place on the label and whether the statement should be set apart by a box Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 5 
 
   
 
outlining the information. DISCUS does not support mandating a speciﬁc location for either all 
required TTB mandatory disclosures or the allergen statement itself. These requirements would 
take up additional space that may already be limited on labels and require the redesign of 
allergen labeling statements already in the marketplace.  
 
Consumers do not currently have any expectations on where to ﬁnd allergen information on 
alcohol beverage labels, as producers can either place these statements on the front or back 
label, and existing TTB requirements ensure these statements are conspicuous and accessible. 
Any requirements for a speciﬁc allergen statement location will be burdensome to industry 
members to eﬀectuate. Given the diﬀerences in label die-line size, SKU volumes, and the 
number of brands within an industry member's portfolio, individual company’s should be 
permitted ﬂexibility to determine where best to include the allergen statement on their labels. 
To do otherwise would upset longstanding precedent and require costly label redesign and 
printing operations across the industry.  
 
Additionally, DISCUS would not support mandating that the allergen statement be enclosed 
within a box on the label. Placing a box around the allergen statement would not conform with 
FDA's current policy and, if TTB is trying to harmonize with FDA's allergen statement 
requirements to the extent possible, then no box should be required. Regarding prescribed type 
size, under the FDA framework, the word 'Contains' (without a colon) is printed with a type size 
no smaller than the type size used in a list of ingredients. We would suggest that the TTB 
allergen statement should align with the current regulatory type size requirements for TTB’s 
mandatory information, which is 1 millimeter for containers 200 ml or less and 2 millimeters for 
containers larger than 200 ml. This would ensure consistency with the rest of the required 
information on a beverage alcohol label.   
 
E. Processing and Fining Agent Disclosure Should Depend on Presence in the Final Product 
 
In the NPRM, TTB proposes to require the disclosure of ﬁning or processing agents that are or 
contain major food allergens, with the option of including the added parenthetical “(processing 
aid)” to denote that the allergen originates from a processing aid, rather than a central 
ingredient in the product.  
 
Most processing aids used in the production of distilled spirits products are added during the 
fermentation process and subsequently distilled out of the product, ensuring that no trace of 
that processing aid, or potential allergen, remains in the ﬁnal product. Under TTB’s proposal, 
this would mean that these processing aids would not need to be disclosed as part of an 
allergen statement on a distilled spirits product.  
 
Requiring disclosure of allergens that are actually present in the ﬁnal product versus those that 
are merely used as a processing aid (consistent with FALCPA) provides consumers with needed 
transparency that will assist them in making appropriate purchasing decisions. TTB should focus 
their regulatory eﬀorts on allergen presence in the ﬁnal product rather than use in the Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 6 
 
   
 
production process to permit for consistency in approach and the greatest protection for 
consumers. Companies should have the ﬂexibility to determine if they would like to disclose or 
refrain from listing processing aids as an allergen depending upon the de minimis amount used 
in production of a product. It would be counterproductive to have an allergen labeling initiative 
that over warns when allergens may not be present in the ﬁnal product, as these declarations 
could become meaningless to individuals with food allergies and impact their potential 
beverage choices as a result. 
 
While DISCUS supports the inclusion of processing and ﬁning agents that are or contain major 
food allergens as part of the major food allergen disclosure if present in the ﬁnal product, we 
agree that the parenthetical identiﬁer should be an optional disclosure and not required. 
Consumers will likely not understand what processing aids are and this parenthetical could 
cause confusion around the product and its constituents. Further education would be required 
by the beverage alcohol industry for the consumer to understand why this is being disclosed on 
a label.  
 
In the interest of providing accurate product information, another option could be the use of a 
""Processed with"" statement instead of ""Contains,"" which would allow for a more accurate 
description of a product treated with ﬁning agents or processing aids during production. 
""Processed with"" acknowledges that the ﬁning agent or processing aid has been used during the 
production process, but does not necessarily imply that there are quantiﬁable residues in the 
ﬁnal product.  
 
F. Labeling of Fish Species Should be Optional 
 
While pertaining to wine and beer products, TTB is not proposing to require the listing of the 
speciﬁc ﬁsh species when including ﬁsh in an allergen statement. Many DISCUS members have 
wine and beer products in their portfolios, so we would like to provide a few brief comments on 
this issue. DISCUS appreciates the Bureau’s stance to not require the listing of the speciﬁc 
species of ﬁsh given the unique nature of beverage alcohol products, despite FALCPA 
amendments requiring the labeling of the species of ﬁsh used as an ingredient in a food 
product.  
 
We believe mandating the species of ﬁsh to be listed would place an unnecessary burden on 
alcohol producers to obtain additional paperwork from the isinglass or ﬁsh gelatin supplier on 
the ﬁsh species, which may or may not be available. The ﬁsh species is also irrelevant for 
purposes of an allergen statement for the use of these processing aids. We, however, support 
the option to include the ﬁsh species if a company determines they would like to further state 
the species of ﬁsh in parenthesis after the ﬁsh allergen statement.  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025

G. Allergen Advisory Labeling Should Not Be Included in This Proposal 
 
DISCUS does not recommend the Bureau build an allergen advisory labeling component (""may 
contain"" statements) into the proposal at this time. In our opinion, the beverage alcohol 
industry is not familiarized enough with these sorts of disclosures and likely does not have the 
proper knowledge to accurately disclose allergies in this way on an industry-wide scale. It would 
be diﬃcult to determine the allergens to list due to the operational inconsistencies on the part 
of manufacturers and distilled spirits operations generally do not have many of the same 
allergenic risks as other food manufacturing facilities.  
 
Further, allergen advisory labeling has the potential to create more confusion for consumers, as 
“may contain"" statements do not provide clear and actionable messages for consumers 
regarding the presence of a major food allergen.   
 
Nothing prevents suppliers from adding “may contain” statements on their beverage alcohol 
products currently, and it appears some suppliers are choosing to utilize them for certain 
products. For consumer safety and clarity, we are not opposed to their optional inclusion on 
certain products to ensure any potential exposure is noted. The inclusion of this statement 
should be at the discretion of companies as an optional statement and not a mandatory feature 
of a broader allergen labeling scheme.  
 
2. Exceptions from Allergen Labeling Requirements  
 
DISCUS applauds the Bureau for once again recognizing that distillation fundamentally alters 
and transforms ingredients, stripping away any allergenic material, and including language in 
proposed § 5.75(b)(2) that enshrines this principle into the regulatory structure. TTB, in this 
section, places appropriate focus on ingredients added to the distilled spirits product after 
distillation and evaluating label claims (or the absence thereof) related to the presence of these 
ingredients in the ﬁnal product.    
 
This regulation will go a long way to reduce consumer confusion around distilled spirits allergen 
labeling statements. Without the recognition of the transformation caused by the distillation 
process, including “wheat” on a spirits label as an ingredient, for example, could suggest that a 
whiskey distilled from wheat contains wheat in the ﬁnal product, when this is not the case as 
the wheat proteins are stripped from the product through the distillation process and all that 
remains is alcohol. This wheat declaration could unnecessarily alarm those with wheat allergies 
and inadvertently suggest that it had the nutritional value of wheat. Wheat whiskey is not the 
same as a slice of whole wheat bread, and it would not be appropriate to confuse consumers 
with any suggestion to the contrary.  
 
While we support the Bureau’s proposed exception language, further clariﬁcation would be 
appreciated around the veriﬁcation process. How is the Bureau planning to verify the presence 
or absence of allergens? Will allergens need to be listed as part of the formula submission? How Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 8 
 
   
 
will TTB be reviewing allergens during the COLA process? Will TTB mandate ﬂavor houses to 
provide an additional section on the ﬂavor ingredient data (FID) sheet to determine if allergens 
are present in a ﬂavor, or would additional documentation be required at the time of a formula 
submission? Will TTB accept allergen self-certiﬁcation? Who will assume the liability if an 
allergen is missed since TTB would be verifying the statement? 
 
These questions, among others, will need to be thoughtfully considered as TTB seeks to ﬁnalize 
this proposal.  
 
3. Eﬀective Date and Compliance with the Proposed Regulations  
 
A multitude of brands and labels will be aﬀected by this initiative, both domestically and 
internationally. Given the global commerce in beverage alcohol products and the multitude of 
products that are imported into the United States, DISCUS appreciates the ﬁve-year phase-in 
period included in the proposal and believes that this implementation timeframe should be 
suﬃcient to eﬀectuate the necessary labeling changes. Compliance would be possible even 
sooner, of course, if the Bureau decides to maintain the existing allergen statement language. 
This revision would bring most allergen-containing products in the marketplace into almost 
immediate compliance, as most products containing allergens include the voluntary label 
statement.  
 
DISCUS appreciates the Bureau not requiring resubmission of COLAs to include allergen 
statements if not already present, as this would’ve greatly increased burdens throughout the 
industry and for the Bureau’s ALFD staﬀ.  
 
Further clariﬁcation is needed, however, regarding the exact mechanics of the ultimate 
compliance date and which products it could impact that are already in the marketplace. Would 
it only be applicable to new product produced after the ﬁnal rule goes into eﬀect? What about 
inventory sitting either in a warehouse or on a store shelf? Should industry members expect to 
receive a blanket ""use up"" for all pre-compliance date bottles? Would existing inventory need to 
be reworked to comply with the ﬁnal rule? What if there is overlap of old and new allergen 
labeling bottles and what liability/exposure would industry members face? These important 
questions demonstrate the realities suppliers will need to contend with if this proposal is 
ﬁnalized, as well as the type of questions the Bureau should be prepared to respond to either in 
the rule language itself or an accompanying FAQ guidance document.  
 
We also urge the Bureau to synchronize the implementation of any mandatory labeling changes 
so that industry members are able to comply with these new requirements in the most eﬃcient 
manner. This would include not only the proposed alcohol facts labeling requirements, but also 
any ingredient labeling proposal the Bureau might be considering. While we understand that 
the advance notice of proposed rulemaking related to ingredient labeling was withdrawn earlier  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 9 
 
   
 
this year prior to its release, if the Bureau was intending to revive it in another form, it’s critical 
to note that any eventual ingredient labeling requirements being on a diﬀerent implementation 
track would be ﬁnancially and logistically devasting for industry members large and small.  
 
It would be unreasonable to ask industry members to undergo costly label redesign to include 
allergen and nutrient content information and begin production on those new labels across all 
their product lines, only to be notiﬁed they will need to restart label redesign to incorporate 
ingredient information in a couple years. We respectfully request that TTB consider this 
important point as they seek to ﬁnalize these pending rulemakings and prepare their future 
regulatory agenda. 
 
4. Other Questions 
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks whether a QR code could alternatively be used to provide major food 
allergen disclosures. While we support including major food allergen disclosures physically on 
labels, we recognize that QR codes would be an adequate alternative to achieve compliance 
under the proposed rulemaking, particularly if the Bureau is concerned about potential costs for 
industry members or suppliers want to add this information to a QR code while they plan 
labeling changes.  
 
The ability to use QR code to provide allergen and alcohol facts statements would allow a 
company to better manage label ordering, label inventory and write oﬀ costs, as changes can 
quickly be made to a website if there is a change to batching that may or may not aﬀect allergen 
and/or alcohol facts statements.  QR codes could also be a helpful way to alleviate the already 
cluttered mandatory information required on label (i.e. TTB mandatory information, CSR 
statements, state mandated recycling information, etc.), as they are a consumer-friendly way to 
access important information without taking up additional space on labels and placing potential 
ﬁnancial burdens on suppliers.  
 
TTB also queried about compliance costs associated with the proposal and noted that additional 
analytical testing was not required. Some industry members will still seek to utilize outside 
laboratories, however, to test for the presence or absence of a major food allergen, so potential 
operating costs for swab kits and lab analysis should be considered.  
 
Conclusion 
 
America’s distillers and marketers of spirits want to ensure that consumers have access to the 
major food allergen information they need. We appreciate the opportunity to comment upon 
the Bureau's allergen labeling initiative and stand ready to work with TTB to support a allergen 
labeling scheme that is scientiﬁcally-based and properly recognizes the transformative nature of 
distillation on ingredients used in the production process.

Re: TTB Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg, 
 
I write on behalf of the Brewers Association (BA) to provide written input on TTB 
Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages.1  We appreciate the extension of the comment period for this notice and 
respectfully submit these written comments on behalf of America’s small and 
independent brewers.  We thank you in advance for your time and attention to these 
comments. 
 
As you know, the Brewers Association is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association 
of brewers, for brewers and by brewers.  We have approximately 5,000 U.S. 
professional brewery members and over 1,200 supplier members from throughout 
the beer supply chain.  Our mission is to promote and protect American 
craft brewers and their beers. 
 
The Brewers Association has long supported the concept of mandatory allergen 
labeling for malt beverages, along with other alcohol beverages.  A consumer’s 
ignorance about the presence of an allergen in a beverage can have serious, even 
life-threatening, health consequences.  This distinguishes, in a fundamental way, 
allergen labeling from disclosures related to, for example, calories, carbohydrates, 
fat, or protein. 
 
We now turn to our specific comments on Notice 238’s proposed regulations. 
 
 
 
 
1 90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (Jan. 17, 2025). 2 
 
1. Materials Not Present in the Finished Product Should Not Require Label 
Disclosure 
 
While the mandatory allergen labeling rules proposed by Notice 238 contemplate 
an exemption process, the Brewers Association believes that a rational rule must 
start with the premise that disclosures are required only if the finished product – the 
product reaching consumers – contains the allergen in question.  After all, a malt 
beverage or other food that does not contain an allergen will not cause an allergic 
reaction among sensitive individuals. 
 
In this regard, we wish to remind TTB that over-disclosure has costs for consumers.  
Individuals with allergies should have access to as wide a variety of food, including 
malt beverages, as safety permits.  This consideration may explain the Food & Drug 
Administration’s (FDA’s) failure to mandate “may contains” allergen warnings (they 
are voluntary), as a mandate might encourage risk-averse food manufacturers to 
overuse such labeling as a simple way to avoid liability and careful testing.  Warning 
a consumer away from foods that they can consume without an adverse health 
reaction deprives that consumer of choice and variety without a corresponding 
health benefit. 
 
Notice 238 proposes including processing aids and other incidental additives in an 
allergen labeling rule, citing the approach of The Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).2  As TTB recognizes, however, while 
harmonizing with FDA standards under FALCPA is often beneficial, Congress clearly 
contemplated that TTB would depart from those standards where appropriate.3   
 
TTB already has recognized that alcohol beverages will, at times, require a different 
approach.  Most notably, Notice 238 proposes to codify existing TTB policy treating 
distilled spirits as not containing an allergen if the product has been subject to 
complete distillation that removes allergenic proteins.4 
 
We urge TTB to take a similar approach in other instances when sound scientific 
evidence indicates the lack of allergenic proteins in a finished product.  To take one 
example, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have ruled that the fining 
agent isinglass can safely be used as a processing aid in beer and wine.5  While TTB, 
with FDA assistance, should undertake a review of the evidence and not rely blindly 
on other nations’ conclusions, we commend to TTB the more flexible approach that 
does not result in over-warning sensitive individuals to allergens that are not, in 
fact, found in a finished product.

Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to a notiﬁcation from Brewers of 
Europe and BFBi on isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 11 
of Directive 2000/13/EC – for permanent exemption from labelling (July 6, 2007); Food Standards 
Australia New Zealand, FINAL ASSESSMENT REPORT - APPLICATION A490 -EXEMPTION OF 
ALLERGEN DECLARATION FOR ISINGLASS (March 20, 2009). 3 
 
 
Notice 238 proposes to exempt the need to identify a particular fish species where a 
Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act)-regulated product may contain fish.6  
As already noted, we question whether the most likely reason for such a disclosure 
– use of the fining agent isinglass – should trigger an allergen disclosure.  In any 
case, if a disclosure of fish is required, the Brewers Association agrees that the 
identification of fish species should not be required in the case of fish-derived 
processing aids. 
 
Notice 238 proposes to permit the label of a food made with a processing aid 
derived from one of the major allergens to optionally identify a material as a 
“processing aid” on the label.7  As already noted, the Brewers Association does not 
agree that a processing aid whose material does not remain in a finished food 
should require disclosure.  But if TTB mandates such disclosure, we would support 
providing the option of identifying the allergen as a “processing aid.” 
 
2. For an Exemption System to Work, TTB Must Establish Sensible 
Thresholds 
 
The Brewers Association supports the development of tolerance thresholds, as any 
exemption system becomes otherwise unstable and untenable as detection 
technology improves. 
 
Notice 238 indicates that TTB, deferring to FDA, will not adopt any tolerances for 
allergens in FAA Act-regulated products.8  But without a threshold on what trace 
amounts of a material are permitted, advances in detection technology will require 
constant updates to recognized exemptions.  Of course, such thresholds should be 
based on sound science.  But as detection technology improves, even trace 
amounts of a material, perhaps naturally occurring and from multiple sources, 
might become detectable. 
 
TTB regulations should create certainty, not require the industry to “chase 
technology.”  In the case of the exemption process contemplated by TTB, better 
detection technology would require it to amend the regulations as soon as 
advancing detection technology can identify minute levels of an exempted material 
in a finished product.  This burden of technology “moving the goalposts” would put 
a strain on both government and industry resources.

3. “Contains” Should be SuƯicient (instead of “Contains Major Food 
Allergens”) 
 
The Brewers Association believes that the statement preceding a mandatory 
allergen disclosure should simply say “contains,” and not the wordy and 
unnecessary “contains major food allergens” as proposed in Notice 238.9 
 
To any reasonable consumer with a known allergen sensitivity, the word “contains” 
plus an identification of the allergen(s) present will give that individual the 
information they need.  A person sensitive to gluten, for example, would instantly 
recognize that a product labeled “Contains: Wheat” could trigger an allergic 
reaction.  Adding “major food allergens” does not add any useful information.  If the 
individual does not yet know they suffer from an allergic reaction to a particular 
material, then identifying that material as a “major food allergen” does nothing to 
alert that individual to a possible health reaction. 
 
Given that TTB proposes to defer to FDA on quite a few policy matters tackled by 
Notice 238, the Brewers Association does not understand why it ignores FDA when 
it comes to the wording of the proposed mandatory allergen statement.  Under the 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) administered by FDA, the word 
“contains” is sufficient for the labels of foods falling under FDA’s primary labeling 
jurisdiction.10  The Brewers Association does not perceive any need for a different 
approach with respect to FAA Act-regulated products. 
 
The Brewers Association also urges TTB to consider regulatory burden when 
choosing the wording of its disclosure.  “Contains major food allergens” is 
unnecessarily wordy, taking valuable labeling space – a scarce resource on a 
typical malt beverage label.11  Keeping mandatory wording short where, as here, the 
benefit to the consumer of added words is unclear strikes a better balance between 
consumer protection and avoiding unnecessary burdens on the industry. 
 
Finally, using the term “major allergens” erroneously assumes that the typical 
consumer understands what this means.  It strains credulity to believe that 
consumers know the legal distinction between “major” allergens (those in FALCP 
and the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research [FASTER] Act) and 
other allergens.  Once again, the only conclusion is that the added information 
would do little to assist consumers make smart choices.

10 See 21 U.S.C. § 343(w).  
11 A standard twelve-ounce beer can with a full-wrap label has just 3.625” times 8” of total labeling 
space available. 5 
 
4. A New Major Allergen Disclosure Should Incorporate Existing Disclosures 
for FD&C Yellow No. 5, Cochineal Extract or Carmine, Sulﬁtes, and 
Aspartame 
 
The Brewers Association encourages TTB to adopt a final rule that groups all 
allergen information in a single place.  Existing TTB regulations require the label 
disclosure of FD&C Yellow No. 5, Cochineal Extract or Carmine, Sulfites, and 
Aspartame,12 all due to the possibility of allergic reactions to these materials.  
Folding the disclosure of such material into the disclosure of major food allergens 
makes eminent sense. 
 
An effective allergen labeling rule will enable consumers to find all mandatory 
allergen information in one place.  Placing such disclosures in two places – one for 
“major” allergens and a different place for other allergens – would risk a consumer 
seeing one statement and assuming that it conveys all mandatory allergen 
information.  A single grouping after the word “contains” would best ensure that 
consumers find all the allergen information they need. 
 
Moreover, dividing allergen disclosures into multiple separate statements based on 
the legal basis for the disclosure would elevate legal form over real-world 
substance.  As already explained in Section 3, above, we do not believe consumers 
would recognize nor understand the distinction between FALCP-mandated allergen 
disclosures and those (such as sulfites) arising from prior TTB rulemaking action.  
Basing a consumer-protection rule on legal distinctions few consumers understand 
would not advance the informative purpose of allergen labeling. 
 
5. A Linear Display on the Label is SuƯicient and Gives Producers Flexibility  
 
The Brewers Association agrees with Notice 238’s proposed approach of permitting 
an allergen disclosure via linear display.  We see no reason to highlight allergens in 
a text box.13 
 
Individuals with allergies already are familiar with FDA’s allergen disclosures, which 
do not require a specific text box or other highlighting of allergen information.  
Instead, FDA’s major allergen rule allows the “contains” statement as text within 
the Principal Display Panel.14  We are not aware of any problem with consumers 
finding the allergen information on FD&C Act-regulated products. 
 
TTB must also recognize that the amount of space on a beer label is quite limited.  
For industry, this means that any loss of space to a text box deprives them of 
valuable branding room.  More importantly, consumers interested in allergen 
information do not have a large area to scan in order to find an allergen statement.  
 
12 See 27 C.F .R. § 7.63(b). 
13 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 5769. 
14 See FDA Guidance Document, Guidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding Food 
Allergen Labeling (Edition 5), FDA-2022-D-0099 (Jan. 2025). 6 
 
Thus, we perceive little danger that a linear display without a text box or other 
highlighting will result in consumers not finding the allergen information they need. 
 
Finally, permitting allergen information by linear display is consistent with TTB’s 
position in Notice 237, proposing certain nutritional declarations on the labels of 
FAA Act-regulated products.  We see no reason to treat allergen information 
differently. 
 
6. The Compliance Date Should be the Same as Any Compliance Date for 
the Nutritional Labeling Rules in Notice 237 and any Compliance Date for 
FDA’s Front-of-Package Labeling Rule 
 
Small and independent brewers, along with most of the alcohol beverage industry, 
currently face the prospect of three new federal labeling mandates: 
 
 The mandatory allergen disclosures contemplated by Notice 238; 
 
 The nutritional, alcohol content, and possibly other disclosures 
contemplated by TTB Notice 237;15 and 
 
 For alcohol beverages falling under FDA’s primary labeling jurisdiction, a 
front-of-label packaging mandate contemplated by FDA Docket No. FDA–
2024–N–2910.16 
 
The prospect of implementing different labeling changes at different times is 
daunting to any industry member, but particularly to small producers.  The Brewers 
Association accordingly supports Notice 238’s suggestion17 that any 
implementation date be coordinated with the mandatory effective date of any final 
regulations flowing from TTB Notice 237. 
 
The Brewers Association also supports Notice 238’s suggestion18 that a final rule 
allow industry members to add a mandatory allergen labeling statement to labels 
without the need to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) from 
TTB.  This sensible approach will save considerable government and industry 
resources.  Absent this accommodation, TTB would find itself inundated with 
hundreds of thousands of COLA applications as the compliance date for new 
regulations approaches. 
 
Finally, we support a five-year compliance date as the default phase-in period for 
any new allergen labeling mandate.  As explained in more detail in the Brewers 
Association’s comments in connection with Notice 237, however, we do not believe 
the five-year period will spare all or perhaps even most small brewers from the need 
for a regulatory-mandated label change.

AllergyStrong is writing to encourage the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to finalize the proposed rule mandating labeling major food allergens and to propose a rule requiring full labeling of all ingredients on alcoholic beverages. Required food allergen labeling would increase transparency in consumable products, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the safety of a product for their health and safety.

Required food allergen labeling would increase transparency in consumable products, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the safety of a product for their health and safety.   Labeling for allergens on packaging at the point of sale allows the broadest spectrum of consumers the ability to assess the safety of a product for purchase. This placement is important as it coincides with packaged food labeling and is where consumers are accustomed to looking for allergen and nutritional information. However, in the absence of any labeling and if absolutely necessary, AllergyStrong also supports the use of QR codes which will also serve an important role in conveying important allergen and other safety and nutritional information to help protect allergic consumers.  AllergyStrong would like to see a shorter implementation time of three to four years. The gap in allergen labeling on alcoholic beverage is long overdue and badly needed to prevent the complications of alcohol vis-à-vis accidental allergen consumption.    Background on food allergies: o 33 million Americans live with food allergies – that is more than 1 in 10 adults. o You can be allergic to nearly any food – but 9 are responsible for 90% of reactions.   o Reactions are unpredictable and range from mild to fatal – each person’s food allergy can become life-threatening even if their last multiple reactions to the same food have been manageable.  AllergyStrong strongly encourages TTB to finalize the Major Food Allergen Labeling rule for many reasons:  1. Given the prevalence of food allergy, this is an issue of consumer safety.  2. The majority of people are not aware alcohol falls outside the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) – mistakenly believing that any consumable product is accurately labeled for allergens.  3. This misconception about current allergen labeling requirements on alcohol includes both individuals with food allergies as well as bartenders, waitstaff, and event personnel who may be operating on incomplete/incorrect information.  4. Currently consumers cannot access allergy information at the point of sale to assess a product’s safety – thus limiting what they can purchase or consume.  5. On-product labeling (the gold standard) or QR codes (if necessary) would be helpful to both sellers/consumers. Clear consistent labeling and a campaign to ensure customers know where to look for this information is most critical.    6. We strongly recommend labeling for the Top 9 allergens consistent with FALCPA and encourage voluntary disclosure of corn which is also prevalent (and even more common in Black and non-white Hispanic communities1) and incredibly difficult to manage for those who are allergic.  7. Currently consumers typically purchase alcohol outside of customer service hours, making it difficult to obtain allergen information if manufacturers are willing to disclose. Easy-to-access information will solve for this issue and may alleviate some burden from customer service representatives regarding allergen questions. o Information displayed via QR code/website should be displayed in multiple languages. For those with English as a second language, interacting with customer service is a difficult barrier to obtaining clear health information.  8. Alcohol is a cofactor that can complicate reactions by reducing the amount of allergen it takes to trigger a reaction2. Because of this, people with food allergies limit themselves to only a few trusted brands or stay away from any alcohol consumption entirely due to allergen concerns. Labeling for allergens would most likely expand their options, providing them the information needed to expand purchase/consumption options.  9. Alcohol is being used more and more in food products (such as barbeque sauces, stews, and reduction sauces), making it difficult to obtain clear allergen information on these food products.  10. Because a variety of major allergens are not widely used in alcohol products, labeling for the Top 9 allergens would allow producers to sell to new market.  11.  Wine and alcohol are labeled for allergens in Canada (where manufacturers must declare allergens and gluten in ingredient list or “may contains” statement) as well as in the EU.  Changing the allergen labeling for alcohol requirements would bring the United States in line with other Western nations.   Labeling for food allergens makes sense. Transparency and easily accessible allergen info is of great interest to allergic consumers. Once consumer safety is ensured, AllergyStrong believes we can expect an expanded consumer market for manufacturers, restaurants, bars, and other establishments where alcohol is sold.   Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.  Sincerely,  Erin Malawer Executive Director, AllergyStrong Allergystrong.org

Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003) 
 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) respectfully submits the following 
comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rule on major 
food allergens for the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. CSPI is a non-profit 
consumer education and advocacy organization that has worked since 1971 to improve the 
public’s health through better nutrition and safer food. CSPI publishes Nutrition Action and is 
supported by the subscribers to Nutrition Action, individual donors, and foundation grants. CSPI 
is an independent organization that does not accept any corporate donations. 
 
CSPI commends TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and 
protect consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the top nine major food allergens 
that does not exempt processing aids. We would support a variety of wording options for 
phrasing the disclosure (e.g. “Contains...”), provided that TTB adopts a specific required 
phrasing to ensure uniformity. Most importantly, we urge TTB to finalize the proposed rule as 
expeditiously as possible; U.S. residents have already waited more than long enough for this 
information. 
 
However, the final rule should be strengthened by: 
• Specifying where the allergen disclosure should appear. 
• Outlining specific formatting requirements. 
• Requiring species-specific disclosure for the labeling of finfish.  
• Adjusting the proposed 5-year compliance period to a 3.5-year compliance period, 
striking a better balance between giving consumers access to the information they need 
and want while still minimizing cost to industry.  
• Explicitly requiring the allergen disclosure to appear on-package and never solely via 
electronic means (e.g., via QR code), as this would place a barrier between consumers 
and this vital information. 
 2 
 
1) Background 
 
When Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 
2004, the associated House report documented the expectation that TTB would “determine how, 
as appropriate, to apply allergen labeling of beverage alcohol products and the labeling 
requirements for those products.”
1 It has been over 20 years since that bill was passed, but TTB 
has never issued final regulations applying allergen labeling requirements to alcohol.  
CSPI has a long history of advocating for transparency to protect consumers with food allergies, 
including ingredient and major food allergen labeling. In 2003, CSPI, the National Consumers 
League (NCL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and 66 other health and consumer 
organizations filed a citizen petition calling on TTB to require a standardized label including 
ingredients on all beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with an emphasis on the importance of listing 
common allergens.2 In 2005, TTB requested public comments on alcohol labeling,3 and in 2006, 
TTB issued a proposed rule for mandatory allergen labeling,4 but this rule was never finalized. 
Instead, an interim rule from 2006 allows voluntary allergen labeling.5 In October 2022, CSPI, 
NCL, and CFA filed a lawsuit demanding a long-overdue response to our 19-year-old citizen 
petition.6 In November 2022, in a letter responding to our lawsuit, TTB stated that it would 
engage in new rulemakings on nutrient and alcohol content labeling, ingredient labeling, and 
major food allergen labeling.7 
 
The present proposed rulemaking was issued in January 2025 and would require all TTB-
regulated alcoholic beverages to label the top nine food allergens using the statement “Contains 
Major Food Allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source(s) from which the 
food allergen(s) present is/are derived (i.e., milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, 
soybeans, and sesame). Unlike FDA regulations, the species of finfish is not required for fish 
ingredients. The proposed rule also applies to fining or processing agents, which are additives 
used in the production of alcohol. The rule allows for some exemptions, including for ingredients 
that are incorporated prior to the distillation process, in a manner such that no allergenic protein 
exists in the final product. The rule does not include any type size, formatting, or presentation 
requirements for the disclosure. 
 
2) Public Health Importance of Allergen Labeling 
 
Requiring allergen labeling on alcohol is a commonsense approach to ensuring consumers with 
food allergies have all the information they need to make informed purchases and stay safe when 
drinking alcohol. We commend TTB for proposing a strong mandatory allergen disclosure rule 
that does not exempt processing agents. 
 
Roughly 11% of U.S. adults have food allergies.
8 To help consumers with food allergies avoid 
allergic reactions, FDA-regulated food and beverages are required to clearly disclose the nine 3 
 
most common food allergens using their common name either in the text of the ingredient list (in 
parentheses if not already listed by the common name) or after using a “contains” statement.9 
Currently, TTB-regulated products are not required to disclose these allergens. Insufficient 
allergen and ingredient labeling puts millions of Americans with food allergies at risk of 
reactions ranging from mild to deadly. 
 
Without proper labeling, consumers may be unaware that alcoholic beverages often contain 
major food allergens. This includes wheat in many beers, shellfish in some micheladas (Mexican 
beverages with beer, lime juice, and sometimes clam juice),
10,11 milk in liqueurs such as Baileys 
Irish Cream, and tree nuts in liqueurs such as Amaretto, Frangelico, and Nocello.12 Additionally, 
additives authorized by federal regulations for use in winemaking include ingredients derived 
from fish, milk, and eggs.13  
 
Consumers with food allergies rely heavily on labels to help them avoid allergens. A recent study 
found that 71% of those with food allergies check labels for allergens every time they purchase a 
product, highlighting the importance of on-package labeling.14 In recognition of the importance 
of ensuring consumers have access to allergen information, Australia, New Zealand,15 Canada,16 
and the EU17 already require allergen disclosure for at least some alcoholic beverages.  
 
A March 2024 poll commissioned by CSPI found that consumers do not have all the information 
they desire from alcohol labels.
18 Big Village’s CARAVAN U.S. Online Omnibus Survey was 
administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, demographically balanced to 
represent the U.S. Census on age, sex, geographical region, race, and ethnicity. Of the 1,924 
respondents, 1,509 (78%) reported consuming a drink containing alcohol in the past year. 
Respondents answered questions about their level of support and perceived importance of 
alcohol labeling. An analysis of those respondents who had at least one drink in the past year 
found that 65% support required labeling of allergens on alcohol and 79% would find allergen 
information at least somewhat helpful when making purchasing decisions about alcoholic 
beverages.  
 
In addition to major allergen labeling, full ingredients labeling is important for the many 
consumers who have non-major food allergies. Over 170 foods are known to cause allergic 
reactions.
19 To ensure the safety of consumers with all types of food allergies, separately TTB 
should also publish the pre-rule on ingredients, which was previously sent to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB)20 and call for mandatory ingredient labeling on all alcohol.  
 
Below, we provide input on the questions posed by TTB in the proposed rule, with an emphasis 
on the importance of mandatory, on-package allergen disclosure, with consistent formatting.

3) Wording and Format 
 
As already noted, TTB proposed the language: “Contains major food allergen (s):____” and 
seeks comment on the content and placement of the disclosure. So long as the disclosure is 
mandatory, CSPI would support a variety of options for content and placement of the allergen 
disclosure, provided all ingredient disclosures on the label are required to be located in close 
proximity to each other. We also encourage TTB to move forward with mandatory ingredient 
labeling, on which the agency has not yet produced a proposed rule, as this will help consumers 
identify additional allergens beyond the top nine. 
 
a. Wording 
While the proposed language “Contains major food allergen (s):____” is useful, a more 
straightforward “Contains:” statement is also appropriate for major allergen disclosure. This is 
the wording consumers are likely accustomed to as this is the format often used for major 
allergen disclosure on FDA-labeled products.  
 
While TTB has not yet proposed requiring full ingredient disclosure for alcohol, certain specific 
ingredients are already required to be disclosed on-label. These include sulfites, FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, and carmine or cochineal extract.21–23 Additionally, a beer or distilled liquor that contains 
aspartame is required to disclose “PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.” 
Some of these ingredients, including FD&C Yellow No. 5 and carmine or cochineal extract, are 
also allergens. TTB has sought comment on whether such ingredients should be included with 
the allergen disclosure. 
 
If TTB adopts a simple “Contains” statement, in the absence of a mandatory ingredient list, TTB 
may consider allowing all ingredients that are allergens requiring disclosure to be combined in 
one “Contains” statement (e.g., “Contains allergen(s):______,” or simply “Contains:            ”), 
with the exception of aspartame which requires more specific wording and should remain in the 
current required format (i.e., PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE), as 
this may help to signal the presence of the ingredient to consumers with phenylketonuria for 
whom allergy is not a specific issue. 
 
b. Location 
All mandatory ingredient and allergen disclosures for alcohol should be required to appear in 
close proximity to each other, ideally directly adjacent to the proposed “Alcohol Facts” panel. A 
2021 analysis of the allergen labeling of products labeled for European Union regulation found 
that lack of a standard location for allergen information can make it harder to identify this 
information on the label.24 Including additional ingredient information (e.g., other required 
ingredient disclosures) nearby would further improve the ability of consumers to note any 5 
 
important health and safety information and prevent them from having to search through other 
material on the label. 
 
If TTB mandates ingredient labeling, TTB should also mandate that the “Contains” statement 
appear below, or immediately adjacent to the ingredients list, which ideally would be required to 
appear directly under or adjacent to the mandatory “Alcohol Facts” panel. This would align with 
how consumers are accustomed to finding this information on FDA labels, which requires 
allergen information to be either within, after, or adjacent to the ingredients list.9 If the allergen 
labeling requirement is finalized in the absence of a mandatory “Alcohol Facts,” the allergen 
information should be offset by a box to aid consumers in locating it. 
 
c. Within ingredient list allergen disclosure 
TTB is soliciting feedback on potentially allowing major allergen disclosure within a mandatory 
or voluntary ingredients list. FDA allows for disclosure of major allergens within the ingredient 
list provided the common or usual name for the allergen is used (or is present in parentheses next 
to the ingredient if the common or usual name of the allergen is not clearly in the ingredient 
name).
25  However, TTB should require that a separate “Contains” statement be present directly 
below the “Alcohol Facts” panel, regardless of whether a full ingredients list is mandatory. The 
separate statement, in either scenario, would most clearly signal to consumers when a major food 
allergen is present and avoid the risk that consumers will wrongly infer the absence of such 
allergens when such separate statements do not appear. 
 
d. Format 
Allergen information should be subject to the same general requirements that apply to all 
mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels including that the information is readily 
legible, on a contrasting background, and appear as text at least 1 millimeter in height for smaller 
containers and 2 millimeters in height for larger containers.26–28 The word “Contains” should 
appear in bold. 
 
4) Considerations for Finfish 
TTB is not proposing to require the name of the fish species when finfish is present in a product, 
instead allowing for the simple disclosure of “fish.” However, many people with a finfish allergy 
are able to consume one or more different species of finfish29 and solely labeling “fish” may lead 
consumers with specific fish allergies to unnecessarily avoid products. TTB should instead 
require that specific types of finfish be declared. This would align with FALCPA, which covers 
all FDA-regulated foods and requires that the species of fish also appear on the label.25 
 
In the proposed rule, TTB cites concerns that vintners and brewers using isinglass and fish 
gelatin as a fining agent often do not know what species of fish was used to make the product. 
While the burden of finding this out should not be on the alcohol producer, the problem could be 6 
 
solved if manufacturers of this product simply started disclosing the type of fish from which their 
products are derived. Notably, some products used for fining alcohol already have FALCPA 
compliant allergen disclosures (see Figure 1). In any event, asking vintners and brewers to 
ascertain exactly what fish is in their product does not seem like a major burden.

5) Distillation Exemption 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on the proposal to exempt allergenic ingredients that have undergone 
distillation from allergen disclosure given that no protein remains after the distillation process. 
TTB would require producers to be prepared to substantiate the absence of major food allergens 
only if ingredients containing protein are added to the product post distillation. We agree with 
this exemption. 
 
6) Allergen Disclosures need to appear directly on-package 
 
Allergen information is critical for consumers who have food allergies and should be listed on 
the physical beverage container. TTB is seeking comments about whether there are alternatives 
to on-package allergen disclosure, such as a QR code leading to a website with the disclosure, 
that would still adequately inform consumers. CSPI does not support an option to provide 
allergen disclosures via QR code as it would create an undue burden on consumers with food 
allergies, who would need to spend excessive time scanning QR codes in-store just to figure out 
if they can or cannot consume a product. They will be more likely to simply not scan the product, 
depriving them of potentially critical information. Additionally, accessing QR codes requires a 
7 
 
smartphone, which not all consumers have, and internet access with good reception, which not 
all stores and drinking venues provide.  
 
Barriers created by QR code disclosures would disproportionately affect consumers who are 
older or have lower incomes. In 2024, 84% of adults with annual household incomes less than 
$30,000 owned smartphones compared to 96% of adults with annual household incomes over 
$100,000.30 These data show similar sized gaps in smartphone ownership by age, with 79% of 
adults aged 65 and older owning smartphones compared to 91 to 98% of adults in younger age 
groups.  
 
Those living in rural or tribal areas would also be disproportionately impacted by lack of access 
to information if provided via QR code. A recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
report,
31 which included data from 2022, shows a rural-urban gap for access to high-speed 
mobile internet (defined as 5G-NR with upload/download speeds at least 35/3 Mbps) with 64% 
access in rural areas versus 98% in urban areas. People living in tribal areas also face lower rates 
of access to reliable mobile internet (78%) compared to those living in urban areas. Even rates of 
“fixed terrestrial services” (i.e., fixed broadband services excluding fixed satellite service) 
deployments at all internet speeds differ for rural versus urban versus tribal areas, with especially 
large gaps in access to internet speeds of 100/20 Mbps (which FCC uses as a benchmark to 
assess progress towards the goal of ensuring all Americans have access to “advanced 
telecommunications capability.”)  While 98% of Americans living in urban areas have access to 
fixed terrestrial service speeds of 100/20 Mbps, only 72% of those living in rural areas and 76% 
of those living in tribal areas have access to this internet service speed. 
 
In CSPI’s March 2024 poll,
18 adults who drank alcohol at least once in the past year were asked, 
“How would you prefer to learn about the ingredients, alcohol content, allergens, calories, and 
nutritional content of an alcoholic beverage?” Respondents could select one of four response 
options: 
1. Read this information on the label of the container 
2. Scan a QR code on the label 
3. Visit a website address provided on the label 
4. I do not want to learn this information 
More than three quarters (76%) of respondents who drink said they would prefer to read 
information on the label of the container, while only 11% preferred to scan a QR code. The 
desire to see this information on-package was particularly strong among respondents living in 
suburban (79%) and rural communities (78%) compared to those living in urban communities 
(70%) and respondents over the age of 65 (83%) compared to younger respondents (71% of 
respondents ages 21-34) (Appendix A). 8 
 
Because FDA mandates that this information appear on-package for all foods, supplements, and 
drugs it regulates, consumers are used to finding it on-package and therefore might not realize 
this information is even available if it is solely provided via QR code. For example, consumers 
might be accustomed to seeing “contains milk” on FDA-regulated products and then misinterpret 
the lack of an allergen disclosure on a TTB-regulated liqueur or canned cocktail containing milk 
to mean it is safe to consume. 
Recently, the European Union updated its regulations for wine labeling to include mandatory 
ingredients, nutrition declaration, and allergen disclosure. While the new regulations allow for 
some information to be disclosed via QR code, they specify that allergen information is always 
required to also appear on-package.32 
 
7) Compliance date 
 
TTB has proposed a compliance date of 5 years. This period is excessive and would further delay 
information that is vital for those with food allergies from appearing on alcohol products. An 
adjusted period of 3.5-years would better balance providing consumers with the information they 
need while minimizing cost to industry. According to FDA, food and beverage products tend to 
be voluntarily relabeled on a 2-5 year cycle, with most products undergoing voluntary label 
changes at least every 2-3 years.
33 
 
Generally, the cost of label changes includes new labeling equipment (if needed), and any costs 
associated with label redesign, printing, and administration. While extra staff time for mandatory 
label-specific changes may add slight cost, when label changes for regulatory purposes coincide 
with changes the manufacturer would have made to their label in any case, the analysis estimates 
that there is minimal additional cost for the label design change to the manufacturer. 
 
Per the cost analysis explained in detail in the alcohol facts proposed rule (referenced in the 
allergen proposed rule),
34 TTB estimates that for brand name products, 100% of changes would 
overlap with a regularly scheduled change within 2 years. Private labels, which make up a 
smaller share of the market, would be able to coordinate 100% of their changes by the 3.5-year 
mark. Additionally, the model estimates that there are per-UPC cost reductions in extending the 
compliance period from 2 years to 3.5 years, but from 3.5 years onward the cost per UPC does 
not decrease further. Similarly, the total cost would not decrease further by extending the 
compliance period past 3.5 years. 
 
Another metric used in TTB’s analysis, the total cost using a 2% discount rate, similarly sees a 
dramatic decrease in the total cost of labeling changes when extending the deadline from 2 years 
to 3.5 years ($323.4 million at 2 years down to $259.5 million at 3 years and down to $204.3 
million at 3.5 years). However, the reduction in price is far smaller when extending from a 3.5- 
to a 5-year compliance period, which reduces the discounted total by only ~$3 million more 9 
 
(1.5%). Based on TTB’s own analysis, a 3.5-year compliance period would be more than fair and 
strike a balance between minimizing cost to industry and providing consumers access to 
important and long overdue information in a timely fashion. 
 
To further minimize costs, we recommend that TTB align the compliance dates for the two 
current proposed rules (allergens and alcohol facts). We do not recommend coordinating 
compliance with the ingredient labeling pre-rule, as this would likely take much longer than the 
other two rules to finalize and could mean significant delay of the other two rules. 
 
8) Conclusion 
 
In the two decades CSPI has been advocating for allergen disclosure on alcohol, consumers with 
allergens have been left without access to this basic information that is present on nearly all other 
foods and beverages. 
 
Finalizing this proposed rule to require on-package disclosure of the top nine major food 
allergens on alcoholic beverages would be an important and commonsense step towards ensuring 
consumers with food allergies who choose to drink can do so safely. We hope that TTB will also 
move swiftly to publish and finalize the ingredient labeling rule to protect those with allergies to 
foods other than the top nine allergens.

Dear Ms. Greenberg:
Family Winemakers of California is a trade association which advocates for 
predominately small, family-owned wineries in California – most of whom produce less 
than 5,000 cases of wine/year.  Celebrating our 35th anniversary this year, our members 
continually contribute to the agricultural strength and economy of California 
communities.
We understand the importance of the role of allergens in the health and welfare of our 
consumers, and support providing accurate information to those customers. While the 
TTB regulations on fining and clarification do allow the use of some agents (albumin, 
milk, and isinglass) in the winemaking process, the “use” of these agents doesn’t 
necessarily mean that the allergen is present in the final wine. Labeling based upon 
“use” of a fining agent in the production of wine is not only inaccurate, but meaningless 
consumer information. Any residual agent in the finished wine is not only often 
undetectable, but if found, it is in a trace amount. It is also likely that the tertiary 
structure of the allergen will be sufficiently modified by the alcohol to reduce the 
likelihood of an allergic reaction. 
The use of scientifically established thresholds based upon the amount of allergen 
remaining in the wine is the only reasonable approach. These thresholds should be 
based upon not only presence, but more importantly on levels that are problematic. 
Family Winemakers of California is appreciative of the opportunity to comment on the 
proposed rule and is available for any follow-up questions you might have.

2025-0002; Notices No. 238 – Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear colleagues in the Unites States Enquiry Point,  
The United Kingdom appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to The Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 238 
on Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages notified to 
the WTO TBT Committee under G/TBT/N/USA/2183, G/TBT/N/USA/2183/Add.1.  
The United Kingdom fully supports TTB's efforts to ensure that consumers have the relevant 
product information to make informed decisions.  
Notice No. 238 on Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
• In the UK, food businesses must inform consumers under food law if they use any of 
the 14 Allergens as ingredients in the food and drink they provide and this applies to 
alcoholic drinks for both prepacked (bottled or canned) or those served in a glass. This 
includes sulphites and sulphur dioxide, which are among the 14 allergens and are 
commonly found in alcoholic drinks. 
• Alcoholic drinks with more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol do not require an 
ingredients list. In this case, the presence of any of the 14 allergens which are present 
and not clear from the name of the food needs to be indicated. For example, a bottle 
of wine must have a statement such as: ‘Contains: sulphites, milk and egg. 
• The United Kingdom appreciates TTB’s approach regarding allergens labelling for 
distilled spirits. As stated in the Notice, the production of spirits involves the distillation 
of raw materials in such a way that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the 
distilled product or distilled ingredient. I n the UK view it is therefore appropriate that 
the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply to major food allergens used before 
the distillation process.  
• We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing 
protein are added to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food 
allergens are listed on the label. 
• In addition, we would request that the US consider allowing operators to exhaust all 
their stock which was put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect.

A. INTRODUCTION 
Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) represents the wine companies in the industry and trade in the 
European Union. Its members produce and market the vast majority of quality European wines, with and without 
a geographical indication, and account for over 90% of European wine exports. Micr o and small and medium -
sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU wine sector, representing more than 9 9% of wine 
companies. 
In 2024, European wines accounted for approximately 64% of the volume and 78% of the value of total U.S. wine 
imports. That year, the European Union exported an estimated €4.9 billion worth of wine to the United States . 
This robust transatlantic trade reflects the enduring demand for European wines by US consumers.  
CEEV thanks the U.S. authorities for the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 238 (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003), 
which proposes mandatory labelling of major food allergens in wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. 
B. CEEV COMMENTS 
CEEV shares TTB’s commitment to improving consumer access to product information and supporting informed 
decision-making. In this spirit, we offer constructive input to help ensure that any future allergen labelling 
requirements appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of wine. 
CEEV believes that the proposed approach to allergen disclosure should be adapted to account for the particular 
role of processing aids in winemaking, the limited space available on wine labels, and the need for consistency 
with international standards. Wi thout such adjustments, the TTB’s proposal risks placing disproportionate 
burdens on EU wine producers, especially small and medium -sized enterprises , who rely on established 
international practices that ensure consumer safety without requiring mandatory labelling of allergens that are 
no longer present in the final product. 
In this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: 
 
1. Allergen disclosure for processing aids – presence approach and threshold 
CEEV raises concerns over the TTB’s intention to introduce compulsory disclosure of processing aids derived 
from major food allergens, determined by their “use” rather than by their “presence” in the final product.  
This measure would disproportionately affect wine products, particularly those utili sing albumen, isinglass, or 
casein as fining or clarifying agents, substances commonly used in winemaking, when they have been removed 
prior to bottling. 
CEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  
Notice No. 238 - Major Food Allergen Labeling for 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages    
 
 
 
The principle of “presence” is the basis hosen at international and at EU levels: 
- Under the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), major allergens 
“shall always be declared as allergenic food using the specified name in addition to or as part of the 
ingredient name when intentionally present in the food”.  The same Codex Standard defines processing 
aids as “a substance or material, not including apparatus or utensils, and not consumed as a food 
ingredient by itself, intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or its ingredients, to fulfil 
a certain technological purpose during treatment or pr ocessing and which may result in the non -
intentional but unavoidable presence of residues or derivatives in the final product”. 
- EU legislation  provides for Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011  on of food information to consumers, that 
requires the declaration of any ingredient or processing aid used in the manufacture or preparation of 
a food and still present in the finished product.  
In line with these principles, EU wine producers follow rigorous filtration techniques and good manufacturing 
practices, especially during fining and clarification, to minimise or eliminate allergenic residues before the wine 
reaches consumers. These practices are guided by resolutions from the International Organisation of Vine and 
Wine (OIV), such as: 
− OIV/OENO 427 -2010, which established the framework for identifying allergenic residues in wine, 
particularly those originating from protein-based fining agents. 
− OIV/OENO 520-2014, the Code of Good Fining Practices for Wine, which recommends best practices to 
avoid residual allergens. 
− OIV/SECSAN 709-2022, which updated analytical criteria to ensure precise detection and quantification 
of allergens, reinforcing food safety and consumer protection. 
 
Therefore, CEEV requests the TTB not to require allergen labelling for processing aids  for wine based on their 
use, instead of their presence . The “presence” approach for allergen declaration, ensures high levels of 
consumer protection.  
Additionally, CEEV request TTB to propose  a presence threshold that would trigger disclosure of major food 
allergens.  
 
2. Allergen labelling terminology 
CEEV requests the TTB to adopt the term “Contains:” followed by the name of the food source from which each 
major allergen is derived, in place of the more generic phrase “Contains Major Food Allergens.” 
CEEV considers that this terminology would offer greater clarity and legibility for U.S. consumers, consistent 
with existing labelling practices for health -sensitive ingredients such sulphites. The term “Contains” is already 
widely used and understood in the U.S. market . In addition, the use of this wording would align U.S. allergen 
labelling requirements for wine with internationally recognised standards, notably the Codex General Standard 
for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985).  
Under the European Union legislative framework, Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011  on food information to 
consumers, it is stipulated that if a food product does not include an ingredient list, any allergen present must 
be indicated using the word ""contains"" followed by the name of the allergen. 
These established international frameworks ensure strong consumer protection and promote regulatory 
consistency across markets. Aligning with them facilitates clear communication to consumers and helps avoid 
unnecessary barriers to market access for EU wine exporters, while also preventing complications for reciprocal 
trade by U.S. producers abroad. 
  
 
 
3. Certificate of Label Approval applications 
Considering the variability of wine, CEEV is in favor of the TTB’s proposed exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required statement of major 
food allergens. 
 
4. Implementation period 
CEEV supports the TTB’s proposed five-year phase-in period as a reasonable timeframe for wine companies to 
adapt to the new requirements. 
In addition, CEEV requests the TTB that, should the rulemaking under Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements 
in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages be adopted, its effective date be aligned with that 
of Notice No. 238 – Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Dist illed Spirits, and Malt Beverages, to ensure 
coordinated implementation and minimise disruption for producers.

with
 
the
 
FALCPA
 
House
 
committee
 
report
 
and
 
TTB's
 
statutory
 
mandate
 
under
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
to
 
promulgate
 
regulations
 
ensuring
 
that
 
consumers
 
receive
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
alcohol
 
beverage  labels  should  provide  consumers  with  sufficient  information  about  the  use  of  major  
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
so
 
that
 
consumers
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
may
 
make
 
an
 
informed
 
decision
 
as
 
to
 
whether
 
consumption
 
of
 
a
 
particular
 
beverage
 
may
 
pose
 
a
 
risk
 
of
 
an
 
allergic
 
reaction.
  Specific  Comments   Should  TTB  adopt  the  proposed  wording  of  the  major  food  allergen  statement  (“Contains  major  
food
 
allergen(s)”
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
colon
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived)?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  such  a  disclosure  only  if  there  is  a  detectable  trace  of  the  
potential
 
allergen
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
Quite
 
often
 
wineries
 
will
 
use
 
certain
 
fining
 
and
 
filtering
 
agents
 
that
 
will
 
have
 
no
 
detectable
 
trace
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  food  allergens  within  a  voluntary  ingredient  statement  
on
 
labels
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
  Producers  that  wish  to  disclose  that  information  should  have  this  option.   If  mandatory  ingredient  labeling  is  ultimately  adopted,  should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
ingredients
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
If
 
mandatory
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
is
 
ultimately
 
adopted,
 
should
 
TTB
 
use
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA's
 
approach?
 
Should
 
TTB
 
limit
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
only
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
  If  ingredient  labeling  is  eventually  adopted,  WineAmerica  supports  the  use  of  one  statement  in  
an
 
off
 
label
 
disclosure
 
as
 
one
 
option.
  Should  other  ingredients  that  are  required  to  be  disclosed  under  current  TTB  regulations  (FD&C  
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
one
 
statement
 
on
 
the
 
label?
 
If
 
so,
 
should
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
a
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
that
 
includes
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
(For
 
example,
 
“Contains
 
egg
 
and
 
sulfites”).
 
Or
 
should
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
be
 
identified
 
as
 
such,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
listed
 
separately
 
(for
 
example,
 
“Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg.
 
Contains
 
sulfites”)?
 
Should
 
another
 
statement
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
ingredients
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
under
 
current
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
(FD&C
 
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
to
 
differentiate
 
from
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  one  disclosure  statement,  if  there  are  any  detectable  allergens  
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Would  requiring  all  mandatory  disclosures  to  be  in  one  place  on  the  label,  including  the  
proposed
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement,
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
information?
 
Would
 
such
 
a
 
requirement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry
 
members
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
allowing
 
the
 
mandatory
 
disclosures
 
to
 
appear
 
separately?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  all  mandatory  disclosures  in  one  place  on  the  label,  but  this  
premise
 
is
 
exactly
 
why
 
the
 
off
 
label
 
disclosure
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
solution.
 
This
 
will
 
avoid
 
clutter
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
which
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
There
 
would
 
be
 
additional
 
costs
 
in
 
changing
 
any
 
labeling
 
of
 
a
 
product.
 
It
 
is
 
estimated
 
that
 
changing
 
each
 
individual
 
label
 
could
 
cost
 
up
 
to
 
$1600.
 
An
 
off
 
label
 
solution
 
would
 
be
 
most
 
cost
 
effective
 
for
 
wineries,
 
particularly
 
if
 
a
 
new
 
COLA
 
is
 
not
 
required.
  Should  TTB  mandate  specific  placement,  type  size,  and  presentation  requirements  for  major  
allergen
 
labeling
 
statements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
requirements
 
already
 
applicable
 
to
 
all
 
mandatory
 
information
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels?
 
For
 
example,
 
should
 
the
 
required
 
allergen
 
disclosure
 
statement
 
be
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
Or,
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
practicable,
 
should
 
TTB
 
mandate
 
formatting
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA
 
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  a  type  size  that  would  match  the  requirements  for  other  
statements
 
required
 
on
 
a
 
wine
 
label,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
and
 
the
 
sulfite
 
statement.
 
The
 
TTB
 
should
 
require
 
disclosure
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
format
 
or
 
off
 
label
 
through
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
other
 
web
 
based
 
disclosure.
  Other  Comments   Wine  is  a  unique,  value  added  agricultural  product.  It  is  made  in  all  fifty  states  by  nearly  11,000  
wine
 
producers.
 
The
 
wine
 
industry
 
provides
 
$323
 
billion
 
in
 
economic
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
economy.
 
Wine
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
produced
 
once
 
a
 
year
 
and
 
is
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
other
 
environmental
 
factors.
 
Wine
 
is
 
also
 
unique
 
because
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
follow
 
a
 
recipe
 
or
 
formula.
 
There
 
will
 
be
 
times
 
where
 
wine
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
additives
 
and
 
other
 
agents
 
to
 
filter
 
and
 
finish
 
the
 
wine.
 
These
 
are
 
almost
 
never
 
detectable
  
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  WineAmerica  is  in  favor  of  both  allergen  and  ingredient  disclosures,  as  long  as  it  is  done  in  a  
way
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
detriment
 
to
 
the
 
American
 
wine
 
industry.
 
Only
 
agents
 
that
 
are
 
detectable
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product
 
should
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
by
 
a
 
producer.
 
Additionally,
 
as
 
we
 
stated
 
in
 
our
 
comments
 
for
 
Notice
 
237,
 
an
 
off
 
label,
 
web
 
based
 
disclosure
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
option
 
for
 
the
 
wine
 
industry.
 
This
 
is
 
already
 
occurring
 
in
 
the
 
European
 
Union
 
and
 
should
 
naturally
 
be
 
an
 
option
 
for
 
our
 
producers.
  The  American  wine  industry  is  unique  in  that  it  is  truly  nationwide  in  both  production  and  
consumption,
 
and
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
wine
 
producers
 
are
 
small
 
family
 
farms
 
with
 
limited
 
resources.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
WineAmerica
 
proposes
 
that
 
any
 
potential
 
changes
 
take
 
that
 
into
 
account,
 
such
 
as
 
allowing
 
off-label
 
options
 
to
 
fulfill
 
any
 
requirements.
  WineAmerica  would  like  to  thank  TTB  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  proposed  
rulemaking.

Regulations and Ruling Division  
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau  
1310 G Street NW, Box 12  
Washington, DC 20005 
Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003) 
 
The undersigned organizations call on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to finalize 
the proposed rule mandating on-package labeling major food allergens and to propose a rule requiring full 
labeling of all ingredients. These rules will be a step forward, as current alcohol labels do not provide the 
information that consumers with food allergies need to make informed purchasing and consumption 
decisions. 
 
We commend TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and protect 
consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the Top 9 major food allergens without exemption 
for processing aids. The rule could be strengthened by specifying where the allergen disclosure should 
appear, outlining specific formatting requirements, and requiring species specific disclosure for the 
labeling of finfish.  
Major allergen labeling on alcohol is important because roughly 11% of U.S. adults have food allergies1 
and many alcoholic beverages contain major allergens, such as wheat in many beers, milk and nuts in 
liqueurs, and even fish and eggs used as processing aids in wine.2 Currently, consumers with food 
allergies have no way of knowing if they can safely consume alcoholic beverages because neither 
ingredient lists, nor major allergen labeling are required.  
Consumers desire this information and would use it when making purchasing decisions. In a March 2024 
poll of 1,509 adults who drink alcohol (commissioned by CSPI and conducted by Big Village), strong 
majorities of consumers said that allergen information (79%) and ingredients (88%) would be at least 
somewhat important for deciding whether to purchase a particular alcoholic beverage.3  
 
TTB should make clear in the final rule that this vital safety information should never be provided solely 
via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones 
or similar technology (including those who are older or living rurally).  
Separately, TTB should publish a rule mandating full ingredients labeling on-package for all alcoholic 
beverages. This would further improve transparency on alcoholic products and provide additional 
protection for consumers with allergies to foods outside the Top 9 major food allergens. 
Alcohol should no longer be exempt from the basic labeling of allergens that consumers with allergies can 
rely upon for nearly all other foods and beverages. To ensure timely consumer access to this important 
information, the final rule should adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year 
period proposed. 
 
We urge TTB to prioritize transparency by not only finalizing the proposed Major Food Allergen 
Labeling rule, but also by proposing a rule to mandate ingredients labeling on alcohol to ensure that 
Americans with food allergies can identify other ingredients that trigger allergy beyond the major food 
allergens.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including 
many small and family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of 
the nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   Wine Institute is 
committed to sound public policy at every level .  To that end, we provide the following 
comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 23 8: Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (“NPRM 238”). 
 
Science-based major food allergen labeling that properly identifies products containing 
allergenic protein capable of causing an adverse reaction can be beneficial for consumers 
with allergies.  Accordingly, we support the current interim rule which provides for voluntary 
labeling of major food allergens in wine.  That said, we are concerned that what TTB proposes 
in NPRM 238—which does not base mandatory labeling on the presence of allergenic protein 
at certain levels or at all—will depart from international standards, cause consumer 
confusion and other  unintended consequences, and will present enforcement issues and 
potential trade distortions that negatively impact US wineries.   
 
The wine marketplace is distinct in terms of both the number of producers and unique wines 
available.  A ccording to TTB, there are currently more than 17,500 bonded wine producers 
across the US and approximately 6,300 of them are in California.  Like our membership, the 
overwhelming majority of these are small, family -owned wineries that operate in a heavily  
regulated industry with correspondingly high costs  in establishing and maintaining their 
businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations be fiscally responsible, 
reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only if leg itimate public 
Page 2 of 6  
goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  We respectfully request that TTB 
consider our comments fully given that NPRM 238 constitutes a “significant regulatory action” 
that will impose new financial and operational burdens on California’s many great wineries. 
 
1. Allergen Labeling and Unique Aspects of Wine 
 
Pursuant to the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (“FALCPA”), food 
products that contain an ingredient that bears or contains a major food allergen (i.e., milk, egg, 
fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame ) must include 
this information on their labels unless the food ingredient does not cause an allergic response 
that poses a risk to human health or does not contain allergenic protein.   FALCPA does not 
apply to alcohol beverages that TTB regulate s under the F ederal Alcohol Administration  Act 
(“FAA Act”).  Instead, consistent with a 1987 Memorand um of  Understanding (“MOU”) , TTB 
worked with FDA in promulgation NPRM 238.  As TTB notes, however, the proposed regulations 
do not necessarily represent the views of FDA regarding allergen labeling or the requirements 
of FALCPA. 
 
Federal winemaking regulations authorize and limit the use of certain materials and processes 
for the treatment of wine.
1  These treatments include filtering, clarifying, or purifying the wine 
to remove  cloudiness, precipitation, or undesirable odors and flavors .  As TTB recognizes, 
some of these materials are processing aids derived from major food allergens.  For example, 
albumen (egg white) is approved as a fining agent for wine, and isinglass (a gelatin derived from 
fish) and casein (derived from milk) are approved to clarify wine  
 
Processing aids perform a function during production and are either removed entirely from the 
final product by filtration or remain in only trace amounts that are not always detectible.  Fining 
agents such as eggs and milk have been used in wine production for millennia with few, if any, 
substantiated adverse reactions from allergy sufferers.  And not all wines use these approved 
materials.  A winemaker will make a conscious decision to use a particular fining agent for the 
effect that it will have on the wine ; in most cases there are no suitable alternatives to these 
agents, as each agent has a very specific impact on the resultant wine.   It is also worth noting 
that due to legal drinking age regulations, the at-risk population under consideration should be 
only those members of the population over the age of 21 years.   Studies have shown that the 
vast majority of milk and egg allergy sufferers have outgrown their allergies by the age of 21. 
 
In sum, while TTB may work with FDA to inform a proposed rule for allergen labeling, TTB may 
also take into consideration aspects that are unique to wine and other alcohol beverage 
products over which it has jurisdiction under the FAA Act  and adopt appropriate measures 
such as establishing threshold levels for any allergens (i.e., a value below which it is unlikely 
that a food allergic individual would experience an adverse effect).

2. TTB Should Establish and Adopt Thresholds Before Imposing Mandatory Allergen 
Labeling 
 
TTB is not proposing any thresholds that would trigger disclosure of major food allergens.  
Instead, the proposed rule provides that all major food allergens and proteins derived from the 
major food allergens used in production  must be declared on the beverage label, unless an 
approved petition for exemption covers the product or class of products or they otherwise fall 
under an applicable exception.  TTB states that if FDA establishes thresholds in the future, TTB 
will reconsider its policy on this issue.   In short, TTB ’s approach is based on use —regardless 
of whether any proteins derived from a major food allergen remain in the final product—rather 
than their presence in the product.   As described below, we  have concerns about this “use” 
rather than “presence” approach, and the absence of any thresholds. 
 
A Vast Majority of Countries Adopt “Presence” Rather Than “Use” for Allergen Labeling 
Contrary to what TTB proposes, Codex Alimentarius  and the OIV recommend “presence” and 
not “use ” as the trigger for allergen labeling.
2  Indeed, “presence” is almost universally the 
adopted standard.  We found almost 60 countries, including the 27 EU member states , that 
adopt “presence” as the standard. 3   We found only two counties that may take the “use” 
approach that TTB proposes.4   
 
Notably, the 27 EU member states  and at least six other countries  exempt isinglass from 
mandatory allergen labeling on alcohol beverages  after the European Foo d Safety Authority 
issued an opinion finding it was  not very likely that isinglass  used as clarifying agent in beer 
would trigger a severe allergic reaction in susceptible individuals  under the conditions of 
production and use specified in the application for exemption.   Moreover, Health Canada—a 
federal department responsible for public health—issued the following  position on fining 
agents in 2012:   
 
Although wines may be manufactured using allergen- or gluten-derived fining 
agents, mainly ovalbumin (protein from egg), casein (protein from milk) and, 
to a lesser extent, isinglass (protein from fish), the enhanced labelling 
 
2 Codex is a set of  internationally recognized standards for food and  labeling that two U N agencies (Food and 
Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization)  publish. International Organization of Vine and Wine  
(OIV) is an intergovernmental organization that addresses technical and scientific aspects of viticulture and wine.

requirements are only triggered under the Regulations if the protein, or a 
modified protein, including any protein fraction, from an allergen source is 
present in the finished product. 
After conducting a thorough review of the current available scientific 
information, Health Canada scientists have concluded that the use of 
allergen-derived fining agents does not normally result in any appreciable 
amount of protein from food allergens remaining in the wine, particularly when 
usual manufacturing practices such as filtration steps are employed.  As such, 
the use of food allergen -derived fining agents in wine production, following 
good manufacturing practices, is not expected to produce wine that would 
pose a risk to egg, milk, or fish allergic consumers.  Therefore, in most cases 
of allergen-derived fining agent use, the new labelling regulations for priority 
allergens would not be triggered.
5 
 
What TTB proposes—i.e., labeling allergens based on use rather than presence—runs counter 
to the approach that an overwhelming majority of countries adopt for allergen labeling. 
 
On a similar note , and here in the US,  the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program 
(FARRP) at the University of Nebraska asserts that “it is now well -documented that food -
allergic individuals have threshold doses below which they will not experience adverse 
reactions.”6  That is one reason why FARRP concludes: “Regulatory guidance on thresholds for 
allergenic foods is sorely needed to improve the quality of life for food-allergic consumers and 
to focus limited regulatory resources on the genuine risks that exist to these consumers.”7  We 
agree.  We also agree with FARRP’s positions that thresholds must be scientifically based, and 
sufficient evidence exists to allow the development of regulatory thresholds for some of the 
most hazardous allergenic foods.
8 
 
Without Thresholds, Consumers Could be Misled 
TTB proposes labeling a wine with “ Contains Major Food Allergen ” any time major food 
allergens or proteins derived from major food allergens are used in production, even if they are 
used only as  processing aid s and do not remain in the final product  at all or only in trace 
amounts.  This proposed rule could mislead consumers and present wineries with conflicting 
regulations. 
 
Federal and state laws prohibit false and misleading statements including on wine labels.
9   In 
many instances, analysis of fined wines will not detect residues of processing aids  derived

 Page 5 of 6  
from food allergens  and that get filtered out.  For example, if casein ( milk) is used to  treat a 
wine it will trigger the proposed mandatory labeling  “Contains Major Food Allergen: m ilk.”  If 
an analysis is done on this wine and milk protein residues are not found—which is entirely 
plausible—the labeling  declaration potentially constitutes a false or  misleading statement  
because it does not “contain”  milk or milk proteins .  In fact, TTB expresses a similar concern 
when it explains why it is not proposing  advisory labeling such as  “May Contain” statements: 
“TTB is concerned that allergen advisory labeling could be used as substitute for adherence to 
current good manufacturing practices and could be misleading.” 
 
Instead, T TB proposes that an industry member may  include the added parenthetical 
“(processing aid),” if applicable, so the full declaration in that scenario could be: “Contains 
Major Food Allergen: milk (processing aid).”  It seems unlikely, however, that many if not most 
consumers understand what the term “processing aid”  means.  In addition, since including 
“(processing aid) ” is optional, it may not always appear , even when applicable.  The better 
solution would be for TTB to reconsider the proposed rule and establish and adopt thresholds 
so that actual presence of allergenic proteins at quantifiable and problematic amounts trigger 
mandatory labeling. An alternative approach is to use the phrase “Processed with [food 
allergen]” if TTB determines that a warning is required.  This does not claim the presence of the 
allergen, but simply notes the allergenic material was used in processing the wine. 
 
There is also a related concern that a zero-tolerance environment will only become 
increasingly challenging as analytical technology becomes more sensitive, permitting 
vanishingly low and inconsequential levels of processing aids and other components to be 
detected.  Science-based thresholds will help to improve the information provided to 
consumers so that they can make clear decisions about what foods or beverages they should 
avoid, and to which risks they are exposed .  Science-based thresholds will also allow 
producers to more accurately meet the public policy goals of allergen labeling. 
 
Last, there may be unintended consequences  from adopting a “use” standard for labeling 
wines.  For example, a consumer who is allergic to milk may have consumed a given wine over 
many years and suddenly finds it now states “Contains Major Food Allergen: milk.”  That 
individual may decide since they have consumed  the wine for years without  issue, they will 
continue to consume it.  Current scientific and observational data suggests that if the wine has 
been fined according to good practices , that person will not suffer an allergic reaction after 
drinking the wine.  This may embolden them to consume other foods that contain milk allergen 
labeling and do pose a risk to that consumer.  This is another way in which a “use” approach 
may not serve consumers well. 
 
A “Use” Standard Will Present Enforcement Challenges and Potential Trade Distortions 
Since a “non-detect” result by analysis does  not mean that potential allergens have  not been 
used in making any given wine, access to production records would be necessary to confirm 
what was used in production.  This would require additional TTB resources and time to 
 
or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, 
scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression”).  Page 6 of 6  
investigate and it can only be done for domestically produced wine s and not for imported 
products.   If they have used potential allergens in production, winemakers exporting to the US 
will likely know that any remaining proteins are below the limit of analytical detection and may 
therefore choose to not declare something that lab analysis cannot detect.  US producers will 
then be placed at a disadvantage in the US market compared with imported products. 
 
3. A Five-Year Implementation Period is Reasonable and Necessary  if a Final Rule 
Issues 
 
TTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal 
Register.  While we suggest that TTB first undertake work and review research to establish and 
adopt reasonable thresholds that would trigger allergen labeling, we agree with the proposed 
five-year compliance period for any final rule and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing it.  
Five years would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new 
labeling processes which will help minimize —but not eliminate —financial and operational  
burdens.  It would allow ample time for public and stakeholder education and regulatory 
guidance.  It would also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, 
and advertising material and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in another rulemaking, 
five years is within the typical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according to an 
FDA regulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.
10   
 
We also agree with TTB ’s proposal that industry members should not be required to submit 
new COLA applications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion of a 
statement of major food allergens.   That too will help alleviate some of the ongoing financial 
and operational burdens  which is important given the proposed rule is considered a 
“significant regulatory action.”

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238; Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To whom it may concern: 
 
As the association for the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) industry, including makers of food, 
beverage, personal care, and household products, the Consumer Brands Association champions 
the industry that makes the products you choose and the brands you trust. From household and 
personal care to food and beverage products, the consumer  packaged goods (CPG) industry 
plays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy, contributing $2.5 trillion to U.S. GDP and 
supporting 22.3 million American jobs. Consumer Brands advocates for uniform, workable, and 
durable regulatory frameworks that are informed by risk -based science, promote consumer 
choice, and build consumer trust across the sectors we represent. As such, we appreciate the 
opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol, and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB or the 
Agency) proposed rule titled, “Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.” (Proposed Rule).  
 
As TTB develops labelling standards for most wine, spirits and malt beverages, we encourage it 
to allow  for the use of digital technologies to share labelling information with consumers. 
Succinctly, we urge the agency to be flexible in how labeling information is provided, 
including recognizing the valuable role that digital disclosure tools like SmartLabel can 
provide in facilitating accurate and up -to-date information ultimately leading to greater 
transparency for consumers.   
 
Introduction 
 
SmartLabel® by Consumer Brands Association is a nimble, adaptable digital platform launched 
in 2015 by brand owners and grocery retailers to give consumers access to more detailed product 
information than could ever fit on a package. SmartLabel serves as the defacto standard for  
consumer transparency and allows brands to display state and federally mandated and voluntary 
label information . Currently 80 parent companies participate in the SmartLabel program, 
representing more than 1,000 brands and over 100,000 products across all CPG categories, the 
largest being food and beverage. SmartLabel data is maintained by the participating brands who 
can provide  up-to-date product information with the click of a button. SmartLabel can easily 
accommodate the addition of data for wine, spirits and malt beverages.  
 
Further, SmartLabel can augment  federally required nutritional, ingredient , and allergen 
information with voluntary details that go beyond the package label such as ingredient definitions 
and sourcing  information, links to allergy prevention and management resources , as well as  SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025

sustainability attributes and practices.  Much of the voluntary information in SmartLabel spans 
nutrition, product claims,  certifications, and disclosures that consumers really care about.  
Consumers interacted with the SmartLabel platform over 22 million times in calendar year 2024. 
A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands 
Association found that consumers most often view the nutrition, ingredient , and allergen 
information on the SmartLabel pages. The survey also found that one-third of consumers have 
used SmartLabel and/or scanned a QR code to access product information  and 97% of those  
have used SmartLabel more than once. Almost six in ten (59%) American adults are likely to trust 
brands that feature SmartLabel, and more than half (55%) of consumers believe that integrating 
product information with SmartLabel will improve their impression of the brand. Consequently, 
SmartLabel food labeling provides the product information consumers seek to make informed 
decisions about the CPG products they purchase. 
 
SmartLabel Standardizes the Product Data Display 
 
SmartLabel complies with GS1 data standards (sourced via the Global Data Synchronisation 
Network or GDSN) for all attributes displayed on the platform and is a single source of up-to-date 
and accurate CPG product details because the data is directly owned, managed, updated, and 
hosted by the brand owner or the brand owner’s solution provider. Further, SmartLabel utilizes a 
uniform display and structure, which facilitates the ability of consumers to quickly and easily find 
the information they are seeking.  
 
SmartLabel can play an important role in providing accurate and up-to-date product information 
about alcoholic beverages to consumers.  SmartLabel data is displayed in a consistent 5 -tab 
template for all product categories  (Food and Beverage, Household Cleaning, Personal Care, 
Over-the-Counter Medications, Dietary Supplements and Pet Food)  and includes 
all federally mandated information that would be required to appear on the label  
(except for date code labeling for infant formula, which must be provided for the 
specific packaged product). For food and beverage products, the tabs are Nutrition, 
Ingredients, Allergens, About this Product (most of the voluntary information, 
including claims, resides on this tab) and Company, Brand & Sustainability.

The product image in the header of all SmartLabel pages can be clicked to display an enlarged 
image to aid consumers in determining if the product they have in hand matches the SmartLabel 
information. 
 
SmartLabel nutrition, ingredient, and allergen details are displayed in a consistent, readable 
template that mirrors the information on the packaging  and allows for variations in product 
formulations. The product image in the SmartLabel template header can be clicked to display an 
enlarged image of the package, which can be helpful for people with vision impairment. 
 
SmartLabel presents FDA mandatory information (nutrition information, ingredients, allergens, 
statement of identity, net quantity of contents, name and place of business, percent juice 
declaration and flavor labeling where applicable) in a consistent, easy to access and easy to read 
format. The SmartLabel program uses implementation manuals working with brands to provide 
information in accordance with applicable regulations for a consistent, reliable experience for 
consumers. For instances, the implementation manual for food and beverage prescribes that “the 
Nutrition Panel must exactly mirror what appears on the physical package for single column 
displays. ‘Exactly’ refers to all elements of the FDA’s Nutrition Facts label design including relative 
font sizes, indentations, alignment, and separation bar width. The Nutrition tab is not constrained 
by package size so the Nutrition Facts Panel should follow the FDA guidelines without truncation.” 
SmartLabel could implement a template that meets Alcohol/Serving Facts labelling requirements 
if any.  
 
The SmartLabel Trademark Licensing Agreement signed by all SmartLabel participants requires 
them to adhere to the specifications in the SmartLabel Food and Beverage Implementation 
Manual for the design and content in their SmartLabel pages. The program con ducts annual 
reviews of SmartLabel pages to make certain the data is consistent between the product 
packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page. Elements that do not comply with 
programmatic and / or regulatory requirements are identified, and brands are given a reasonable 
time frame to bring their pages into compliance.   
 
SmartLabel is Accessible 
 
SmartLabel product pages can be accessed easily in several different ways including 
smartphones, tablets, and computers – and allow users to view the information in an easily legible 
format regardless of device . SmartLabel pages appear in the browser and do not require any 
software to download or install to view SmartLabel.   
 
Consumers commonly use the native camera app on a smartphone or tablet to scan the 
SmartLabel branded QR code to reach the digital product information.  SmartLabel also offers a 
free application that can be downloaded for both iPhone and android smartphones. The app 
allows users to scan UPC barcodes for products that participate in SmartLabel. SmartLabel pages 
can also be searched and accessed using the Sm artLabel product database 
(https://SmartLabel.org/product-search) without access to the actual package. 
 
Given the ubiquity of smartphones and wide availability of broadband, consumers can readily 
access SmartLabel information by scanning the SmartLabel branded QR code. USDA’s 
Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS) has found that as of 2021, most Americans (97 percent) SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 4 of 10 
 
owned a smartphone of some kind.1 In particular, the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent 
of urban adults, 84 percent of suburban adults, and 80 percent of rural adults in America own a 
smartphone2. The Pew Research Center also found that 61 percent of individuals 65 and older  
own a smartphone.  
 
Similarly, QR code interactions increased by an estimated 6,200% between 2017 and 2021, with 
91% of consumers now having used a QR code at least once, and 87.1% of survey participants 
stating that QR codes are easy to use. 3 Moreover, internet access today is not the issue it once 
was. Today, 95% of American adults have reported that they use the internet.4  
 
Further, SmartLabel pages comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by 
the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Accessibility Initiative, which partners with 
organizations around the world to provide a high degree of internet usability for people with 
disabilities by: 
• ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility 
• developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and 
authoring tools 
• developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools 
• supporting education and outreach on web accessibility 
• coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the 
web 
• promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards 
 
The SmartLabel Template 
 
The SmartLabel landing page for food and beverage products is the Nutrition Tab, which 
replicates the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) on pack, including the FDA required formatting. In-
depth interviews from the 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands Association 
and FMI, revealed consumers found the product information in SmartLabel to be very clear, easy 
to navigate and easy to read. Consumers explained the digital rendering of the NFP in SmartLabel 
is easier to read than the NFP on-pack.

Ingredients are displayed on the second tab in descending order of predominance in a stacked, 
legible format. Many of the food and beverage implementors in SmartLabel also include voluntary 
information on ingredient definitions and functions , which can be accessed by clicking on the 
arrow next to the listed ingredient . The ingredients tab also supports information on ingredient 
sourcing and growing methods, providing consumers with valuable information about the products 
they consume.

The third tab, Allergens, displays a statement identifying the nine major food allergens under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Allergens contained in the product are listed in a stacked 
format, with the option for brands to also provide additional information on the composition of the 
allergen – for example, the allergen “milk” in a product might be composed of pasteurized milk 
and cream, dried milk , and cream cheese  – and links to allergy prevention and management 
resources. 
The fourth tab – About this Product  – displays voluntary information like claims, certifications, 
health and safety  warnings and product instructions. The fifth tab – Company, Brand & 
Sustainability – displays hyperlinks to the brand’s customer suppor t and website, company 
SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237

website, Dietary Guidelines for Americans and USDA My Plate. The fifth tab is also used to display 
product sustainability attributes like How2Recycle , Recycle Check, CIRT  and hyperlinks to 
corporate sustainability practices. 
SmartLabel is a viable option for manufacturers to provide product information, both mandatory 
and voluntary, that may not be as readily available or in -depth on the product packaging. Other 
types of detailed product information that are available to consumers through SmartLabel that go 
beyond what is commonly available on the product packaging  include information about, 
bioengineered food declarations, product certifications, sustainability attributes, and company or 
brand information.  
 
Additionally, SmartLabel informs consumers that a product contains a known allergen and, if 
provided by the manufacturer, can go further and advise if the product was made in a shared 
facility or even on shared equipment for hyper-sensitive consumers. 
 
SmartLabel Facilitates Data Management  
 
For CPG manufacturers, the processes for managing digital product content generally run in 
parallel with the changes made to the physical label. Manufacturers need to determine when the 
updated product and its label will be in market to identify when it would be appropriate to circulate 
the updated online retail information. This determination does not follow a specific timeline  
because it is based on the estimated turnover rate of the product that is in commerce.  
 
Manufacturers can update SmartLabel to accommodate reformulations in near real time . 
Furthermore, SmartLabel displays the  date of the  information up date in the footer of each 
SmartLabel page: 
 
 
 
 
Consumer Research Validates SmartLabel as a Digital Transparency Tool 
 
Through consumer research , SmartLabel has confirmed that consumers expect the labeling 
information in SmartLabel to be consistent with the information on the label. As noted, the program 
SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 8 of 10 
 
conducts annual reviews of SmartLabel pages to ensure the data is consistent between the 
product packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page.  
 
Consumer research conducted in 2023 by SmartLabel nationally with 1,000 respondents across 
all demographic groups found that 43% of consumers are very likely to access more product 
information online (compared to what is provided on the label).  
 
For reasons related to their family’s well-being, 80% of respondents said they would like to know 
more about products than what is usually  on the package label . When asked about shopping 
online, 80% of survey respondents said they seek more information about a product when 
shopping online than when shopping in-store. 
 
The same survey found that 84% of consumers said they believe product information directly from 
the manufacturer is most accurate. SmartLabel pages are populated directly by the brand owners. 
 
Consumers also sa id access to product information in SmartLabel is faster and easier  to read 
than the same information on the package label . The 5 -tab SmartLabel template serves as a 
standard and ensures consistency in the way product information is displayed  
 
Digital Disclosure Provides Benefits to Manufacturers and Consumers 
 
The benefits of digital labeling accrue to both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers demand 
transparency and value the detailed ingredient, nutrition and health information  in SmartLabel. 
They appreciate the consistency of the SmartLabel design, its organized layout and the ease of 
access. Moreover, providing information via off -label, electronic means benefit s consumers by 
ensuring they receive the most up -to-date, accurate, and more comprehensive information  
directly from the product manufacturers.  A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents 
conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands Association and FMI found that: 
• 58% of consumers look for SmartLabel on products  and 51% are likely to buy products 
featuring SmartLabel. 
• 60% of consumers are likely to trust brands that feature SmartLabel. 
• Accurate and up -to-date product information and detailed product information a re key 
purchase drivers. 26% of consumers are willing to pay more for products that offer 
additional information through SmartLabel.  
 
For brand owners, the primary benefit of using the electronic or digital link disclosure option is the 
ability for the industry to rapidly and efficiently update product information, therefore minimizing 
packaging costs and packaging obsolescence. Updates are influenced by numerous factors 
including reformulations, supplier driven changes, supply chain pressures, packaging inventory 
turnover as well as limited vendor resources. Electronic or digital disclosure provides flexibility for 
manufacturers to quickly address product changes as ingredient supplies are updated and 
modified. A nimble and adaptable tool allows for efficient communication and transparency, 
ultimately benefiting consumers. with minimal disruptions to both the manufacturer and 
consumers.  
With SmartLabel, brands don’t need to touch their packaging as often, since changes can be 
made to the SmartLabel page on the fly. When a change is made on the SmartLabel page, it will SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 9 of 10 
 
appear everywhere the page is hosted in real time – on the brand ecommerce pages and retail 
ecommerce sites. In other words, with SmartLabel, manufacturers only have to make a change 
once, instead of on multiple platforms. As important, the ability to make real-time corrections and 
provide real-time information can streamline and aid regulatory enforcement efforts associated 
with any new and mandatory labeling rules. 
 
GS1 Sunrise 2027 is Just Around the Corner 
 
SmartLabel is collaborating with GS1 US in prepara tion for Sunrise 2027 – the transition from 
UPC barcodes to 2D barcodes (Digital Links). With a single scan on a smartphone, a GS1 digital 
link-enabled SmartLabel QR code will allow consumers to access nutritional information, 
allergens, sustainability and sourcing data on the SmartLabel product page. That same QR code 
can be scanned at the point-of-sale (POS) checkout counter for price lookup and a variety of other 
supply chain processes related to inventory management and recall readiness. More information 
on GS1 Sunrise 2027 and 2D barcodes can be found here. A June 13, 2025 article in Packaging 
World described how brands are piloting 2D barcodes today in anticipation of Sunrise 2027.

TTB Proposal on Allergen Declaration in Alcoholic Beverage Labeling 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published the 
proposal (Notice No. 238) ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food allergens in 
alcoholic beverages. 
Comparison of the TTB proposal vs. the Official Mexican Standard NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, 
Alcoholic Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and Commercial Labeling: 
Pursuant to  Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages. 
Pursuant to NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, Alcoholic 
Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and 
Commercial Labeling. 
Proposal to add the following legend to 
alcoholic beverage labeling: 
“Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"" 
followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is 
derived, for example, 
9. Labeling 
 
The labeling of the products covered by this 
Standard, in addition to complying with the 
provisions of the Regulations and other applicable 
legal provisions, shall be subject to the following: 
(…) 
“Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"" 
This wording differs from the current voluntary 
allergen declaration (interim rule,  T.D. TTB -53 
(71 FR 42260) which states that in alcoholic 
beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, 
primary allergens may be voluntarily declared 
on labels affix ed to the container. The 
declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of 
the food source of each allergen (e.g., 
""Contains: egg""). 
9.3 Mandatory Requirements. The following are 
mandatory sanitary and commercial information 
requirements: 
(…) 
9.3.7 Sanitary Information. 
 
9.3.7.7 List of ingredients. 
9.3.7.1.1 The list of ingredients must appear on the 
label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or 
creams and all these alcoholic beverages, which 
after distillation and/or before bottling use 
optional ingredient s and/or additives that cause 
hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy and are 
present in the final product. 
Definition of Major Food Allergen: 
 
""The proposed regulations define the term 
""major food allergen"" as any of the following: 
 
 Milk 
 Egg 
 Fish (e.g.,  bass, flounder, or cod) 
Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, 
or shrimp) 
 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or 
walnuts) 
 Wheat 
 Peanuts 
 Soybeans 
 Sesame 
 
The defined term also includes any food 
ingredient that contains protein derived from 
one of these nine foods or food groups, subject 
to certain exceptions. 
The following foods and ingredients have been 
shown to cause hypersensitivity and must always 
be declared: 
 
9.3.7.1.1.1 Cereals containing gluten, e.g.: wheat, 
rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybr idized strains, 
and products thereof; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.2 Egg and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.3 Peanut and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.4 Soy and its products, with the 
exception of soybean oil; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.5 Milk and dairy products, including 
lactose; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.6 Tree nuts and their derivatives, and 
 
9.3.7.1.1.7 Sulfite in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or 
more. 
Compliance Period: The TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date a final rule 
resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that food allergens must be declared in the 
ingredient list only if they are present in the final product, without the need for a specific warning, 
and only in liqueurs or creams, cocktails, and prepared beverages. 
On the other hand, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the example 
""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". Furthermore, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim rule, T.D. TTB-53 
(71 FR 42260)) establishes that in alcoholic beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, p rimary 
allergens may be voluntarily declared on labels.  The declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the food source of each allergen (e.g., ""Contains: 
egg""). However, the TTB proposal seeks to make allergen declaration mandatory. It should be noted 
that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in distilled alcoholic beverages, 
provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes a distillation process that completely 
removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled product or ingredient. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including 
the following: 
 “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived; or 
 A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that adding 
an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real benefit to the 
consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which would go against 
Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks 
to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers. The CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the 
General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), recommends that allergen 
declaration be preferably done within the ingredient list.  In cases where a separate declaration is 
required, it should be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the 
allergen and, when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.  The 
interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily 
declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include the word ""Contains"", 
followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as ""Contains: egg"". It is proposed 
that the TTB consider the possibility of declaring major allergens as part of the ingredient list, which 
is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients that 
cause hypersensitivity and are present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for 
the consumer to understand and would be in line with the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developme nt (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and that 
excessive information can confuse the consumer. If it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic beverage labeling, it 
is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to provide additional information.  
This can be achieved through electronic labeling, using a QR code, a digital medium, or a website. 
This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited space for consumer information, presenting it 
in a friendly and easy-to-understand format. In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in 
regulatory provisions, and facilitates information reaching young people, a vulnerable g roup, to 
prevent harmful alcohol consumption.  It also allows for the development of educational and 
interactive content for the consumer.  Thus, consumers would be effectively informed without 
overloading alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement 
on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To clearly 
and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed that it be sufficient to include them in 
the product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name.  It is 
also proposed to consider the use of e lectronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to 
display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of  ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of 
the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient list, 
including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section.  It is also suggested to 
evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display detailed 
allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C 
Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) be required to be listed in one 
statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement 
that includes the major food allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the 
major food allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another statement be 
used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, as they 
can easily identify them on the label.  Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic labeling (QR 
codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding  overloading the 
physical product label. 
 5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including the 
proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this information? 
Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on industry members 
as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately? 
Requiring specific wording and location for allergen information on the label can create trade 
barriers and increase costs, negatively affecting the trade of alcoholic beverages.  Therefore, it is 
proposed that this information can be placed anywhere on the label.  According to studies by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), presenting too much information 
together can make it difficult for consumers to identify important data. To avoid this, it is suggested 
to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display 
additional allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements for major 
allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already applicable to all mandatory 
information on alcohol beverage l abels? For example, should the required allergen disclosure 
statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent practicable, should TTB mandate formatting 
consistent with FDA requirements for major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for allergen 
declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional costs for 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs could be considered 
a tec hnical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade 
barriers. This agreement establishes that technical regulations should  not be implemented that 
hinder international trade without valid justification in the legitimate objectives of member states. 
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985): 
Provisions for Allergen Labeli ng of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established that the 
presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. Should a separate 
declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains ________"" (or an equivalent term) 
and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient list, when present.  This provision avoids 
the use of a more extensive legend, which could confuse the consumer. 
Conclusion: 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic beverages 
be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs and barriers to 
international trade.  Likewise, it is proposed that the declaration of major allergens in alcoholic 
beverages be limited to thei r inclusion in the ingredient list.  Should an additional declaration be 
required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the CODEX Alimentarius and the 
Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)), using only the legend 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a more extensive text. It is essential that 
the possibility of using electronic labeling (through QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to 
provide additional information or legends about ma jor allergens be considered.  This method

Subject: Comments on: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance, a strategic collaboration 
among companies and with  institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable 
development of Mezcal. Its purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by 
disseminating good practices, promoting joint projects and generating a positive impact on 
producing communities. With a focus on innovative  solutions, the Alliance seeks to 
accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that defines Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB for notifying its proposed regulation to the 
TBT Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade 
Organization, in accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that 
notifications of technical regulations sh ould occur at a stage where comments can be 
considered and modifications to the initial proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. 
published the proposal  ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food 
allergens in alcoholic beverages.  The TTB has proposed a five -year compliance period, 
starting from the date the final standard is published in the Federal Register. 
Under the current interim standard (T.D. TTB-53), major allergens in alcoholic beverages like 
wine and spirits may be voluntarily declared using the phrase “Contains: [allergen]”. 
However, the TTB now proposes making allergen labeling mandatory, with an exemption for 
distilled products whe re the distillation process fully removes all proteins, including 
allergens. It should be noted that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in  
distilled alcoholic beverages, provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes 
a distillation process that completely removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled 
product or ingredient. 
Furthermore, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the 
example ""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 stipulates that food allergens must be listed in the 
ingredient declaration only when they are present in the final product, and this requirement 
applies exclusively to liqueurs, creams, cocktails, and prepared alcoholic b everages. No 
specific allergen warning is mandated. 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement 
(“Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or 
allow alternative formats, including the following: 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which 
each major food allergen is derived; or 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or 
other language and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that 
adding an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real 
benefit to the consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for m anufacturers, 
importers, and distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, 
which would go against Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on 
Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers.  
Moreover, the CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the General Standard for the Labeling 
of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1 -1985), recommends that allergen declaration be preferably 
done within the ingredient list. In cases where a separate declaration is required, it sho uld 
be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the allergen and, 
when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.   
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and 
that excessive information can confuse the consumer. 
The interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to 
voluntarily declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include 
the word ""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as 
""Contains: egg"". It is proposed that the TTB consider s the possibility of declaring major 
allergens as part of the ingredient list, which is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic 
beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients t hat cause hypersensitivity and are 
present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word ""Contains"" followed by 
the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for the consumer to 
understand and would be in line with  the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
However, i f it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic 
beverage labelling, it is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to 
provide additional information. This can be achieved through electronic labelling, using a 
QR code, a digital medium, or a website. This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited 
space for consumer information, presenting it in a friendly and easy -to-understand format. 
In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in regulatory provisions, and facilitates 
information reaching young people, a vulnerable group, to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption. It also allows for the development of educational and interactive content for 
the consumer. Thus, consumers would be ef fectively informed without overloading 
alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To 
clearly and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed to include them in the 
product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name. It 
is also proposed to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or 
websites) to display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion 
of major food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major 
food allergen statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopt ed, 
should TTB use the “Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with  
FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient 
list, including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section. It is also 
suggested to evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digita l platforms, or 
websites) to display detailed allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical 
product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
be required to be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other 
ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement that includes the major food 
allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the major food 
allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major  Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another 
statement be used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, 
as they can easily identify them on the label. Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding 
overloading the physical product label. 
5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including 
the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this 
information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens 
on industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear 
separately? 
Mandating specific wording and placement for allergen information may raise trade barriers 
and increase costs. 
According to studies by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), presenting too much information together can make it difficult for consumers to 
identify important data.  To avoid this, it is suggested to consider the use of electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display additional allergen information, 
thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
  
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements 
for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already 
applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for 
major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for 
allergen declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional 
costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs 
could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World 
Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the 
creation of unnecessary trade barriers. This agreement est ablishes that technical 
regulations should not be implemented that hinder international trade without valid 
justification in the legitimate objectives of member states.  
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 
1-1985): Provisions for Allergen Labeling of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established 
that the presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. 
Should a separate declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains 
________"" (or an equivalent term) and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient 
list, when present. This provision avoids the use of a more exte nsive legend, which could 
confuse the consumer. 
 
 
   
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic 
beverages be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs 
and barriers to international trade. Likewise, it is proposed that the declarat ion of major 
allergens in alcoholic beverages be limited to their inclusion in the ingredient list. Should an 
additional declaration be required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the 
CODEX Alimentarius and the Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 
FR 42260), using only the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a 
more extensive text. It is essential that the possibility of using electronic labeling (through 
QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to provide additional information or legends about 
major allergens be considered. This method facilitates access to relevant information for 
the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens.

RE: Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov 
 
On behalf of the over 33 million Americans who suﬀer directly from life-threatening food allergies, and 
the more than 85 million that are directly and indirectly aﬀected by food allergies and/or intolerances to 
one of the top 9 food allergens, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) appreciates the opportunity 
to submit the following comments to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the US 
Treasury Department on the TTB’s Proposed Rule, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FARE is the nation’s leading non-proﬁt engaged in food allergy advocacy as well as the largest private 
funder of food allergy research. FARE’s innovative education, advocacy, and research initiatives transform 
the future of food allergy through the advancement of new and improved treatments and prevention 
strategies, eﬀective policies and legislation, and novel approaches to managing the disease. Food allergy 
is a disease, not a diet. 
 
FARE estimates that over 75% of Americans with food allergy, over 25 million individuals, are of legal 
drinking age and can be harmed without food allergen labeling of alcoholic beverages, if they choose to 
consume. Our food allergy community needs full disclosure and transparency about food allergens that 
remain in beverage alcohol products—wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages—after manufacture 
and processing. This labeling need also extends to individuals with celiac disease as well. 
 
There has been a long history of discussion related to beverage alcohol labeling with alcohol content, 
nutrition information, major food allergens, and ingredients – in the US and globally. FARE urges that the 
top 9 major food allergens requiring labeling in the US must be disclosed – egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, 
wheat, soy, sesame, ﬁsh, and crustacean shellﬁsh – as well as gluten, on beverage alcohol products 
regulated by TTB. 
 
When the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) was passed, the House 
report noted that consistent with a 1987 Memorandum of Understanding between TTB and the Food & 
Drug Administration (FDA), the House Committee expected that the agencies work together to 
promulgate food allergen labeling regulations with respect to applicable TTB products. 
 
The World Health Organization’s Global Alcohol Action Plan, 2022-2030, notes that “… appropriate 
consumer protection measures through the development and implementation of labelling requirements 
for alcoholic beverages that display essential information for health protection on alcohol content in a 
way that is understood by consumers….” 
 
In recent years, FARE notes that many “hard seltzer” and other similar products produced and sold by 
many beverage alcohol companies with 7% or less alcohol currently follow FDA labeling regulations for 2 
nutrition, ingredients, and food allergens without objection. Additionally, sectors of the beverage alcohol 
industry have been labeling “Contains sulﬁtes” for over 35 years. Thus, FARE urges TTB to work diligently 
and expeditiously to ﬁnalize and implement this proposed rule as quickly as possible. 
 
A ﬁnal introductory note. Our food allergy consumer is highly brand loyal. For foods, data from our FARE 
Food Allergy Consumer Journey research showed that with clear and consistent labeling, food 
manufacturers could unlock over 19 billion dollars per year. A similar scenario could apply to alcoholic 
beverage purchasing. This can be a win-win for those with food allergies and beverage alcohol 
companies by adopting clear food allergen labeling. 
 
Speciﬁc Comments on the Proposed Rule 
 
Allergen disclosure terminology and naming conventions 
 
FARE supports including mandating disclosure and the language of “Contains Major Food Allergen (s)” 
and strongly recommends that TTB consider moving forward on requirements for full ingredient labeling 
to align with FDA food labeling regulations and guidance. 
 
FARE supports TTB’s proposal to require disclosure of the top 9 food allergens, when present in ﬁnished 
alcoholic beverage products as noted in Section V. A. 1. of the proposed rule, using a statement on the 
product label that states, “Contains Major Food Allergen(s): [name of food allergen].” At this time, this 
deviation from FALCPA and FDA guidance is critical as TTB has not issued a proposal for ingredient 
labeling of alcoholic beverages. This statement should follow the same format and type size, and 
placement requirements for sulﬁte labeling on alcoholic beverages. It must be placed either above or 
below sulﬁte labeling disclosure, when applicable. 
 
At present, FARE only can support the above statement to clearly articulate the presence of one or more 
of the top 9 food allergens when present in ﬁnished alcoholic beverage products. However, FARE strongly 
encourages TTB to propose and ﬁnalize labeling requirements for ingredients on alcoholic beverage 
products. Food-allergic consumers are accustomed to looking for allergen information in both the 
ingredient statement and speciﬁcally in the “Contains” statement on FDA-regulated foods and 
beverages. We believe that TTB should make every eﬀort to align with FDA regulations by requiring 
ingredient labeling and disclosure alongside mandatory allergen disclosure. This would facilitate the 
consistent use of the verbiage “Contains: [food allergen]” for disclosure of the major food allergens. FDA 
also permits other allergen information outside of the top nine allergens to be included voluntarily under 
“Other allergen information” separate from the “Contains” statement. TTB could take a similar approach 
to ensure appropriation separation. Once ingredient labeling is established, it would then be appropriate 
for TTB-regulated products to use “Contains: [food allergen],” along with similar plain English naming of 
food allergen ingredients in the full ingredient declaration. 
 
Regarding the question of combining food allergen and existing requirement for disclosure of the 
presence of sulﬁtes as “Contains sulﬁtes.” FARE believes that separation is preferred as both consumers 
with food allergy and those with sulﬁte sensitivity are accustomed to separate information and 
combining could lead to confusion or misreading label information. 
 
Related to naming conventions, FARE urges TTB to adopt the same category and species naming 
conventions used for FDA food allergen labeling within the proposed “Contains…” statement above (e.g., 3 
tree nuts [almond, hazelnut], or ﬁsh [cod]). This has been clear to consumers since the implementation 
of FALCPA requirements since 2004. 
 
Labeling disclosure location and type size requirements 
 
Further, FARE supports the proposed provision of disclosing food allergen information only directly on 
the label of alcoholic beverages. Such information must follow the requirements of FALCPA and FDA’s 
labeling guidance with, at minimum, use of TTB’s proposed “Contains Major Food Allergen(s): [name of 
food allergen]” statement in plain English to alert consumers of the presence of the top 9 food allergens 
requiring labeling. FARE opposes the provision of food allergen information solely oﬀ-label via electronic 
or digital means (e.g., websites, QR codes). This is supported by consumer feedback received on 
development of the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ﬁnal rule on its National Bioengineered Food 
Disclosure (83 Fed Reg 65814). The ﬁnal rule states, “The majority of commenters did not support the 
use of electronic or digital link disclosure in lieu of on-package labeling.” 
 
Food allergen thresholds 
 
The proposed rule in Section V. A.  5. discusses the issue of food allergen thresholds. To date, FDA has not 
yet proposed use of food allergen thresholds on food labeling, exemptions, and enforcement. FARE is 
supportive of the use of food allergen thresholds for the prior reasons and to control and limit the use of 
“May contain” precautionary labeling. In relation to advisory or precaution allergen labeling (PAL), FARE 
appreciates TTB’s recognition of the challenges that come with the use of precautionary or advisory 
allergen (PAL) statements and the recognition that such approaches should not substitute for good 
manufacturing practices. FARE’s comments on this proposal consistently note “when present in ﬁnished 
alcoholic beverage products” [Emphasis added]. FARE believes there are opportunities for TTB to learn 
from the challenges and future being navigated by FDA about employing food allergen thresholds in food 
regulations. Providing clear parameters around the use of PAL, and the potential use of utilizing allergen 
thresholds, oﬀers such an opportunity, and FARE urges TTB to maintain a strong, ongoing dialogue with 
FDA about food allergen thresholds. 
 
The issue of food allergen thresholds has been thoroughly addressed in recent reports from an expert 
consultation led by the Food & Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO/WHO) to inform work of the Codex Alimentarius’s Committee on Food Labeling related to 
priority labeling of food allergens, guidelines for the use of precautionary allergen labeling (PAL) 
statements, and ingredient exemptions. The science is very strong on the applicability of food allergen 
thresholds to not over-label the presence of food allergens and provide clearer information for 
consumers. This may apply to labeling of alcoholic beverages as well. FDA scientists were integral 
members of the FAO/WHO expert consultations, and the agency is exploring the use of food allergen 
thresholds in the US. Food allergen thresholds may be a very useful tool for TTB to employ to determine 
the absence of food allergens in alcoholic beverages, and when the risk of presence of a food allergen 
used as a beverage alcohol processing aid (e.g., ﬁsh ingredients for ﬁning) is determined by risk 
assessment via quantitative data. Until such time that absence of food allergen protein in processing aids 
used in manufacture of alcoholic beverages can be consistently determined, FARE does not oppose TTB’s 
proposed requirement for processing aids to be labeled as, for example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: 
egg (processing aid).’’ 
 
 
 4 
Exemptions 
 
In Section V. B. 1. & 2. of the proposed rule, TTB addresses and requests feedback on exemptions and 
distillation. These issues are complementary and supported by FARE’s discussion of the use of food 
allergen thresholds and our view that labeling is required only when food allergens are present in a 
ﬁnished alcoholic beverage product. FARE supports the use of petitions for exemption when no food 
allergen protein is present along with consultation with FDA. FARE agrees with TTB’s discussion on 
distillation and absence of food allergen protein when manufacturing alcoholic beverages, and supports 
the complementary rational of FDA actions and for TTB to ﬁnalize the distilled spirits regulations in 
proposed 27 CFR 5.75(b)(2) “to speciﬁcally provide that the mandatory labeling requirements do not 
apply to major food allergens used in the production of a distilled spirits product if they have been 
completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.” 
 
Compliance date 
 
Regarding compliance date for this proposed rule, FARE urges TTB to adopt a compliance date of no 
more than 3 years. Our community has needed and wanted this information for over 20 years and 
deserves it as soon as possible. 
 
Comments on Related Proposals on Labeling of Alcoholic Beverages 
 
In addition to this proposed rule on food allergen labeling of alcoholic beverages, TTB issued a proposed 
rule on “Alcohol Facts” provision of nutrition and alcohol content information, and a pre-proposal (since 
withdrawn) on ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages. FARE wholly supports the comments from the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) on the proposed rule for “Alcohol Facts” submitted to this 
docket. FARE urges TTB to publish a proposed rule on ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages for 
public comment as soon as possible. 
 
FARE looks forward to continuing dialogue with TTB and the Treasury Department on all food allergy and 
labeling issues. If you have questions, please contact Robert Earl, Vice President, Regulatory Aﬀairs, at 
rearl@foodallergy.org or 571-771-8582.

Comments of the Beer Institute Regarding NPRM 238 
 
This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 238, by which the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of specific allergens on 
all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol 
Administration Act (FAA Act). 
 
BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer 
importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more 
than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is 
committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal 
responsibility. 
 
BI believes TTB should closely follow FDA regulations in addressing allergen disclosures for TTB-
regulated products. With that background, BI responds in this comment to the questions raised in 
NPRM 238. For any question not expressly addressed, BI currently takes no position. 
 
TTB Request for Comment: TTB solicits comments on the wording of the proposed mandatory 
major food allergen statement and the possible inclusion of other mandatory ingredient 
disclosures. Speciﬁcally, TTB solicits comments on the following:  
 
Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen 
statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including the 
following:  
 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived; or  
 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived.  
 
BI Response: TTB should adopt the statement “CONTAINS” followed by a colon and the 
name of the allergen as the simplest and already recognized manner of disclosing 
allergens.    
2 
 
 
TTB Request for Comment :  
1. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement?  
2. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the 
“Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA’s approach? Should TTB 
limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens?  
 
3. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations 
(FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulﬁtes, and aspartame) be required to 
be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a  
“Contains” statement that includes the major food allergens? (For example,  “Contains egg 
and sulﬁtes”). Or should the major food allergens be identiﬁed as such, and the other 
ingredients listed separately (for example,  “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains 
sulﬁtes”)? Should another statement be used for i ngredients that are required to be 
disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, 
sulﬁtes, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food 
allergens? 
 
BI Response to TTB Requests 1-3 above: TTB should align with FDA rules on mandatory 
allergen disclosures. For example, TTB should provide flexibility for producers to use either 
a) a list of ingredients (voluntarily disclosed) or b) a “CONTAINS” statement. And if a 
voluntary ingredient statement lists an allergen, there should be no additional disclosure 
requirement. TTB should not allow flexibility in listing other ingredients that a producer 
must disclose under current TTB regulations, such as major food allergens. 
(For example, 
“Contains egg and sulﬁtes”). The major allergen declaration should be separate from other 
ingredient claims. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the 
label, including the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to ﬁnd 
this information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on 
industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately?  
 
BI Response: Provided all mandatory disclosures are conspicuous, producers should have 
the flexibility to separate required disclosures. Major allergen declarations should be 
separated from other compulsory disclosures. 
  
3 
 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Should TTB mandate speciﬁc placement, type size, and 
presentation requirements for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements 
already applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for major 
allergen labeling?  
 
BI Response: TTB should align its requirements with FDA’s allergen disclosure 
requirements. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB solicits comments on whether labeling alcohol beverages 
produced using ﬁnﬁsh protein merely as containing “ﬁsh,” rather than with the name of the ﬁsh 
species, provides adequate information to consumers. TTB also seeks comments on whether 
there are alternative approaches to this issue that would provide consumers with adequate 
information regarding the use of ﬁnﬁsh protein in the production of alcohol beverages.  
 
BI Response: We support using “fish” rather than the species' name. However, consistent with 
FDA guidance, TTB should not require an allergen disclosure if finfish protein used in alcohol 
beverage production does not appear  in the finished product or cannot cause an allergic 
reaction. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is proposing to require the disclosure of ﬁning or processing 
agents that are or contain major food allergens, with the option of including the added 
parenthetical “(processing aid)” and is soliciting comments on this proposal. For example, if egg 
whites are used as a processing aid for wine, the industry member has the  option of disclosing 
this on the label as follows: “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg (processing aid).” This is an option 
that industry members may choose to use, but they also may choose to list these agents without 
parentheticals. TTB is not proposing parenthetical statements for other incidental additives 
besides processing aids. TTB seeks comments on whether this proposal, which is generally 
consistent with FALCPA, will provide adequate information to consumers.  
 
 
BI Response: TTB should not require disclosure of fining or processing agents that do not 
appear in the finished product or that  cannot cause an allergic reaction.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB’s proposal does not speciﬁcally address allergen advisory labeling, 
such as statements that a product may contain a major food allergen, e.g., “May Contain (major 
food allergen).” TTB is concerned that allergen advisory labeling could be used as a substitute for 
adherence to current good manufacturing practices and could be misleading. TTB is soliciting 
comments on the use of allergen advisory la
beling.   
4 
 
 
 
BI Response: TTB should align its requirements with FDA’s allergen disclosure requirements. 
  
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is proposing in 27 CFR 5.75(b)(2) that major food allergens, or 
ingredients containing major food allergens, need not be declared on a label when such allergens 
or ingredients have been subject to distillation in such a manner that no protein, allergenic or 
otherwise, remains in the distilled product or distilled ingredient. As explained below, this is 
consistent with the position FDA has taken regarding the removal of proteins using the distillation 
process within the context of major food allergen labeling and gluten- free labeling of distilled 
foods. TTB is soliciting comments on this proposal.  
 
BI Response: Consistent with FDA guidance, TTB should not mandate allergen disclosures for 
ingredients that do not appear in the finished product or that can no longer cause an allergic 
reaction. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB solicits comments on whether the proposed compliance date 
would suffice to limit the impact on small businesses and to reduce overall costs of compliance 
while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed. TTB also seeks comments on whether 
the use of a single compliance date for any new regulations on allergen, ingredient, or “Alcohol 
Facts” labeling would provide consumers with adequate information in a coherent and timely 
manner while also reducing costs and other regulatory burdens on industry.  
 
BI Response: TTB should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 
238. This will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is seeking comments on whether the compliance date for this 
proposed rule should be coordinated with the compliance dates of other labeling changes that 
have been proposed by TTB, including Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, which proposed the inclusion of Alcohol Facts 
statements on alcohol beverage labels, as well as any proposals that may be aired as a result of 
the ANPRM on ingredient labeling. See  Notice No. 237. Promulgating the requirements for the 
ﬁnal label changes together would allow bottlers and importers to undertake all the label 
revisions necessary to implement these changes in one label change. For example,  it is TTB’s 
preliminary conclusion that for industry members that would be required to  make label changes 
under any new requirements resulting from the Alcohol Facts and the Allergen rulemakings, it 
would be more efficient and less costly to make changes to the label to accommodate both 
requirements at the same time. If the rules were instead promulgated and took effect at different 
points in time, TTB assumes th at the multiple distinct label changes would result in  greater costs.  
5 
 
 
TTB invites comments on this preliminary conclusion.  
 
BI Response: TTB should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 
238. This will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : Are there alternative ways of providing a major food allergen disclosure, 
for example, by allowing information to be provided through a website using a quick response code 
(QR code) or website address on the label? Will such an alternative method still provide adequate 
information to the consumer?  
 
BI Response: QR codes should only be an option for voluntarily disclosed information. QR 
codes or website addresses are not the best way to disclose mandatory allergen 
information to consumers. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Does the proposed compliance date suffice to reduce overall costs 
of compliance, and speciﬁcally the costs to small businesses, while ensuring that consumers are 
protected?  
 
BI Response: Unless the rule changes are extensive and require more time for full 
compliance, five years should be sufficient for a full compliance date. As noted, TTB should 
align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 238. This will aid 
producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will require multiple 
label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
  
TTB Request for Comment : Is there a shorter compliance period that would provide more beneﬁts to 
consumers while still limiting costs and potential impacts on small businesses? Speciﬁcally, 
would a 2-, 3- or 3.5-year compliance period suffice?  
 
BI Response: Unless the rule changes are extensive and require more time for full 
compliance, five years should be sufficient for a full compliance date. As noted, TTB 
should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 238. This 
will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : If a ﬁnal rule is issued, will industry members begin implementation 
of the labeling changes in advance of the compliance date?  
 
BI Response: Many industry members will begin phasing in compliant labels earlier than the 
compliance date as brands undergo label changes in the normal course of business. However, new  
6 
 
 
label lead times, even for existing products (not including new-to-market products), may take 6 
months or more. Industry members must update hundreds of distinct brands, labels, and package 
types. The rule changes proposed here and in NPRM 237 are significant regarding time 
requirements and cost.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : How might consumers beneﬁt from early compliance by industry? Are 
there any ongoing costs of compliance with the proposed rule that TTB has not addressed in this 
document?  
 
BI Response: Most compliance costs will be associated with the initial label changeover. Ongoing 
expenses might include additional analysis and ingredient evaluation, formula creation, and product 
testing.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB believes that a labeling statement with information about the 
presence of major food allergens in the production of an alcohol beverage will provide signiﬁcant 
beneﬁts. Consumers with these food allergies will be able to make an informed decision as to 
whether consumption of a particular alcohol beverage may pose  a risk of an allergic reaction. This 
proposal will also promote consistency in major food allergen disclosure across all types of food 
product labels, removing ambiguity about whether a product contains a major food allergen or 
not. TTB invites comments on its conclusion that consumers would beneﬁt from having this 
information available on product labels. 
 
 
BI Response: BI believes consumers would benefit from information on labels about major 
food allergens present in finished alcohol beverages, which  can cause an allergic reaction . 
 
Conclusion 
 
BI strongly encourages TTB to align with the FDA on reasonable allergen disclosures. Again, BI currently

The ACA represents more than 1,200 cider and perry producers nationwide, from small orchard-based family operations to regional brands distributing across multiple states. While our members vary in scale and business model, they share a commitment to transparency, quality, and agricultural tradition. We support the TTB's goal of ensuring consumers have accurate and consistent access to information about the presence of major food allergens in beverage alcohol products. We agree that clear labeling can help protect public health and build consumer confidence. However, we respectfully urge the Bureau to consider the operational realities of small, agricultural-based producers and to structure the rule in a way that delivers transparency without creating unintended burdens or confusion. Distinguishing Ingredients from Processing Aids We urge TTB to clearly differentiate between ingredients that remain present in the finished product and processing aids that are fully removed prior to packaging. For example, certain fining agents or fermentation aids—some of which may be derived from major allergen sources—are used temporarily during production but are filtered or racked out before bottling. In such cases, no detectable protein from the allergen source remains in the finished beverage. Mandating allergen declarations for such non-residual processing aids could cause unnecessary consumer alarm and potentially misrepresent the safety of the product. This approach would also be inconsistent with allergen-labeling practices in other food and beverage sectors, which typically focus on the presence of allergens in the final, consumable product. Guidance for Fermented Beverage Producers The ACA recommends that TTB develop a clear, practical allergen reference guide tailored to fermented products such as cider, wine, and mead. This guide should: Clearly define ""used in production"" versus ""present in the finished product."" Provide examples of common cider- and wine-making inputs and whether they require allergen declaration. Include testing thresholds or detection methods that can be used to verify the absence of allergens in finished products. Such a guide would help ensure accuracy and consistency in labeling, reduce the risk of over- or under-disclosure, and help small producers navigate compliance without costly guesswork or unnecessary relabeling. Implementation Considerations Should the allergen labeling requirement be adopted, it is important that producers—especially small operations with limited staff and resources—be given sufficient lead time to update their labels and production protocols. We recommend a phased implementation period of at least three years, along with technical assistance in the form of sample label formats, FAQs, and virtual office hours with TTB specialists. Conclusion The American Cider Association supports the TTB's intent to modernize labeling in a way that benefits consumers and promotes transparency. By focusing on allergens present in the finished product, providing clear industry-specific guidance, and allowing reasonable implementation timelines, the Bureau can achieve these goals while preserving the diversity and vitality of small-scale and agricultural-based beverage alcohol producers. We appreciate the opportunity to provide input on this important rulemaking and look forward to continued engagement with the TTB as the process moves forward.

First, the regulatory environment today poses a higher bar for agencies in issuing regulations because of various executive orders. Second, there remains a core question on the structure of the proposed regulations: should the threshold for label disclosure be whether the major food allergen was ""used in"" in the production of the wine, spirits, or beer or whether the major food allergen is present in the final product.

Re: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, 
Notice No. 238, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, 90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (January 17, 2025)  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Eilers:   
  
The National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) greatly appreciates the opportunity to 
provide comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on Major Food Allergen 
Labeling.1  For the reasons stated below, NABI believes that the Major Food Allergen should 
remain voluntary.  First, the regulatory environment today poses a higher bar for agencies in 
issuing regulations because of various executive orders.  Second, there remains a core question 
on the structure of the proposed regulations: should the threshold for label disclosure be whether 
the major food allergen was “used in” in the production of the wine, spirits, or beer or whether 
the major food allergen is present in the final product.  The proposed regulations adopt the “used 
in” standard whereas NABI argues that the “presence” standard would provide the consumer 
with more accurate information and is what the vast majority of consumer rely on. 
 
 
Regulatory Environment 
 
Notice 238 cites the Treasury Report on Competition as an impetus for revisiting this proposal.  
On February 9, 2022, the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, released a report entitled “Competition in the 
Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits” (Competition Report). The Competition Report was 
 
1 Prior to the publication of these notices, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) held two virtual 
“Listening Sessions” on these topics in February 2024, and NABI presented a statement and submitted a written  
comment at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/TTB-2024-0002-0416

required by Executive Order 14036,2 “Promoting Competition in the American Economy”. One 
of the Competition Report's findings directed agencies to review “[r]egulatory proposals that 
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers, such as 
mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been implemented.”  
The Competition Report contained several recommendations, including that “TTB should revive 
or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory information on alcohol 
content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”  Consistent with the Competition 
Report's recommendations, TTB revisited the issue of mandatory allergen labeling for alcohol 
beverages.  However, by Executive Order, dated August 13, 20253 the President revoked 
Executive Order 14036.   
 
Notice 238 was published before the current Administration took office.  The current 
Administration has issued several executive orders on the promulgation of new regulations and 
review of existing regulations to ensure “regulations [are] squarely authorized by constitutional 
Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome 
administrative state.”4   Any new regulations, especially mandatory ones, will be held to a higher 
scrutiny. A voluntary standard as opposed to a mandatory requirement is more likely to clear a 
review under the executive orders because it is less burdensome.  It is maintaining an option for 
the industry and not imposing a new requirement on it.    
 
Accordingly, NABI’s comments recognize the regulatory climate of the current Administration 
that was not present in February 2024, at the time of the listening sessions.       
 
Consistent with the above, NABI respectfully recommends that the major food allergens label 
disclosure continue as a voluntary label provision in the regulations and not a mandatory one and 
should be assessable through a Quick Response (QR) code.

Major Food Allergen Labeling (Notice No. 238) 
 
Under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 USC Chapter 8, TTB is responsible 
for ensuring that the consumer has “adequate information as to identify and quality” of the wine, 
distilled spirits, or malt beverages from the label.  27 USC 205(e)(2).  Enacted in 2004, the Food 
Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) required food labels to declare the 
presence of each major food allergen using the name of the food source from which the major 
food allergen is derived.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administers FALCPA.  
However, the report of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce 
recognized that TTB has primary jurisdiction under the FAA Act for the labeling of wines, 
distilled spirits, and malt beverages.  The Committee directed TTB to work with FDA on 
developing its own regulations on major food allergens for beverage alcohol products under the 
FAA Act.5   
 
Initially in 2006, TTB promulgated a voluntary interim rule on the disclosure of the major food 
allergens and published a notice of proposed rulemaking to make the major food allergen label 
requirement mandatory.  TTB did not finalized the mandatory proposal; rather, the interim 
regulations remain in effect. The regulations in Notice No. 238, now propose to make the major 
food allergen labeling mandatory.   
 
Voluntary Disclosure of Major Food Allergens 
 
NABI urges TTB to maintain the voluntary nature of the major food allergen disclosure because 
of the testing costs that would be necessary for imported products.  This cost could arise with 
every import shipment of wine, spirits, or beer in order to confirm or guarantee that no major 
food allergen is present in the imported product.  The Supplementary Information states “TTB 
notes that this proposal does not require additional analytical testing, as it generally requires 
labeling of major food allergens used as an ingredient, and ingredients are expected to be known 
by the producer.”6   In the majority of these shipments, the importer is not the producer or may 
be purchasing the products from an exporter in the other country who also is not the producer.  
Shipment-by-shipment testing is the only way for the importer to confirm the absence of a major 
food allergen.  The five-year implementation period does not address or mitigate this concern.  
 
Moreover, the pivotal question is determining the standard that triggers the label disclosure of 
this information to the consumer.  In order not to mislead the consumer, the disclosure, if any, 
must be scientifically accurate regarding the end product for consumers.  The proposed 
regulations adopt a threshold of whether the major food allergen was “used in” the production of 
the wine, spirits, or beer is not as accurate for the consumer as is whether it is “present” in the 
final product.  For example, under the “used in” production standard “Fish” would have to be 
disclosed in all cases whereas under the “presence” standard this would have to be disclosed 
only where the fish protein remains in the final wine or beer.  For this reason, NABI supports the 
“presence” standard.    
 
 
5 H.R. Rep. No. 608, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., at 3 (2004).   
6 90 Federal Register 5774 (January 17, 2025). 4 
 
This distinction is important for importers.  Importers of bottled, canned, or other consumer 
ready containers would need to obtain the allergen content information from the exporter who 
may or may not be the producer of the product.  The proposed rule explains that no additional 
testing needs to be untaken because the producer is generally assumed to know whether major 
allergens were “used” in the production process.  For some imported products, this information 
may be difficult to obtain from the foreign producer or exporter so additional testing would be 
required.  The “presence” standard would facilitate this additional testing more than would the 
“used in” standard.   
 
Finally, one of the questions for comment is whether the caption on the label should be 
“Contains:” or “Contains Major Food Allergens:”.  The use of the “presence” standard is more 
consistent with the term “Contains.”   
 
Disclosure of Other Additives 
 
Adoption of the proposed regulations would result in two categories of public health information 
on additives, fermenting material, and fining agents in the regulations.  Current TTB regulations7 
require the disclosure of FD&C Yellow #5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame 
(in the case of distilled spirits and malt beverages8). These are not major food allergens.  The 
major food allergens are the second category and are Milk, Egg, Fish (for example, bass, 
flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (for example crab, lobster, or shrimp, tree nuts (for 
example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.  
 
Accordingly, NABI believes that these two elements of information may appear adjacent on the 
label as long as the consumer readily understands that the additives are not major food allergens.      
 
Major Food Allergens – FDA and TTB Regulations 
 
In preparing the proposed regulations, TTB has relied heavily on and deferred to the FDA 
regulatory framework on major food allergens while also noting in the NPRM where it proposes 
a variation.  The Supplementary Information explains “it is TTB's responsibility to implement 
allergen labeling regulations that are appropriate for alcohol beverages, as noted in the FALCPA 
House committee report.”9 
 
For example, fish is a major food allergen and the species of fish is required to be disclosed 
under the FALCPA.  Wineries and brewers use isinglass and fish gelatin as a fining agent but are 
generally unable to obtain the species of the fish used. TTB’s proposal will allow the disclosure 
term of “Fish” in this circumstance and not the species.  NABI fully concurs with this approach 
because it lessens the burden on the industry member and still protects the consumer who is 
allergic to a species of fish.

Quick Response (QR) Codes   
 
NABI supports the use of a QR code to convey major food allergen details to consumers.  The 
quality and quantity of additional information that may be given to a consumer via the QR code 
is enormous and, moreover, the QR code allows this additional information to be updated 
constantly at a cost to the industry that is far less than a paper label.   
 
Additionally, the QR code gives the industry member the opportunity to include some 
explanation about the major food allergen that would not otherwise be available on the limited 
""real estate"" of labels on the bottle or consumer container.  Moreover, broad generational 
acceptance of e-devices and I-phones necessitate their use today. Consumers today look for the 
QR code on a label as an information resource.

Re: Comments on TTB  Notice No. 238, Docket No. TTB -2024-0003: Major 
Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg: 
 
I write as President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirts Alliance (“ADSA”) to provide 
the collective comments of ADSA members to TTB’s Notice No. 238 entitled Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (the “Notice”).1  ADSA 
is a trade association of twenty member companies with common interests in the 
manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the United States.  
ADSA members produce over sixty percent of all the distilled spirits sold in the U.S.  
Previously known as the Presidents’ Forum of the Distilled Spirits Industry, ADSA traces 
its history back over 40 years.   
 
As in 2024, we support transparent labeling that protects consumers while avoiding 
unnecessary confusion or costs. We believe the proposed allergen labeling requirements 
should be carefully scoped, science -based, and technologically modern. Below, ADSA 
provides its comments on each key area raised in this rulemaking. 
 
Support for Allergen Disclosure Based on Finished Product Composition 
 
ADSA supports mandatory disclosure of allergens only where the allergenic substance is 
present in the finished product and poses a realistic risk to consumers. Many distilled 
spirits begin with raw materials such as grains or nuts that are entirely transformed during 
distillation. In such cases, no allergenic protein remains. Requiring these inputs to be 
listed would mislead consumers by implying a risk that does not exist. 
 
This approach aligns with long -standing U.S. Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer 
Protection Act principles and international standards. For example, EU regulations do not 
require listing allergens that have been fully transformed in production or when the 
product name clearly identifies an allergenic ingredient (such as hazelnut liqueur). The 
U.S. should avoid unnecessary, misleading, or redundant allergen disclosures that 
provide no additional safety benefit.

TTB-2025-0002

We support TTB’s proposal that the mandatory food allergen statement consist of the 
words “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is derived. For example: “Contains Major 
Food Allergen: milk” or “Contains Major Food Allergens: wheat and milk.” TTB should also 
allow inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement (or a 
mandatory ingredient statement, should such a requirement be adopted) rather than  
mandating a separate allergen statement. 
Further, the presence of a major food allergen statement should not affect the location of 
other mandatory ingredient disclosures, including FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract 
or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame. We also recommend that TTB not mandate specific 
placement, type size, or presentation requirements for major allergen labeling statements. 
It is possible to provide full transparency to consumers while preserving flexibili ty for 
suppliers in how allergen information is presented. 
We appreciate TTB’s intention to clarify that mandatory labeling requirements do not 
apply to major food allergens used in the production of a distilled spirits product if they 
have been completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the final 
product. We further support TTB’s plan to evaluate compliance through scientifically valid 
analytical methods capable of reliably detecting the presence or absence of protein or 
protein fragments in the finished product. We encourage TTB to broaden t his approach 
by stipulating that, for flavors or other ingredients included in a distilled spirits product, 
proteins from major allergens that have been removed by methods other than distillation 
should likewise not require disclosure. Once the protein has been removed, the allergen 
is no longer present and should not be treated as such for labeling purposes. 
Recommended Label Declaration Format and Placement 
 
Where allergens are truly present in the final product, ADSA recommends a clear and 
concise statement, such as ""Contains milk,"" displayed near required product information. 
We do not support long -form ingredient lists, which are both scientifically inaccur ate for 
distilled products and unnecessarily complicated for consumers. 
 
TTB should also explicitly allow allergen information to be provided digitally through QR 
codes or a designated website. This would enable producers to maintain concise on-label 
information while making detailed allergen statements readily available online . Digital 
disclosures are increasingly familiar to consumers and avoid the label clutter that can 
make key safety information harder to read. 
 
The food and beverage industry has already established a proven model for this type of 
disclosure through SmartLabel. SmartLabel allows participating brands to present both 
mandatory and voluntary label information —including allergens—in a consistent, easy -
to-navigate format. More than 80 parent companies, representing over 1,000 brands and 
100,000 products across consumer-packaged goods categories, use SmartLabel to 
share detailed product data, much of which could not fit on traditional packaging. 
  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 3 of 4 
 
A key advantage of SmartLabel is its flexibility and timeliness. Brand owners control the 
content and can update it instantly, ensuring that allergen information is accurate and 
reflects any product reformulations. This eliminates the lag time and costs associated with 
reprinting labels, while maintaining compliance and consumer safety. 
 
Consumers value and trust this type of disclosure. A 2021 national survey conducted by 
the Consumer Brands Association and the Food Marketing Institute found that consumers 
viewed SmartLabel’s product information as very clear, easy to navigate, and easy t o 
read. This positive reception shows that a digital format can successfully communicate 
important safety data while remaining user-friendly. 
 
TTB can follow this tested path by allowing QR code or web -based disclosures for 
allergens. Doing so would align alcohol beverage labeling with best practices in other 
regulated sectors, increase the accuracy and accessibility of allergen information, and 
help ensure that consumers have the tools they need to make safe, informed choices 
without sacrificing on-label clarity. 
 
Costs to Producers and Practical Alternatives 
 
Mandatory static allergen statements on every label would create significant costs. 
Producers would need to redesign labels, reapply for approvals, and potentially retest 
formulations. Each of these steps carries expenses that are particularly difficult fo r small 
producers to absorb, potentially reducing innovation and limiting consumer choice. 
 
Allowing QR codes as a recognized form of disclosure dramatically lowers these costs. It 
permits updates without redesigning labels or resubmitting for approval, accommodates 
seasonal or batch -specific products, and allows producers to tailor information f or 
different export markets while maintaining accuracy and compliance. 
 
Impact on Small and New Businesses 
 
Small and emerging businesses often lack the internal infrastructure that larger 
companies have to manage frequent label changes or absorb the high costs of allergen 
testing. Imposing static allergen labeling requirements without flexibility would 
disproportionately burden these companies and could deter new market entrants. We 
appreciate TTB’s careful consideration of stakeholder comments on mandatory ingredient 
labeling for distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages, and applaud its decision to 
withdraw the rulemaking on this topic. 
 
To address these challenges going forward, ADSA urges TTB to take a digital -first 
approach. Allowing QR codes would enable small producers to meet disclosure 
requirements without incurring excessive design, printing, or regulatory costs. Coupled 
with this approach, we strongly recommend a phased implementation period of at least 
five years and a single effective date for all labeling changes. Avoiding piecemeal 
rulemaking will prevent multiple rounds of costly modifications, giving businesses the 
ability to plan and budget effectively. Aligning this five -year compliance period with the  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 4 of 4 
 
new “Alcohol Facts” requirement  and confirming that new COLA applications are not 
needed when the only change is the inclusion of a major food allergen statement  will 
further ease the transition for industry members. 
 
Need for Ongoing Collaboration with TTB 
 
ADSA strongly supports continued collaboration between TTB, public health experts, 
consumer representatives, and industry stakeholders before finalizing any new rule. We 
recommend forming a technical working group to evaluate allergen risk, test QR code 
solutions, and develop uniform guidance on definitions, testing thresholds, and best 
practices. 
 
This cooperative process will ensure rules are science-based, feasible to implement, and 
provide meaningful information to consumers. We also encourage TTB to coordinate 
future rulemakings to avoid staggered or piecemeal changes that would compound costs 
and confusion. 
 
Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Modern, Flexible Labeling Standards 
 
The U.S. has an opportunity to lead in modernizing alcohol labeling through flexible, 
digital-forward solutions. The EU’s approach to allergen labeling has added significant 
on-pack complexity without proven benefit to consumers, often requiring labels to list 
ingredients that have no presence in the final product. U.S. policy should avoid this path 
by focusing on material risks and embracing technological tools like QR codes to give 
consumers more, not less, clarity. 
 
*     *     * 
 
ADSA appreciates the opportunity to provide input on Notice No. 238. We support clear 
allergen disclosures based on finished product composition and recommend digital 
disclosure methods to improve accuracy, lower costs, and avoid cluttering labels. We 
believe a hybrid approach that combines concise on-label statements with QR code 
access to more detailed information best serves consumers, promotes innovation, and 
keeps regulatory burdens reasonable. 
 
We look forward to continuing to work with TTB to ensure any final rule is science-based, 
practical to implement, and responsive to consumer needs.

Subject: Comments on: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance, a strategic collaboration 
among companies and with  institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable 
development of Mezcal. Its purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by 
disseminating good practices, promoting joint projects and generating a positive impact on 
producing communities. With a focus on innovative  solutions, the Alliance seeks to 
accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that defines Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB for notifying its proposed regulation to the 
TBT Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade 
Organization, in accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that 
notifications of technical regulations sh ould occur at a stage where comments can be 
considered and modifications to the initial proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. 
published the proposal  ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food 
allergens in alcoholic beverages.  The TTB has proposed a five -year compliance period, 
starting from the date the final standard is published in the Federal Register. 
Under the current interim standard (T.D. TTB-53), major allergens in alcoholic beverages like 
wine and spirits may be voluntarily declared using the phrase “Contains: [allergen]”. 
However, the TTB now proposes making allergen labeling mandatory, with an exemption for 
distilled products whe re the distillation process fully removes all proteins, including 
allergens. It should be noted that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in  
distilled alcoholic beverages, provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes 
a distillation process that completely removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled 
product or ingredient. 
Furthermore, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the 
example ""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 stipulates that food allergens must be listed in the 
ingredient declaration only when they are present in the final product, and this requirement 
applies exclusively to liqueurs, creams, cocktails, and prepared alcoholic b everages. No 
specific allergen warning is mandated. 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement 
(“Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or 
allow alternative formats, including the following: 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which 
each major food allergen is derived; or 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or 
other language and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that 
adding an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real 
benefit to the consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for m anufacturers, 
importers, and distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, 
which would go against Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on 
Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers.  
Moreover, the CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the General Standard for the Labeling 
of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1 -1985), recommends that allergen declaration be preferably 
done within the ingredient list. In cases where a separate declaration is required, it sho uld 
be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the allergen and, 
when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.   
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and 
that excessive information can confuse the consumer. 
The interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to 
voluntarily declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include 
the word ""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as 
""Contains: egg"". It is proposed that the TTB consider s the possibility of declaring major 
allergens as part of the ingredient list, which is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic 
beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients t hat cause hypersensitivity and are 
present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word ""Contains"" followed by 
the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for the consumer to 
understand and would be in line with  the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
However, i f it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic 
beverage labelling, it is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to 
provide additional information. This can be achieved through electronic labelling, using a 
QR code, a digital medium, or a website. This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited 
space for consumer information, presenting it in a friendly and easy -to-understand format. 
In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in regulatory provisions, and facilitates 
information reaching young people, a vulnerable group, to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption. It also allows for the development of educational and interactive content for 
the consumer. Thus, consumers would be ef fectively informed without overloading 
alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To 
clearly and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed to include them in the 
product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name. It 
is also proposed to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or 
websites) to display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion 
of major food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major 
food allergen statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopt ed, 
should TTB use the “Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with  
FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient 
list, including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section. It is also 
suggested to evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digita l platforms, or 
websites) to display detailed allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical 
product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
be required to be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other 
ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement that includes the major food 
allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the major food 
allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major  Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another 
statement be used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, 
as they can easily identify them on the label. Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding 
overloading the physical product label. 
5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including 
the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this 
information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens 
on industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear 
separately? 
Mandating specific wording and placement for allergen information may raise trade barriers 
and increase costs. 
According to studies by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), presenting too much information together can make it difficult for consumers to 
identify important data.  To avoid this, it is suggested to consider the use of electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display additional allergen information, 
thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
  
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements 
for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already 
applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for 
major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for 
allergen declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional 
costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs 
could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World 
Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the 
creation of unnecessary trade barriers. This agreement est ablishes that technical 
regulations should not be implemented that hinder international trade without valid 
justification in the legitimate objectives of member states.  
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 
1-1985): Provisions for Allergen Labeling of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established 
that the presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. 
Should a separate declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains 
________"" (or an equivalent term) and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient 
list, when present. This provision avoids the use of a more exte nsive legend, which could 
confuse the consumer. 
 
 
   
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic 
beverages be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs 
and barriers to international trade. Likewise, it is proposed that the declarat ion of major 
allergens in alcoholic beverages be limited to their inclusion in the ingredient list. Should an 
additional declaration be required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the 
CODEX Alimentarius and the Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 
FR 42260), using only the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a 
more extensive text. It is essential that the possibility of using electronic labeling (through 
QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to provide additional information or legends about 
major allergens be considered. This method facilitates access to relevant information for 
the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens.

Re: Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notices No. 237 and 238 – Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages; and Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director, 
 
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide comments to The 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding  Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notice 
No. 238 on Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
The SWA is the Scotch Whisky industry ’s trade association . We have over 90 member 
companies, from multinational spirits producers through to small family -run distillers, bottlers, 
blenders, and brand owners. Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky 
industry by production.  
 
Any rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the 
Scotch Whisky’s biggest market by value, with exports worth £971 million in 2024. In addition, 
many of our larger members are also investors in the United States. 
 
The SWA appreciates TTB’s approach regarding allergens labelling for distilled spirits. As stated 
in the Notice, the production of spirits involves the distillation of raw materials in such a way that 
no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the distilled product or distilled ingredient. It is 
therefore appropriate that the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply to major food 
allergens used before the distillation process.  Due to the same reasoning, the SWA does not 
recommend the adoption of allergen advisory labelling for distilled spirits . Proper distillation 
practices ensures that no protein is contained in the distilled product or distilled ingredient . 
Furthermore, allergen advisory labelling such as “May contain: [ ]” has the potential to create 
more confusion for consumers and does not provide clear actionable messaging regarding the 
presence of a major food allergen in the final product. 
 
We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing protein are 
added to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food allergens are listed on 
the label.  
 
SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice 238

For those products where the presence of allergens would have to be disclosed, the SWA 
welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. In addition, we would like to request the 
possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on t he market before the 
proposed rule comes into effect. 
 
We would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its 
implementation is aligned with that of Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, along with any other ingredient labeling proposal TTB might 
be considering. 
 
 
Yours sincerely,

Comment on Major Food Allergen Labeling  Docket No. TTB-2025-0003, Notice No. 238, RIN 1513-AC94  I support the proposed rule requiring labeling disclosure of all major food allergens used in the production of alcoholic beverages, but I would like to emphasize the critical need for a requirement specifying a minimum font size for allergen notifications on labels. Many individuals, including those with visual impairments, older consumers, and those with limited literacy skills, struggle to read small print on product labels. Clear and legible allergen notifications are essential for ensuring that all consumers can easily identify potential allergens and make informed decisions about the products they consume. For individuals with food allergies, the ability to quickly and accurately read allergen information can be a matter of life and death. Ingesting an allergen due to unreadable labeling can lead to severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Therefore, it is imperative that allergen notifications be presented in a font size that is easily readable by all consumers. To respond to a specific question posed by the TTB regarding the format of allergen notifications, I propose that the phrase “Contains:” followed by the potential allergen(s) is sufficient to convey the needed information. This succinct approach avoids unnecessary elaboration or wordiness, ensuring the label remains clear and easy to understand. There is no need to prominently state ""Major Food Allergen"" or similar terms on the label. Consumers concerned about particular allergens only need to see the specific allergen identified, and this will adequately serve the cautionary purpose. To enhance the readability of allergen notifications, I recommend that the TTB establish a minimum font size of at least 10 points for allergen declarations. (This is equivalent to a size of approximately 3.53 millimeters.) This recommendation aligns with best practices in labeling and ensures that the critical information is accessible to a broad audience. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have established minimum font size requirements for  2 
important label information to ensure readability. Adopting a similar approach for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels would be consistent with these established practices and promote consumer safety. Studies have shown that larger font sizes significantly improve readability and comprehension of label information. According to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), increasing font size on medication labels improved patient understanding and compliance. Additionally, organizations advocating for individuals with food allergies and visual impairments have consistently highlighted the importance of readable labeling. Groups including the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) and the American Council of the Blind (ACB) have called for larger font sizes to ensure that critical health information is accessible to all consumers. Establishing a minimum font size for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels is a necessary and logical step to enhance consumer safety and accessibility. I strongly urge the TTB to incorporate this requirement into the final rule to ensure that all consumers, regardless of visual ability, can easily access and understand allergen information.   Thank you for considering this important issue.

The inclusion of clear and consistent allergen labeling is long overdue. Consumers with food allergies must be able to make informed decisions about the products they consume, including alcoholic beverages. While food labeling laws under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) have significantly improved transparency for packaged foods, alcoholic beverages have largely remained an exception—despite the fact that they may contain common allergens such as wheat, eggs, or tree nuts. This proposal aligns TTB policy with well-established public health principles and reflects a necessary step toward protecting individuals with food allergies. Labeling allergens such as milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame—as well as any ingredient containing protein derived from these foods—is critical for safeguarding health and ensuring equity for consumers with dietary restrictions or medical vulnerabilities. The proposed five-year compliance period is reasonable, as it allows industry members sufficient time to adapt their labeling processes and reformulate products if necessary. However, I encourage TTB to explore ways to support small producers during the transition period to ensure equitable implementation. Overall, this rule enhances consumer safety, aligns alcohol labeling with broader food labeling standards, and promotes transparency in a sector where such disclosures are urgently needed.

 The  immune  response  can  be  described  as  a  defense  mechanism  by  which  the  
body
 
rids
 
its
 
of
 
potentially
 
harmful
 
antigens.
 
An
 
immune
 
response
 
that
 
persists
 
and
 
causes
 
damage
 
to
 
the
 
host
 
can
 
be
 
termed
 
as
 
a
 
hypersensitivity.
 
Type
 
I
 
hypersensitivities
 
are
 
commonly
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
allergies
 
and
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
antigens
 
that
 
trigger
 
type
 
I
 
hypersensitivities
 
are
 
called
 
allergens.
 
Examples
 
of
 
common
 
food
 
allergens
 
include
 
peanuts,
 
milk,
 
eggs,
 
fish
 
and
 
soybeans.
  
According
 
to
 
FARE,
 
Food
 
Allergy
 
Research
 
and
 
Education,
 
approximately
 
33
 
million
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
food
 
allergy.
 
These
 
reaction
 
symptoms
 
vary
 
from
 
uncomfortable
 
hives
 
and
 
angioedema
 
on
 
the
 
skin,
 
to
 
more
 
serious
 
conditions
 
like
 
asthma,
 
rhinitis
 
or
 
anaphylaxis.
 
  Currently,the  Food  Allergen  Labeling  and  Consumer  Protection  Act  (FALCPA)  
that
 
was
 
passed
 
in
 
2004
 
created
 
essential
 
guidelines
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
by
 
requiring
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
labeling
 
of
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
on
 
packaged
 
food
 
products.
 
The
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
from
 
The
 
Alcohol
 
and
 
Tobacco
 
Tax
 
and
 
Trade
 
Bureau
 
(TTB)
 
to
 
require
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
is
 
an
 
initiative
 
that
 
is
 
substantial
 
for
 
public
 
health.
 
The
 
comments
 
provided
 
in
 
this
 
document
 
lay
 
out
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
expand
 
on
 
the
 
minimal
 
requirement
 
of
 
providing
 
an
 
allergen
 
list
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
and
 
how
 
industry
 
can
 
best
 
adjust
 
to
 
the
 
new
 
compliance.
 
  There  are  alternative  ways  of  displaying  a  major  food  allergen  disclosure,  such  
as
 
the
 
example
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
TTB,
 
by
 
allowing
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
available
 
through
 
a
 
website
 
using
 
a
 
quick
 
response
 
code
 
(QR
 
code)
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label.
  
A
 
QR
 
code
 
enhances
 
accessibility
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
modern
 
consumers
 
by
 
offering
 
detailed
 
information
 
without
 
cluttering
 
labels.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
reduce
 
printing
 
costs
 
and
 
allow
 
real-time
 
updates
 
to
 
ingredient
 
disclosures
 
online.
 
However,
 
reliance
 
on
 
digital
 
methods
 
alone
 
may
 
not
 
adequately
 
serve
 
all
 
consumers,
 
particularly:
 
older
 
individuals
 
or
 
those
 
without
 
smartphones,
 
and
 
consumers
 
in
 
areas
 
with
 
limited
 
internet
 
access.
 
I
 
recommend
 
to
 
allow
 
alternative
 
disclosures
 
like
 
QR
 
codes
 
or
 
URLs
 
only
 
as
 
a
 
supplement,
 
not
 
a
 
replacement,
 
for
 
on-label
 
allergen
 
declarations.
   The  U.S.  Tape  &  Label  highlights  the  importance  of  a  well-designed  label  to  
capture
 
attention
 
and
 
communicate
 
a
 
brand’s
 
essential
 
information
 
about
 
their
 
product’s
 
cautionary
 
warnings.

communicating
 
allergens
 
to
 
consumers
 
to
 
increase
 
brand
 
loyalty.
  
 
The  proposed  compliance  date  appears  to  strike  a  reasonable  balance  between  
consumer
 
safety
 
and
 
industry
 
adaptation.
 
A
 
sufficient
 
transition
 
period
 
allows:
 
exhausting
 
existing
 
label
 
inventories,
 
spreading
 
out
 
reformulation
 
or
 
redesign
 
costs,
 
and
 
training
 
staff
 
on
 
new
 
compliance
 
protocols.
 
For
 
small
 
businesses
 
especially,
 
an
 
extended
 
compliance
 
window
 
helps
 
absorb
 
costs
 
and
 
avoid
 
disruptions
 
to
 
operations.
 
While
 
a
 
shorter
 
compliance
 
period
 
could
 
offer
 
quicker
 
consumer
 
protection
 
benefits,
 
the
 
practical
 
challenges
 
for
 
small
 
businesses,
 
like
 
supply
 
chain
 
disruptions
 
and
 
label
 
redesign
 
timelines,
 
may
 
outweigh
 
the
 
marginal
 
gains.
 
However,
 
TTB
 
could
 
consider
 
a
 
tiered
 
compliance
 
approach,
 
in
 
that
 
larger
 
manufacturers
 
meet
 
earlier
 
deadlines,
 
and
 
small
 
businesses
 
are
 
granted
 
additional
 
time.
 
So
 
as
 
recommended,
 
if
 
consumer
 
safety
 
risks
 
are
 
substantial,
 
a
 
phased
 
rollout
 
based
 
on
 
company
 
size
 
or
 
product
 
type
 
could
 
offer
 
a
 
compromise.
 
Many  industry  members  may  begin  adopting  new  allergen  labeling  practices  in  advance  
of
 
the
 
final
 
compliance
 
date,
 
especially
 
during
 
routine
 
label
 
redesign
 
cycles.
 
Benefits
 
of
 
early
 
compliance
 
include:
 
improved
 
consumer
 
trust
 
and
 
transparency,
 
reduced
 
risk
 
of
 
allergen-related
 
incidents
 
sooner,
 
smoother
 
industry
 
transition
 
by
 
spreading
 
out
 
implementation.
  A  Canadian  study  utilized  a  discrete  choice  experiment  to  assess  consumer  
preferences
 
for
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling.
 
The
 
findings
 
indicated
 
that
 
consumers
 
place
 
high
 
importance
 
on
 
clear
 
allergen
 
labeling,
 
suggesting
 
that
 
earlier
 
implementation
 
could
 
enhance
 
consumer
 
safety.
 
However,
 
the
 
study
 
also
 
implies
 
that
 
a
 
balance
 
must
 
be
 
struck
 
to
 
avoid
 
imposing
 
undue
 
burdens
 
on
 
small
 
businesses.
  The  proposed  rule  is  a  positive  step  toward  enhanced  consumer  safety  and  industry  
transparency.
 
With
 
appropriate
 
accommodations,
 
such
 
as
 
hybrid
 
disclosure
 
methods,
 
staggered
 
compliance
 
timelines,
 
and
 
support
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.
 
The
 
regulatory
 
goals
 
can
 
be
 
met
 
effectively
 
and
 
efficiently.

Re:  
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket 
No. TTB-2025-0003) 
To Whom It May Concern: 
On behalf of AAFA, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, thank you for the 
opportunity to offer comments on proposed mandatory major food allergen labeling 
for wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages with alcohol content.  AAFA is the leading 
patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma 
and allergy patient group in the world.  We are dedicated to improving the quality of 
life for people with allergic diseases and asthma through education, advocacy and 
research.   
AAFA strongly supports the proposal to mandate major allergen labeling on the 
alcoholic beverages under the Bureau’s jurisdiction.  Our position, and responses to 
some of the specific questions posed by the Bureau, are detailed below. 
The importance of mandatory major allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages 
Many consumers of alcoholic beverages have food allergies.  Over 10 percent of 
adults in the United States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have 
experienced at least one food-allergy-related emergency department visit.1  
Exposure to an allergen can trigger reactions ranging from mild symptoms like 
isolated hives to a more severe, multi-system reaction called anaphylaxis, which is 
potentially life-threatening.

and Severity of Food Allergies Among US Adults.  JAMA Open Network. 2019; 2: e185630

Concerns about allergens in alcoholic beverages are not theoretical.  Wines, distilled 
spirits and beers can contain undisclosed allergens, either used as processing agents 
or as ingredients.2  For example, wine may contain residue from egg albumen, casein 
(milk protein), chitin (fiber from crustacean shells), fish oil, gelatin (protein from 
boiling animal parts) and isinglass (gelatin from fish bladder membranes).
3 
Consuming these particles in wine can trigger reactions for people allergic to these 
foods.4  Craft beers and liqueurs can also contain allergenic ingredients.   
To prevent a reaction, people with allergies must avoid foods and beverages 
containing their allergen.  For over two decades, the Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) has required major allergen labeling for 
FDA-regulated foods and beverages, making it far easier for people navigating food 
allergies to stay healthy.  FALCPA applies to the “top nine” allergens – milk, egg, fish, 
crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.   
Alcoholic beverages do not fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction.  However, when FALCPA 
was enacted, a House committee report noted that the committee expected the Tax 
and Trade Bureau to develop allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages.
5  As the 
preamble details, TTB has taken a long route to reaching the current proposal, and 
we strongly support its finally being enacted.  Mandatory labeling is crucial to provide 
consistent, reliable information to consumers.

Committee expects, consistent with the November 30, 1987 Memorandum of Understanding, that 
the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the Department of Treasury will pursuant 
to the Federal Alcohol Administration Act determine how, as appropriate, to apply allergen labeling 
of beverage alcohol products and the labeling requirements for those products. The Committee 
expects that the TTB and the FDA will work together in promulgation of allergen regulations, with 
respect to those products.”

While not directly addressed by this proposed rule, AAFA also strongly supports the 
mandatory inclusion of an ingredient list for alcoholic beverages.  Many people have 
allergies to foods that are not in the “top nine,” and need to know when their allergens 
are present in a food or drink.  In addition, this basic requirement would simply bring 
alcoholic beverages in line with what consumers are entitled to know about the 
ingredients of their FDA-regulated foods.  Similarly, to ensure the health and nutrition 
of all consumers, AAFA believes information on nutrition and serving sizes should be 
required on labels.  This would allow consumers to assess both their intake of alcohol, 
to stay within recommended safety guidelines,6 and their overall consumption of 
calories from alcoholic beverages,7,8 helping address obesity and related disease.  
 
Wording and Placement of the Labeling Statement 
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, in our 2024 comments AAFA 
encouraged TTB to hew as closely as possible to allergen labeling on FDA-regulated 
foods.9  Consumers with food allergies are familiar with FDA labeling, and would be 
able to most easily transition to a model that looks similar. 
We understand that this proposed rule does not address full ingredient listing 
requirements, and that the presence or absence of such a requirement could 
influence the allergen labeling.  Therefore: 
- If there is no full ingredient labeling requirement, AAFA supports TTB’s proposal 
to require “Contains Major Food Allergens:” followed by the relevant food

sources.  We agree that using the modifier “Major” can help reduce confusion 
regarding whether other, non-“top” allergens are addressed.  We do not 
support the inclusion of allergens in a voluntary ingredients statement 
because this would create inconsistency across products for consumers.  
Other ingredients (such as sulfites) should be listed in a statement that is 
separate from the “Contains Major Allergens” statement. 
 
- In the context of full ingredients listing, we would support TTB echoing the FDA’s 
requirements for major allergen labeling (permitting inclusion of allergens in 
the ingredients list or in a Contains statement). 
 
In either scenario, AAFA encourages TTB to require that all disclosures appear in one 
place on the label, with standard placement, type, size and presentation 
requirements to ensure consumer ease.  We note that a 2022 meta-analysis of 
studies that assessed health warning labels on alcohol bottles found that placement 
of the label, as well as size, were associated with attention paid to them by 
consumers.10  While allergen labels are somewhat different from other alcohol 
warnings because consumers with allergens will likely specifically seek them out, TTB 
should still consider minimum size requirements and consistent placement to ensure 
that this information is easy for consumers to find and read. 
AAFA strongly urges TTB to ensure that, as for FDA-regulated foods, major allergen 
information is included on the label itself, and not provided separately via QR code or 
any other electronic link.  On-package labeling is the standard for FDA-regulated 
products and ensures that all consumers, regardless of technology access or skills, 
can understand the information and make decisions to protect their health. 
Compliance Date 
AAFA encourages TTB to establish a compliance date of 3.5 years or less from the 
date of publication of a final rule.  This policy has been under discussion for decades, 
and producers of alcoholic beverages should be able to accomplish this on that

timeframe.  TTB should work to assist any small producers who present with questions 
or need technical support to comply. 
Conclusion  
AAFA strongly supports common-sense regulation to mandate major allergen 
labeling for wine, distilled spirits and malt beverages, to align with FDA’s requirements 
and consistently protect consumer health.  If you would like any further information 
on food allergies or the consumer perspective on labeling, please do not hesitate to

RATIONALE IN SUPPORT OF REJECTING THE RULE: 1. Under the voluntary disclosure system, there is a lack of cited scientific evidence of allergic reactions caused by undeclared allergens in wines, spirits, or malt beverages. A claim of regulatory necessity requires a good-faith effort to compile supportive scientific data (APA §706(2)(A)). Further, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published that finings are unlikely to pose an allergen risk because they are removed through production methods. 2. Voluntary compliance is justified due to a) rare usage, b) rare reactions, c) the prevalence of alternative cues, d) awareness and heightened self-protective behaviors of at-risk persons. The history of TTB Ruling 2006-1 supports the argument that reasonable nondisclosure results from non-use, adequate removal of residues, and alternative information sources, and not neglect. Inconsistent labelling is the result of variability in production methods and scientifically assessed risk. 3. Listing allergens that are not present creates signal noise that consumers have trouble processing accurately, resulting in loss of brand trust and label fatigue. The proposed rule would cause unnecessary heightened aversion to the affected products out of proportion to any assessed risk. This can have a spillover effect on the broader consumer base, as was seen with ""gluten-free,"" with potential loss of sales and tax revenue. 4. Most products with residual allergens are marketed with those allergens as crucial product qualities because they contribute to the taste, color, or mouthfeel. Most situations where fining processes result in reactive levels of allergen are, in fact, bartender refinements and mixed drinks. To promote a top-down regulation on mass producers without addressing establishments, such as through updated allergen training and awareness, further undermines arguments of regulatory necessity on this topic.

This rule has no negatives for the alcohol companies, but many positive for American citizens, and the health care industry. <br/>",0,-1,"[-1, -1, -1]",-1,-1,-1,approval,0.4781344532966614,"{'admiration': 0.004969147499650717, 'amusement': 0.00026774307480081916, 'anger': 0.0008307597017847002, 'annoyance': 0.007819307036697865, 'approval': 0.4781344532966614, 'caring': 0.03685687482357025, 'confusion': 0.0012693300377577543, 'curiosity': 0.0005058042006567121, 'desire': 0.0033830779138952494, 'disappointment': 0.011146742850542068, 'disapproval': 0.014286741614341736, 'disgust': 0.0014122376451268792, 'embarrassment': 0.0007135557243600488, 'excitement': 0.0004387902736198157, 'fear': 0.003279050812125206, 'gratitude': 0.0003461602609604597, 'grief': 0.0009093597764149308, 'joy': 0.0007621669210493565, 'love': 0.0014426104025915265, 'nervousness': 0.0026641718577593565, 'optimism': 0.028343329206109047, 'pride': 0.001067482866346836, 'realization': 0.05217484384775162, 'relief': 0.004233968444168568, 'remorse': 0.0012869082856923342, 'sadness': 0.01129522081464529, 'surprise': 0.00022215241915546358, 'neutral': 0.32993805408477783}"

Here's why: Impact on Small Wineries: Ingredient Disclosure Complexity – While wineries don't typically use major allergens as ingredients, some allergens—like egg whites (for fining), milk-based casein (for clarification), or wheat-based fining agents—may be part of the winemaking process. It is not always apparent whether trace amounts of allergens remain in the final product, so small wineries may need additional testing and record-keeping. Compliance Burden – Small wineries may have limited resources to conduct allergen testing, verify ingredient sources, and update labeling. Unlike large-scale producers with dedicated compliance teams, small wineries may face higher relative costs in ensuring adherence to new labeling requirements. Supplier and Process Transparency – Many small wineries rely on third-party suppliers for certain additives (like fining agents). If these contain allergens, wineries will need to obtain and verify detailed ingredient documentation, which may not always be straightforward. Potential for Consumer Confusion – If wineries are required to disclose allergens even when they are only used in processing (but not necessarily present in the final product), consumers might misinterpret the labels, leading to unwarranted concerns about allergens in wine. Regulatory Uncertainty & Legal Risk – If there is ambiguity about when an allergen must be disclosed (e.g., residual amounts after filtering), small wineries may face legal risks due to inconsistent interpretations of compliance. Conclusion: This proposed rule could disproportionately impact small wineries due to additional testing, documentation, and labeling costs. The biggest challenge is whether wineries can always determine with certainty if allergens used in processing leave any trace in the final product. If the rule does not clearly define this, small wineries may face compliance challenges and increased operational costs.

Requiring the consumer to use technology such as a QR code creates accessibility barriers on various layers and may lead to undue risk.

With
 
this
 
rising
 
trend
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
wise
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
proactive
 
regulation
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
reactionary
 
regulation.
 
  According  to  the  National  Survey  on  Drug  Use  and  Health  of  2023,  there  were  224.3  million  
people
 
ages
 
12
 
and
 
older
 
or
 
79.1%
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
had
 
drunk
 
alcohol
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
in
 
their
 
life.
 
A
 
rough
 
calculation
 
would
 
determine
 
that
 
approximately
 
13.7
 
million
 
people
 
have
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
consume
 
or
 
have
 
consumed
 
alcohol.
 
With
 
such
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
population
 
consuming
 
alcohol,
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
presents
 
a
 
health
 
risk
 
to
 
some
 
individuals.
 
Most
 
other
 
processed
 
products
 
and
 
products
 
that
 
contain
 
added
 
ingredients
 
require
 
there
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
allergen
 
label.
 
Though
 
the
 
products
 
that
 
fall
 
under
 
these
 
regulations
 
are
 
guided
 
by
 
the
 
FDA
 
while
 
alcohol
 
is
 
not.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
detriment
 
to
 
consumers
 
as
 
most
 
Americans
 
would
 
infer
 
that
 
since
 
the
 
Food
 
Allergen
 
Labeling
 
and
 
Consumer
 
Protection
 
(FALCPA)
 
Act
 
of
 
2004
 
and
 
Food
 
Allergy
 
Safety,
 
Treatment,
 
Education
 
and
 
Research
 
(FASTER)
 
Act
 
of
 
2021
 
that
 
alcohol
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
covered.
 
It
 
would
 
inherently
 
be
 
sensible
 
for
 
commonly
 
consumed
 
products
 
to
 
also
 
have
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling.
 
  Another  concern  for  not  labeling  major  allergens  besides  the  health  ramifications  of  some  groups  
is
 
the
 
moral
 
and
 
religious
 
aspect
 
to
 
it.
 
There
 
are
 
certain
 
religious
 
groups
 
that
 
consume
 
alcohol,
 
but
 
maintain
 
dietary
 
restrictions
 
for
 
some
 
food
 
items.
 
In
 
Catholicism
 
and
 
Eastern
 
Orthodoxy
 
some
 
fasting
 
periods
 
can
 
restrict
 
meat,
 
dairy,
 
and
 
fish.
 
In
 
Judaism,
 
the
 
Kosher
 
laws
 
prohibit
 
foods
 
such
 
as
 
pork
 
and
 
shellfish,
 
meat
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
consumed
 
if
 
kosher-slaughtered,
 
and
 
forbid
 
meat
 
and
 
dairy
 
from
 
mixing
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
meal.
 
Additionally
 
some
 
grains
 
are
 
restricted
 
during
 
passover.
 
Without
 
clear
 
labeling
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages,
 
it
 
may
 
make
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
adhere
 
to
 
their
 
faith
 
and
 
could
 
inadvertently
 
consume
 
ingredients
 
that
 
conflict
 
with
 
their
 
religious
 
beliefs.
  That  being  said,  there  are  people  who  avoid  certain  foods  due  to  general  moral  concerns  such  as  
milk,
 
eggs,
 
and
 
other
 
animal-derived
 
ingredients.
 
These
 
concerns
 
could
 
rise
 
from
 
industry
 
standards
 
or
 
practices
 
that
 
make
 
people
 
more
 
concise
 
of
 
what
 
they
 
consume.
 
The
 
addition
 
of
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
allows
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
choose
 
thoroughly
 
what
 
they
 
put
 
into
 
their
 
own
 
bodies.
 
Providing
 
clear
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
could
 
assist
 
people
 
in
 
choosing
 
what
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
personal
 
values
 
and
 
dietary
 
restrictions.
 
  Implementing  allergen  labeling  on  certain  alcoholic  beverages  is  a  matter  of  public  health,  the  
rights
 
of
 
a
 
consumer,
 
and
 
can
 
assist
 
ethical
 
considerations.
 
Without
 
clear
 
transparency
 
in
 
labeling
 
individuals
 
with
 
allergies
 
could
 
be
 
at
 
risk
 
and
 
consumers
 
could
 
mistakenly
 
by
 
breaking
 
ethical
 
or
 
religious
 
observances.
 
Especially
 
with
 
the
 
rise
 
of
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
the
 
dangers
 
that
 
come
 
with
 
them,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
alcohol
 
to
 
have
 
similar
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
as
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
drinks.

I agree with this proposition and advocate for its approval as keeping the labeling legislation for alcoholic beverages poses severe risks to consumers with those major allergies. Most advocates on this matter believe the FDA and its allergen and nutritional label guidelines are sufficient regulations to be placed upon the wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The opposition to this issue is very little as to oppose such a motion may paint that party in a negative light and make them an indisputable opponent to public health in the United States. I will lay out my argument for the approval of this regulation and for it to follow FDA standards of transparency for the products affected.

Firstly, I would like to explain and expose the issues with the current labeling system imposed by the TTB and its inadequacy. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms current policy of product transparency focuses on warning consumers of general safety and possible harm from the product. While important, they neglect to inform people of what is inside these products (Quinn). These safety warnings can be acceptable for some of the items this bureau is responsible for, such as firearms, but it is woefully inadequate for consumed products like alcohol. This is especially apparent when other products that are ingested like food, soft drinks, etc. are controlled by a completely different entity with the FDA and under that department face much stricter regulatory guidelines as products that are meant for ingestion, if left unregulated, pose a much greater risk to all members of society. When compared to firearms for example, which not all people interact with nor have to as opposed to drink products which are universally consumed. While I am not advocating for the transition of responsibility of wine, distilled spirts, and malt beverages to move from the TTB to the FDA, I still believe a lot can be achieved by imposing similar labeling system for similar products under their respective jurisdiction, like the case with alcohol.

There are millions of adults in the U.S. with food allergies, and they are at risk of coming into contact with their allergens inside alcohol. “Over 10 percent of adults in the Unites States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have experienced at least one foo-related emergency department visit” (Mendez). The nine major food allergens are Milk, Sesame, Soybeans, wheat, Peanuts, Tree nuts, Crustations, Shellfish, Fish and Eggs (Program). While some of these ingredients seem impracticable in a beverage with alcohol, many of these food products find their way into drinks like casein, chitin, fish oil, gelatin, etc. (Mendez). Even more allergens are added in the middle of production to add qualities and are removed later on but can still leave trace amounts (Quinn). Even with these possible exposures, there are very few cases of reactions to alcoholic beverages, but this number many be affected by underreporting as only the FDA has the proper reaction reporting system in place (Quinn) Still, many of these adults are in fear as many products have been proven to contain allergen particles, but the industry as a whole has refused to disclose this possibly life-saving information.

Despite the necessity, there is some possible pushback from the industry as they are concerned about loss of profit. For the producers, entering into a mandatory allergen disclosure, similar to the FDA’s, would mean facilities would have to be inspected and factories would be responsible for controlling the handling of allergen material (Program). They would also have to remake transparent packaging and possibly incur loss of consumers once they become aware of the possible allergens in the product (Quinn). However, it should be argued that regulations like this should already have been implemented upon the production of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages as a consumable product. Just because it is controlled by another agency does not mean it can have special exceptions to general safety procedures to protect the people and public health as a whole. I believe any outward opposition, regardless of the reasoning or possible personal loss, should be viewed as an opponent to public health of all United States adults and their point be disregarded. It could even be argued that an increase of transparency between consumer and producer would increase sales as those with allergens who have been skeptical in the past could be assured safety in consumption of the product.

In conclusion, the safety and wellbeing of all adult Americans who drink alcohol will be affected whether the vote is affirmative or not. I have come here to voice my opinion that the TTB should move forward with a mandatory allergen labeling system and that it would be beneficial to consumers for it to resemble that of the FDAs. This would allow for an easy transition in systems and consistent transparency across the U.S. food and beverage industries.

major
 
food
 
allergens
 
that
 
are
 
present
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.
 
Consumers
 
have
 
a
 
right
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
is
 
in
 
their
 
drinks;
 
therefore,
 
I
 
am
 
very
 
optimistic
 
about
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
Having
 
clear
 
and
 
concise
 
labels
 
that
 
involve
 
popular
 
allergies,
 
like
 
dairy
 
and
 
peanuts,
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
significantly
 
positive
 
impact
 
on
 
consumers.
 
Although
 
I
 
completely
 
agree
 
with
 
this
 
proposal,
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
add
 
additional
 
comments
 
and
 
opinions.
 
   An  article,  by  the  “Center  For  Science  In  The  Public  Interest,”  mentioned  how  11%  of  
adults
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
live
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
to
 
over
 
170
 
different
 
food
 
products
 
(2024).
 
Although
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
huge
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
population,
 
it
 
still
 
affects
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
Americans
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
handled
 
lightly.
 
Alcoholic
 
beverages
 
should
 
have
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
guidelines
 
for
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
that
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
beverage
 
companies
 
do.
 
Not
 
only
 
is
 
this
 
making
 
it
 
fair
 
for
 
the
 
consumers
 
who
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
careful
 
with
 
what
 
foods
 
they
 
consume,
 
it
 
will
 
also
 
benefit
 
curious
 
individuals
 
who
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
more
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
putting
 
into
 
their
 
bodies.
 
Considering
 
many
 
wines
 
and
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
well
 
detailed
 
list
 
of
 
every
 
single
 
ingredient
 
listed,
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
individuals
 
who
 
do
 
not
 
get
 
to
 
enjoy
 
these
 
beverages
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
unknown
 
of
 
what
 
it
 
contains.
 
While
 
some
 
drinks
 
clearly
 
contain
 
allergens,
 
others
 
use
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
process
 
which
 
can
 
inhibit
 
consumers
 
from
 
realizing
 
these
 
ingredients
 
are
 
present
 
(Food
 
Labeling,
 
2024).
 
In
 
an
 
article
 
about
 
food
 
labeling,
 
it
 
explains
 
how
 
cross-contact
 
of
 
certain
 
ingredients
 
are
 
unavoidable
 
(2024).
 
With
 
this
 
being
 
said,
 
requiring
 
a
 
label
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
potential
 
allergens
 
would
 
provide
 
much
 
needed
 
transparency
 
and
 
safer
 
consumption
 
for
 
consumers.
 
  In  my  opinion,  there  are  a  lot  of  details  that  need  to  be  revised  before  the  proceeding  of  
this
 
rule.
 
One
 
concern
 
is
 
whether
 
the
 
rule
 
will
 
require
 
labeling
 
for
 
allergens
 
that
 
are
 
barely
 
detected
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
products.
 
Could
 
there
 
still
 
be
 
a
 
potential
 
allergic
 
reaction
 
to
 
an
 
ingredient
 
that
 
has
 
very
 
low
 
levels
 
present?
 
There
 
should
 
be
 
clear
 
and
 
concise
 
guidelines
 
about
 
what
 
ingredients
 
to
 
disclose
 
on
 
the
 
label.
 
It
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
have
 
“may
 
contain”
 
ingredients
 
so
 
consumers
 
can
 
be
 
cautious
 
of
 
the
 
cross
 
contamination
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
present
 
during
 
the
 
production
 
process
 
(Cross-Contact,
 
2025).
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
in
 
allowing
 
enough
 
warning
 
to
 
buyers
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
list
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
added
 
ingredients
 
that
 
may
 
only
 
be
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
making
 
process
 
and
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Another  thing  I  would  like  to  address  is  the  compliance  period.  Although  there  is  a  five  
year
 
phase
 
in
 
period,
 
businesses
 
would
 
still
 
be
 
affected
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
extra
 
work
 
and
 
costs
 
that
 
go
 
into
 
this
 
new
 
rule.
 
According
 
to
 
an
 
article
 
about
 
government
 
affairs
 
updates,
 
the
 
TTB
 
struck
 
down
 
ideas
 
of
 
creating
 
a
 
separate
 
compliance
 
rule
 
for
 
smaller
 
producers
 
(Sorini,
 
2025).
 
However,
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
for
 
TTB
 
to
 
consider
 
funds
 
to
 
help
 
with
 
smaller
 
wineries
 
and
 
breweries
 
to
 
assist
 
the
 
transition
 
for
 
safer
 
and
 
more
 
in
 
depth
 
labeling.
 
Alcoholic
 
beverage
 
producers
 
would
 
also
 
have
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
their
 
products
 
to
 
be
 
thoroughly
 
tested
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
different
 possible  allergens.  The  strain  that  this  would  put  on  companies,  especially  smaller  businesses,  
could
 
be
 
detrimental
 
to
 
them
 
(Sorini,
 
2025).
  Another  concern  that  I  have  is  the  labeling  needs  to  be  clear  and  large  enough  for  
consumers
 
to
 
read
 
and
 
understand.
 
Not
 
only
 
will
 
this
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
buyers
 
to
 
quickly
 
identify
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
possible
 
allergens
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
present,
 
it
 
also
 
will
 
not
 
allow
 
for
 
any
 
confusion
 
or
 
possible
 
discrepancies.
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
step
 
for
 
making
 
all
 
food
 
and
 
beverages
 
transparent
 
in
 
the
 
ingredients
 
used
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
product.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
understand
 
why
 
consumer
 
safety
 
is
 
not
 
already
 
a
 
huge
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry.
 
If
 
all
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
drink
 
labeling
 
require
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
ingredients
 
present,
 
why
 
would
 
alcohol
 
not
 
fit
 
into
 
the
 
same
 
category?
  In  conclusion,  I  support  the  proposed  allergen  labeling  rule  because  it  will  help  protect  
people
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
provide
 
greater
 
transparency.
 
However,
 
I
 
urge
 
TTB
 
to
 
take
 
more
 
action
 
to
 
help
 
smaller
 
producers
 
during
 
this
 
transition.
 
I
 
would
 
also
 
like
 
for
 
the
 
consideration
 
of
 
“may
 
contain”
 
labels
 
and
 
ensuring
 
the
 
allergens
 
present
 
are
 
easy
 
to
 
read.
 
With
 
these
 
considerations
 
in
 
mind,
 
this
 
rule
 
can
 
be
 
both
 
practical
 
and
 
effective
 
for
 
helping
 
allergy
 
awareness
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.

This is for the safety of the public and for those choosing to engage in such activates. In 2006, food allergies in the nine categories were “estimated to affect about four million individuals in the United States” (Porter, 2006). Today, it could be more. The labeling of products is important to the public to ensure that everyone knows what they are ingesting. This could have a positive impact on business because those who are unsure whether a beverage contains any allergies, they may choose to avoid beverage out of caution. However, if labels are implemented onto either the packaging or onto the bottles/cans one could indulge as well creating more business.   A 2020 study showed that the way labels are implemented does have some impact. For instance, there was an 80% preference for bold facing the allergenic ingredients (Blom, 2020). This would immediately draw the eye to the components that would be most important clarifying and visually acknowledge ingredients that could be harmful. Additionally, 71% of the labels had a separate allergenic section (Blom, 2020). Once again, clarifying normal ingredients to ingredients that could be of harm. Having a section dedicated specifically to allergies could be more beneficial to someone who knows they have an allergy, as they would need to spend less time looking through the ingredients to determine if the beverage is safe for them to consume.   Further with labeling, the regulation mentioned the use of QR codes to easily display nutrients, allergies, and other information that may be of importance. There are some benefits to QR codes, especially for small business. “The most important advantage is that the QR Code can carry more information in a small space because they can be read vertically or horizontally” (Brabazon, 2014). With this, a smaller code that is big enough to be read by a cellphone can have a price benefit for business. Labels, and the production of them, can consume a lot of space and be costly of the manufacturer. Usually, when there is more of something, the price rises. By keeping a barcode small, but accessible, it would allow business consumers to apply these labels, inform consumers of the product, all while keeping the price at a reasonable cost. Some countries, such as the Australian winemaker, Jacob’s Creek (Brabazon, 2024) has already added QR codes onto the back of the bottles. This allows for the information that isn’t directly on the bottle to be placed in a separate location that is easily accessible to majority of the public.  I feel these changes to beverages such as wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages should be considered. The categories mentioned as major food allergies “are estimated to cause more than 90% of all food reactions” (Porter, 2006). Because of the amount of people that have potentially life-threatening allergies, they should be able to consume beverages without the worry of being in danger. I feel that it should be a right, just like with all other consumable for people to know what they are consuming. Therefore, the ingredients list should clearly specify the ingredients of the drink. I do believe that incorporating “Contains Major Food Allergens…” over “Contains:…” would be a good incorporation into specifying that not every allergen would be included but rather the major allergies. Today, there are a lot of different allergies not including the nine major categories. Other allergies such as food dyes, have been a common allergy and should also be incorporated into the labeling process. Recent discoveries have made the FDA aware about the dangers of red food dye. Beforehand, however, this dye was used in many foods and drinks, but since then has stopped. Likewise, a study found that a yellow-brown dye was used in some foods and in color liqueurs. The reaction from ingesting the dye caused anaphylactic reactions but also “chronic urticaria,” or also known as welts. The proportion of people with hypersensitive reactions was very small only affecting “.01-0.23% of the population but 2-7% of people with atopic backgrounds” (Treduler, 2022). Although the proportion is small, it is still a danger and people have the right to know for their own safety what is in the drinks. Safety, both for individuals and for a company should be a priority.   I believe that adding these changes, in a consistent and in a timely manner, do make a difference. Ease of access is a priority for a lot of people, and knowing the ingredients of food and beverages is a source of comfort for a lot of people as well. I think with additions such as labeling can make a difference in the consumer rate of some of these products. As a result, increasing business, and reaching new consumers that this business may not have reached before, but also providing those with allergies comfort and inclusion to activities they may have not had before.   Thank you for your consideration.  Citations  Blom, W.

2 of 3Comments from P. R. China on United States Notification
G/TBT/N/USA/2183
The draft regulation stipulated that distilled liquor products with ""no protein residue
after complete distillation"" may be exempted from the requirement of labeling major
food allergen statements. However, TTB will evaluate compliance by using
scientifically effective analytical methods to verify the absence of proteins in the
distilled components, which can reliably detect the presence of proteins or protein
fragments in the finished product. According to the transparency principle of
WTO/TBT, it is recommended to clarify the testing methods and verification
procedures of regulatory agencies.
Comments in Chinese are as below:
法规提案规定 “完全蒸馏后无蛋白质残留” 的蒸馏酒产品可豁免标注主要食
物过敏原声明标签要求， 但 TTB 将通过使用科学有效的分析方法验证蒸馏成分中
不存在蛋白质来评估合规性， 这些方法可以可靠地检测成品中是否存在蛋白质或

I’m writing as the owner of Three Sisters Winery, aka, Chestatee Valley Vintners to
share my concerns about TTB’s proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and No. 238, which
would require new “Alcohol Facts” labels on wine bottles.
While I support educating consumers, this rule would create serious financial challenges
for small wineries in Georgia. Redesigning labels and testing for nutritional content is
costly and time-consuming—especially for small producers like us.
There are better ways to promote health awareness without hurting local businesses.
Public campaigns or online education tools could inform consumers without forcing
costly label changes.
Please consider the impact of this rule on Georgia’s wine industry and the small
businesses that support our state’s economy and agriculture.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
Sharon V. Paul

I’m writing as the owner of Three Sisters Winery, aka, Chestatee Valley Vintners to share my concerns about TTB’s proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and No. 238, which would require new “Alcohol Facts” labels on wine bottles.



While I support educating consumers, this rule would create serious financial challenges for small wineries in Georgia. Redesigning labels and testing for nutritional content is costly and time-consuming—especially for small producers like us.



There are better ways to promote health awareness without hurting local businesses. Public campaigns or online education tools could inform consumers without forcing costly label changes.



Please consider the impact of this rule on Georgia’s wine industry and the small businesses that support our state’s economy and agriculture.



Thank you for your time and attention.



Sincerely,





Sharon V. Paul

For just about 20 years, there has been ongoing rulemaking about allergen labeling. There have 
been some changes but mostly small ones.  Today, I believe more and more people think this 
allergen labeling is important and that it is a good thing for the labeling rules to adjust to.
Over the past twenty years, studies have shown an increase in allergies.  Some attribute this to 
better testing and therefore identification.  But others believe we have more allergies because of 
the environment around us.  I also think that more and more Americans are finding that they 
react to allergens in different ways than before. Some just get a minor reaction but more are 
reacting more severely while others are getting more chronic allergies.  It’s good to revisit 
whether to make allergen labeling mandatory.
As a starting point, there has also been a proliferation of creators of alcoholic beverages. There 
are now thousands of makers of vodka and other speciality alcoholic beverages. Many are local 
makers and they are regulated locally for production.  However, I think that nationwide labeling 
is needed.
At this point, I believe it is important to have mandatory allergen labeling because there are so 
many brands and because so many people have allergies. I support the labeling on milk, eggs, 
fish, shellfish, tree, nuts, wheat, peanuts, soy beans, sesame. I also think that they should 
consider seeking comments on some of the various additive chemicals that might be present in 
alcohol beverages.
As a young person (I am 21 years old), I believe that allergen labeling should be mandatory and I 
support this rulemaking going forward. I am open to how exactly the beverages should be 
labeled (in terms of wording), but I think that more information is better.

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

As the proprietor of Georgia Winery, | am writing to express my concerns regarding the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and
Notice No. 238, which would mandate the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” statements on wine
labels. While | support initiatives that promote informed consumer choices, | am
apprehensive about the economic and operational challenges this requirement may impose
on Georgia’s wine indugtry, particularly for small and family-owned wineries.

Economic Impact on Georgia’s Wine Industry

Georgia’s wine industry significantly contributes to the state’s economy, supporting local
agriculture, creating jobs, and attracting tourism. The proposed labeling changes would
necessitate comprehensive label redesigns, leading to increased production costs. For
small wineries operating with limited budgets, these additional expenses could be financially
burdensome, potentially resulting in higher product prices for consumers and reduced
competitiveness in the market.

Is more regulation really needed to help support this growing industry or harm it? | ama
believer that allowing free market forces without tight regulation provides the best platform
for successful businesses and communities. Should the government instead focus on the
root cause of allergies or other chronic illnesses instead of regulating small businesses that
are under constant attacks? We, as producers, assume all the risks of the products we
produce and are therefore naturally incentivized to produce a non-harmful products. The
more red tape, hoops to jump through, and restrictions create less growth. Conversely,
shrinking government overreach allows consumers and producers to do business freely
allowing for a mutually beneficial relationship.

Operational Challenges

Implementing the “Alcohol Facts” labeling would require wineries to conduct detailed
analyses of their products to determine accurate nutritional content. This process involves
laboratory testing and compliance verification, demanding both time and financial
resources. Small wineries may find it particularly challenging to absorb these costs without
compromising other critical aspects of their operations.

Alternative Approaches for Consumer Education

While understanding the heaith implications of alcohol consumption is essential, there are
alternative methods to educate consumers without imposing stringent labeling
requirements. Public health campaigns and digital platforms can effectively disseminate
information about responsible drinking and health risks associated with alcohol. These
approaches can reach a broad audience without adversely affecting the economic stability
of local wineries.
A blanket statement regarding the number of alcoholic drinks recommended per person is
flawed as everybody is different. Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it
does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks
consumed.

Conclusion

| urge you to consider the potential economic and operational impacts of the proposed
labeling requirements on Georgia’s wine industry. By exploring alternative strategies for
consumer education, we can achieve the goal of informed decision-making without placing
undue burdens on small businesses that are vital to our state’s economy and cultural
heritage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. | am committed to promoting responsible
consumption and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that educate
consumers while supporting the sustainability of the wine industry.

I have read the rule and questions proposed by TTB for comment and I have a few recommendations that could potentially improve the rule. First, I do not believe that using an alternative method such as a website or QR code would be adequate to provide the same information to the consumer. These methods would likely cost the industry the same amount as a website as it would still require an adjustment to the label of the product. Additionally, it may be harder for consumers to access this information if they do not have compatible technology. The industry may lose business as this would be more time consuming for consumers and they will likely be less inclined to purchase the product all together. Therefore, major food allergen disclosures should be on the actual labels of the alcohol products in a position that makes it easy to read. Second, while the 5-year proposed compliance date will likely reduce the cost to small businesses, however, if possible, I would recommend an incentive be imposed for businesses that comply prior to the proposed compliance date. This could help offset the cost of testing for allergen proteins and changing labeling, which would reduce the burden on the industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected. It is currently difficult to find allergen information for many of the major alcoholic beverage companies via their websites and company representatives, and even more difficult to locate this information for smaller companies and brands. The sooner the industry starts making these changes, the more likely consumers will feel comfortable purchasing products since they will confidently know whether or not it is safe for them to consume. Finally, it is important for the rule to state that there shall be no amount of an allergen protein in the beverage in order for a company not to list that allergen on their label. Any trace amount of allergen protein can be detrimental for a consumer with an allergy. According to FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education), 33 million Americans have food allergies and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction. TTB should require companies that claim to have distilled their beverage so that there is no allergen protein to submit these test results to TTB to ensure compliance. While this may impose a slight burden, it will also save companies from potential lawsuits that may arise from people suffering life threatening reactions to products without allergens listed.

modifications
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
rule’s
 
effectiveness
 
while
 
reducing
 
unnecessary
 
burden
 
on
 
industry.
 
The  proposed  rule  addresses  an  important  public  health  concern.  According  to  the  Centers  for  
Disease
 
Control
 
and
 
Prevention,
 
food
 
allergies
 
affect
 
approximately
 
6.2%
 
of
 
adults
 
in
 
America
 
(

For
 
these
 
people,
 
exposure
 
to
 
allergens
 
can
 
cause
 
severe
 
reactions
 
including
 
anaphylaxis,
 
a
 
potentially
 
life-threatening
 
condition
 
requiring
 
immediate
 
medical
 
attention.
 
The
 
lack
 
of
 
consistent
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
creates
 
many
 
avoidable
 
health
 
risks
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
could
 
possibly
 
be
 
allergic
 
to
 
the
 
product.
 
 
The  current  legal  framework  leaves  a  scary  gap  in  consumer  protection.  The  Food  Allergen  
Labeling
 
and
 
Consumer
 
Protection
 
Act
 
requires
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
for
 
most
 
packaged
 
foods,
 
but
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
that
 
are
 
regulated
 
by
 
TTB
 
have
 
been
 
free
 
from
 
these
 
requirements.
 
Being
 
free
 
from
 
these
 
requirements
 
creates
 
confusion
 
and
 
risk
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
rely
 
on
 
constant
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
when
 
buying
 
the
 
product.

However,
 TTB  has  issued  a  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking,  Notice  No.  62,  71  FR  42329,  which  proposes  to  make  the  labeling  of  major  food  allergens  mandatory.  They  also  have  published  an  interim  rule,  T.D.  TTB-53,  71  FR  42260,  which  sets  forth  standards  for  optional  allergen  labeling  statements.  The  interim  rule  went  into  effect  on  July  26,  2006  (U.S.  Department  of  Treasury.

The  proposed  rule’s  approach  to  major  allergen  disclosure  lines  up  with  established  
international
 
standards.

I  support  the  inclusion  of  all  eight  major  allergens  and  including  sesame  in  the  labeling  
requirements.
 
However,
 
I
 
think
 
these
 
following
 
modifications
 
should
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
rule:
 
1.  Shortening  the  application  period  while  the  proposed  5  year  compliance  period  might  
ease
 
industry
 
burden,
 
making
 
the
 
consumer
 
exposure
 
to
 
unlabeled
 
allergen
 
risks
 
way
 
longer
 
than
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
be.
 
The
 
food
 
industry
 
successfully
 
put
 
into
 
place
 
FALCPA
 
requirements
 
within
 
2
 
years.
 
Given
 
that
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
alcohol
 
producers
 
already
 
maintain
 
allergen
 
control
 
programs
 
and
 
documentations,
 
a
 
3
 
year
 
application
 
period
 
would
 
probably
 
work
 
better
 
to
 
balance
 
the
 
industry
 
needs
 
with
 
consumer
 
safety.
 2.  The  rule  should  clearly  address  allergens  present  in  the  processing  aids  even  if  they  are  
not
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
products.
 
This
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
finding
 
possible
 
allergens
 
used
 
in
 
wine
 
production
 
such
 
as
 
milk,
 
fish,
 
and
 
egg.
 
Even
 
though
 
these
 
processing
 
aids
 
may
 
be
 
removed,
 
little
 
amounts
 
can
 
remain
 
and
 
trigger
 
reactions
 
in
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
highly
 
sensitive.
 3.  The  rule  should  make  clear  standards  for  voluntary  “may  contain”  statements  that  
contain
 
potential
 
cross
 
contamination
 
with
 
allergens
 
during
 
production.
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
manufacturers
 
communicate
 
possible
 
risks
 
while
 
protecting
 
themselves
 
from
 
liability.
 4.  TTB  should  consider  allowing  certain  allergens  information  to  be  provided  through  digital  
means
 
such
 
as
 
QR
 
codes
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
show
 
more
 
informational
 
package
 
declarations.
 
This
 
could
 
allow
 
manufacturers
 
to
 
give
 
more
 
information
 
than
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
put
 
on
 
the
 
packaging.
 
The  economic  impact  of  putting  these  requirements  into  place  is  justified  by  the  public  health  
benefits.
 
Industry
 
costs
 
mostly
 
involve
 
label
 
redesign
 
and
 
printing,
 
which
 
many
 
manufacturers
 
do
 
regularly
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
normal
 
business
 
operations.
 
These
 
costs
 
are
 
minimal
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
potential
 
medical
 
expenses
 
and
 
lost
 
productivity
 
associated
 
with
 
allergic
 
reactions
 
if
 
the
 
consumer
 
affected
 
chooses
 
to
 
take
 
action
 
against
 
the
 
business.
 
International  experience  shows  that  allergen  labeling  requirements  do  not  significantly  impact  
the
 
market
 
competition
 
or
 
consumer
 
choice.
 
They
 
help
 
producers
 
to
 
better
 
serve
 
health-conscious
 
consumers
 
and
 
possibly
 
expand
 
their
 
market
 
reach.
 
Many
 
craft
 
producers
 
have
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
adopted
 
allergen
 
labeling,
 
showing
 
both
 
its
 
attainability
 
and
 
market
 
value.
 
Finally,  while  supporting  the  fundamental  framework  of  the  proposed  rule,  I  urge  TTB  to  
strengthen
 
consumer
 
protections
 
by
 
taking
 
into
 
consideration
 
the
 
recommended
 
modifications
 
listed
 
above.
 
The
 
growing
 
widespread
 
presence
 
of
 
food
 
allergies,
 
combined
 
with
 
increased
 
consumer
 
demand
 
for
 
transparency,
 
makes
 
easy
 
to
 
understand
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
both
 
a
 
public
 
health
 
necessity
 
and
 
a
 
market
 
opportunity.
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
with
 
the
 
suggested
 
changes
 
would
 
establish
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
standard
 
that
 
protects
 
consumers
 
while
 
providing
 
the
 
industry
 
with
 
achievable
 
requirements.

Comments on Notice No. 238 - Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
To Whom It May Concern,  
We are writing on behalf of the ""Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C."" (CIVYL), 
the united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of 
spirits wines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, 
Casa Cuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and 
Pernod Ricard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and 
implementation of public policies related to alcoholic beverages. 
Firstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and 
contribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is 
dedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of 
alcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately 
inform consumers without causing confusion. 
In this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code 
of Federal Regulations under Notice No. 238, regarding the labeling of major food allergens for 
wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. 
While we recognize the importance of providing consumers with relevant information, including 
ingredients that may cause allergies, we believe that several aspects of this proposal could lead to 
unnecessary regulatory burdens. We consider that in addition to declaring the allergen, requiring an 
additional legend or statement on labels such as “CONTAINS MAJOR FOOD ALLERGEN” 
follow by a colon and the name of the food source, may not provide additional benefits to consumers 
while potentially increasing costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This may also 
not align with Article 2.2 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which states that 
technical regulations should not be developed, adopted, or applied with the effect of creating unnecessary 
obstacles to international trade to achieve the legitimate objectives of member states.  
In the other hand, the approach to allergen labeling in various regulatory frameworks emphasizes clarity 
and minimal disruption to trade, in the case of Mexico, NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that 
food allergens must be included in the ingredient list only when they are present in the final 
product, without requiring a specific warning and exclusively for liqueurs or creams, cocktails, 
and prepared beverages. 
Similarly, the Codex Alimentarius General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 
1-1985), was recently revised to recommend that major allergens be declared preferably within the 
ingredient list. If a separate declaration is required, it should be limited to a brief ""Contains ___"" follow 
by the name of the allergen, statement placed directly below or near the ingredient list. 
And in the case of the United States, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim 
rule, T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)) allows wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily declare allergens 
on labels using the term ""Contains,"" followed by the allergen name (e.g., ""Contains: egg"").  
As part of this, we understand the importance of declaring major food allergens to protect public health. 
It is suggested to consider two alternatives for their declaration. 
 
 
 
  
The first option is to consider presenting the name of the allergen as part of the ingredient list, 
which should only appear on the label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs, or creams, as 
well as any alcoholic beverages that, after distillation and/or before bottling, use optional 
ingredients and/or additives that may cause hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy and are present in 
the final product. 
The second option is to consider the declaration allergens immediately after the ingredient list 
using only the phrase ""Contains __."" This approach fulfills the legitimate objective of protect 
public health, provide clearer information for consumers and align with existing regulations. 
However, if it is decided to proceed to modify alcoholic beverage labeling to include allergen information, 
we strongly recommend allowing technological tools on the label to provide this additional 
information, such as electronic labeling (via QR code, digital platform, or website). 
This tool offers the following advantages: 
• Provides unlimited space for consumer information. 
• Gives consumers more information in a user-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Facilitates compliance with regulatory changes. 
• Help deliver information to one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent 
harmful and excessive alcohol consumption. 
• Allows the development of engaging, educational, and interactive content for consumers. 
 
By incorporating electronic labeling, necessary information can be provided to consumers 
without overcrowding the labels of alcoholic beverages, ensuring clarity and accessibility. 
For these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less 
burdensome solutions. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Panambí Garcés 
General Manager

Notice of proposed rulemaking: Major Food Allergen Labeling 
for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (“BNIC”) is a private institution financed by the Cognac 
professionals (producers and trade houses) and entrusted with public service missions. The objectives of 
BNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all 
Cognac stakeholders overall. 
 
On 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in 
the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring a labeling disclosure of all major food 
allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages, except for distilled spirits.   
 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exclusion for distilled spirits to label food allergens.  
 
In the case that the proposed exclusion for distilled spirits is not maintained and that distilled spirits come 
to be included in this proposed rulemaking:  
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This 
will largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized 
businesses.  
 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years.  
 
BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements

I started my winery in Massachusetts in 2020 and have been growing and producing quality aged wines for 5 years. I generally support the proposed regulation for listing major allergens on wine labels. However, there seems to be a major piece missing. I would like to bring to your attention the consequence of the proposed mandate implementation period of 5 years, and its impact in existing inventories. I've read this proposal three times and I have not read any scope on how this proposal will be applied to existing inventories. There is little or no mention of its applicability to existing inventories and library wines. As anyone knows, wines and wine inventories are typically aged over multiple years before release. My question is how will my existing COLA-approved and labeled inventories will be affected. My wine business depends on ageing our wines at various timeframes. We offer library wines that may be aged from 2 to 10 years, and beyond. These existing inventories have been labeled and are aging for an indefinite period in our cellar, and we offer these on occasion as vertical tasting products to our club members. Since our labels are permeant as required by TTB, it would be unfeasible to uncork and rebottle only to adhere to the proposed label changes. It would put our product at great risk of spoilage. We ask if the agency anticipated this impact and its unintended consequences, and to consider our proposed recommendation for resolution. Our Recommendation We are asking TTB add to the proposed regulation a clause that mentions that all existing inventories are retroactively exempt if they were bottled and labeled under the previous version (or the current existing version) of the regulation. This would allow industry members to avoid unnecessary cost and potential destruction of highly valuable library wines. Conclusion.

  De  Maison  Selections  Inc.  is  a  small  business  with  20  employees  that  imports  fine  wines,  ciders,  
and
 
spirits
 
from
 
small,
 
family-owned
 
wineries
 
in
 
France
 
and
 
Spain.
 
We
 
are
 
addressing
 
the
 
questions
 
the
 
TTB
 
raised
 
in
 
the
 
notice
 
of
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.
   
  Overall  Comment  on  Proposed  Rulemaking:  Complying  with  the  proposed  regulation  would  result  in  up-front  costs  in  both  time  and  money.  
While
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
adding
 
allergen
 
information
 
for
 
primary
 
ingredients
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
consumers,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
think
 
that
 
including
 
allergen
 
information
 
for
 
fining
 
agents
 
on
 
our
 
back
 
labels
 
would
 
enhance
 
consumer
 
health
 
and
 
safety.
 
Fining
 
agents
 
pose
 
a
 
very
 
low
 
risk
 
of
 reaction  (Peñas  et  al.,  2015;  Vassilopoulou  et  al.,  2011;  Wüthrich,  2018),  and  most  wine  intolerances  are  due  to  sulfite  sensitivity,  histamines  (not  from  fining  agents),  and  diamine  oxidase  deficiency  (Wüthrich,  2018).    Label  Wording:  The  back  label  of  wine  and  spirits  is  limited,  making  the  space  valuable.  Adding  more  
requirements
 
to
 
this
 
label
 
detracts
 
from
 
the
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
winery
 
and
 
pairings.
 
If
 
an
 
addition
 
is
 
necessary,
 
we
 
would
 
prefer
 
that
 
the
 
TTB
 
either
 
use
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
the
 
wording
 
""Contains:"".
 
We
 
favor
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
that
 
combines
 
the
 
mandatory
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
and
 
allergens.
 
  Allergen  Placement:   We  request  that  the  arrangement  of  the  warning  labels,  allergen  labels,  and  alcohol  facts  be  left  
to
 
the
 
discretion
 
of
 
the
 
manufacturer
 
and
 
importer.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
ask
 
that
 
no
 
specific
 
requirements
 
regarding
 
placement,
 
type
 
size,
 
or
 
presentation
 
be
 
mandated.
 
Furthermore,
 
we
 
request
 
that
 
fining
 
agents
 
be
 
excluded
 
from
 
this
 
regulation.
  Peñas  et  al.  (2015),  Vassilopoulou  et  al.  (2011),  and  Wüthrich  (2018)  found  that  any  remaining  
casein,
 
isinglass,
 
or
 
egg
 
from
 
the
 
fining
 
process
 
presents
 
a
 
very
 
low
 
risk
 
of
 
allergic
 
reactions.
 
Therefore,
 
fining
 
agents
 
should
 
be
 
exempt
 
from
 
the
 
allergen
 
listing.
 
However,
 
if
 
fining
 
agents
 
must
 
be
 
listed,
 
we
 
would
 
prefer
 
the
 
allergen
 
to
 
be
 
noted
 
with
 
'processing
 
aid'
 
in
 
parentheses.
  
  Implementation  Time:    We  prefer  coordination  with  the  proposed  regulation  implementing  Alcohol  Facts  Statements  for  
labeling
 
wines,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages.
 
We
 
also
 
request
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
label
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
permanent
 
allergy
 
label
 
for
 
easier
 
updates
 
per
 
vintage.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
prefer
 
a
 
5-year
 
compliance
 
timeline
 
that
 
coincides
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
implementation
 
timeline,
 
which
 
allows
 
our
 
producers
 
to
 
use
 
their
 
current
 
printed
 
back
 
labels.
 
  Ongoing  Costs:    Consumers  prefer  wine  labels  that  are  authentic,  unique,  and  have  personality  (Lunardo  &  
Guerinet,
 
2007);
 
however,
 
the
 
ongoing
 
regulations
 
requiring
 
warnings,
 
allergens,
 
and
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
label
 
diminish
 
the
 
information
 
that
 
consumers
 
value.
 
Therefore,
 
we
 
could
 
lose
 
sales
 
if
 
a
 
back
 
label
 
can
 
no
 
longer
 
convey
 
the
 
wine's
 
authenticity,
 
uniqueness,
 
and
 
personality.
 
  Small  Business  Impact:   As  a  small  business  importing  wine  and  distilled  spirits  from  family-owned  vineyards,  the  new  
proposed
 
requirements
 
will
 
increase
 
costs
 
for
 
our
 
business
 
and
 
foreign
 
producers.
 
The
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury
 
in
 
2022
 
found
 
that
 
some
 
laws
 
at
 
both
 
state
 
and
 
federal
 
levels
 
may
 
impose
 
a
 
disproportionate
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
and
 
medium-sized
 
producers
 
without
 
adequate
 
justifications.
 
We
 
concur
 
with
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury’s
 
findings
 
regarding
 
the
 
burdensome
 
nature
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
mandatory
 
labeling
 
measures
 
that
 
would
 
raise
 
entry
 
barriers
 
and
 
reduce
 
competition
 
in
 
an
 
already
 
highly
 
regulated
 
industry
 
(Department
 
of
 
Treasury,
 
2022).
 
We
 
contend
 
that
 
this
 
will
 
foster
 
further
 
exclusionary
 
practices
 
by
 
large
 
producers,
 
distributors,
 
and
 
retailers
 
who
 
are
 
better
 
positioned
 
to
 
absorb
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
these
 
proposed
 
labeling
 
requirements.
 
  Importer:    Data  Analyst:   Reporting  fining  material  is  requested  but  not  mandatory  for  our  information  collection.  
Therefore,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
gather
 
this
 
information
 
from
 
our
 
producers
 
and
 
enter
 
it
 
into
 
our
 
database,
 
which
 
would
 
take
 
about
 
5
 
to
 
10
 
hours
 
of
 
an
 
employee’s
 
time.
 
An
 
average
 
data
 
analyst
 
earns
 
$40
 per  hour  ( Salary ,  2025).  This  amounts  to  $200  to  $400  to  file  and  record  this  information.   Label  Making:   According  to  our  graphic  designer,  adding  a  QR  code  or  wording  to  each  label  would  take  20  
minutes.
 
Assuming
 
that
 
half
 
of
 
our
 
current
 
labels
 
require
 
allergy
 
labeling,
 
that
 
amounts
 
to
 
5,000
 minutes  or  83  hours.  An  average  graphic  designer  earns  $27  per  hour  ( Graphics  Designer  Salary ,  2025).  Adding  allergen  information  or  a  QR  code  to  our  labels  would  cost  $2,250.    Total  Cost:   The  total  cost  to  our  importing  business  for  adding  allergen  information  ranges  from  $2,450  to  
$2,650.
 
  Concluding  Statement:  We  understand  that  the  TTB  was  tasked  by  the  Department  of  Treasury  to  reexamine  its  
labeling
 
and
 
other
 
practices
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
and
 
public
 
health
 
while
 
reducing
 
or
 
eliminating
 
regulatory
 
requirements
 
that
 
generate
 
compliance
 
costs
 
and
 
serve
 
as
 
barriers
 
to
 new  entrants  or  burdens  to  small  businesses  (Department  of  Treasury,  2022).  However,  this  proposed  regulation,  which  includes  fining  agents,  increases  regulatory  requirements  that  create  
compliance
 
costs
 
and
 
heighten
 
barriers
 
for
 
new
 
entrants
 
while
 
imposing
 
burdens
 
on
 
small
 businesses.  The  TTB  proposed  these  new  regulations  in  good  faith,  but  the  spirit  of  EO  14036  
has
 
been
 
lost
 
in
 
this
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.

As an organization dedicated to protecting and advocating for individuals living with life-threatening food allergies, we recognize that transparency in ingredient labeling is a matter of public health and safety. The current lack of mandatory allergen disclosure in alcoholic beverages creates a dangerous information gap for millions of Americans with food allergies. This gap leaves them vulnerable to accidental allergen exposure that could result in severe or even fatal anaphylactic reactions. The inclusion of all major allergens,milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame—along with any ingredients containing protein derived from these sources, is essential. Alcoholic beverages are often consumed in social settings where individuals may not have immediate access to emergency medication, and where ingredient transparency is critical for making informed choices. We appreciate that TTB is considering a compliance date five years from the publication of the final rule, which allows manufacturers ample time to adapt. However, we encourage TTB to consider whether a shorter timeline could be safely implemented, particularly for high-risk allergens like peanuts and shellfish. Mandatory allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages would be a significant advancement in consumer protection, aligning these products with the standards already in place for food under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). It would also reflect a broader commitment to inclusivity, allowing those with food allergies to participate more safely in everyday experiences. We urge the TTB to move forward with finalizing and implementing this proposed rule. Lives depend on it.

The fact it has taken so long to require allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is quite alarming, especially while the market for alcoholic beverages and breweries has exploded. According to the Brewers Association, the number of breweries has grown six-fold over the past decade and a half [1]. However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption. To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories ""didn't count"" yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public. When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 74% of respondents said they were in support of adding ingredients to the labeling, 65% supported adding allergens, and 66% supported adding calorie content [4]. On top of this, the CSPI found that ""more than 75% of respondents"" preferred reading this information on the label rather than through an online resource. Despite the favoritism, the government has made the majority of labeling policies voluntary. The CSPI found that only ""17% of labels contained an ingredients list"" [5]. In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4. This fact highlights the ongoing problems with alcohol regulation in the nutritionary field. If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that ""it gives you wiiings"" to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.",m74-1rvb-bewe,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,United States,,Lawrence,Kelly,,,,,2025-02-13 05:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:41,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"I believe that the proposed rule will be of much benefit to the American consumer, primarily to the reinforcement of informed consent in the purchasing of products.

I believe that the proposed rule will be of much benefit to the American consumer, primarily to the reinforcement of informed consent in the purchasing of products. The fact it has taken so long to require allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is quite alarming, especially while the market for alcoholic beverages and breweries has exploded. According to the Brewers Association, the number of breweries has grown six-fold over the past decade and a half [1]. However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption.

To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories “didn’t count” yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public.

When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 74% of respondents said they were in support of adding ingredients to the labeling, 65% supported adding allergens, and 66% supported adding calorie content [4]. On top of this, the CSPI found that “more than 75% of respondents” preferred reading this information on the label rather than through an online resource. Despite the favoritism, the government has made the majority of labeling policies voluntary. The CSPI found that only “17% of labels contained an ingredients list” [5]. In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4. This fact highlights the ongoing problems with alcohol regulation in the nutritionary field. If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that “it gives you wiiings” to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.

Considering the address by the Treasury in 2022 that suggested the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau should undertake an initiative to revise the practices of labeling in regards to “protect[ing] consumers and public health”, it is appropriate to say that the support for this bill from all parties and stakeholders is present [8]. While the markets for alcoholic beverages have had distinct differences in terms of regulatory practices over the past century, lots of the market has remained unchecked. The Treasury report mentioned above highlighted the concern of the massive consolidation of the brewer market, citing that “two brewers… account for an estimated 65%” of the nation’s market for beer. Introducing labeling could potentially shift consumer preferences toward smaller brands that provide higher transparency over their beverages, potentially shrinking the faintly duopolistic beer market in present day.

Overall, it is evident that the introduction of allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is needed and supported, and there is a strong case to be made that nutritional labels overall should be added too. Though the alcoholic beverage market is complex, it still deserves to be treated like the rest of the foods you buy in a supermarket.

Proposed Rule Assignment

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

While I read through the proposed rule, I believe that food allergen labels for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages would help facilitate the buying of specific types of wine for consumers and would overall have a positive impact on commerce regarding these products. Creating a more transparent label for individuals with certain types of food allergies could help boost sales in specific types of wine, spirits, and malts as people with food allergies, such as the identified products in the proposed rule, would know to look at these kinds of beverages. Depending on the extent to which one may have an allergic reaction could be hard to pinpoint and, perhaps, vary from person to person, so having greater transparency on the bottle could relieve some stress for people with food allergies by not having to do things, such as research a bottle of wine or another beverage due to the fact there are undisclosed allergens used to make it. According to an article by Amy Greenberg of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, “over 10 percent of adults in the United States have food allergies, and 38 percent of these adults have experienced at least one food allergy related emergency department visit,” (Greenberg). This letter concerning the re-labeling and advertising of wines, spirits, and malts, also, mentions how the individual may react to a food allergen, as the response could range from shortness of breath, mild hives, or in extreme cases death. Another statistic worth noting comes from the National Library of Medicine and an article about allergic and intolerant reactions to wine. The data states that 10% of Americans are affected by hypersensitivity reactions to alcoholic beverages, one example given is red wine in particular (Wuthrich). The causes of the intolerant reactions ranged from fish gelatin to dairy products, which are some of the identified major food allergens the proposed rule discusses in its framework. This is an easily avoidable risk to prevent if the undisclosed allergens were to simply be placed on the bottle, and this is one reason the relabeling proposed rule would have my support. Another reason, I believe the proposed rule should have a fair amount of support is the fact that the framework of the rule does seem quite sound. For example, the rule’s says their definition of “major food allergen,” is consistent with that of the FD&C Act, the rule also goes on to list which specific products, for example milks, eggs, and fish, are fall under the statutory definition provided by the FD&C Act. This reason is, basically, an extension of my previous reason for supporting the proposed rule as with clear definitions consistent with other acts and statutes the process of labeling should be more streamlined, as companies would not have possible stress of ensuring their products may fall in one definition of major food allergens, but not in another. According to an article from the National Library of Medicine, 1 in every 20 Americans are burdened by cow’s milk allergy or CMA (Warren). So it is clear that ignoring having warnings or proper labeling disclosing the ingredient within a particular product could prove problematic and, perhaps, make the consumer more cautious of specific products from certain companies and potentially harm the market and have an overall negative impact on commerce. With this point, it can most definitely be argued to the extent of whether the impact on commerce would be substantial. Now, moving away from the labels themselves and the ingredients listed on them, I am also in support of the proposed rule because of the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations the rule is suggesting. The proposed rule suggests a five year compliance period and this is good for two reasons, which the act seems to make as main concerns. The first reason being for the five year compliance period is to limit the impact on small businesses, which the consideration of small business within the proposed rule may create further support for the proposed rule amongst people within small communities where local business may be more prominent. The second reason the framework provides is that the five year compliance period would prove to be less costly than, for example, a 2 year compliance period. The framework of the cost analysis of the act shows to those who are to view the proposed rule that the longer compliance is more beneficial for the public and government spending as a whole, as the two year period would demand about $161.7 million per year, whereas the five year period would demand about $40.2 million a year. Overall, I would say the proposed rule would be beneficial for reasons of safety and the overall cost it would need to come to fruition. The definitions and parallels with existing regulations and acts would make the proposed rule one that compliments other regulations nicely, and the positive affect would be seen in the market.

RE: Docket No.  TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for  Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages - Request for 120-Day Extension for Comments  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the 
nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of U.S. wine exports .  Distilled Spirits 
Council of the United States (“DISCUS”) is the principal trade association for the leading 
producers and importers of distilled spirits products sold in the  U.S. and represents 
distillers of all sizes .  The Beer Institute (“BI”) represents the $ 409.2 billion beer industry –  
an industry that includes over 6,600 brewers and more than 2.4 million American jobs.  BI is 
a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing both large and 
small brewers, as well as importers and industry suppliers.  The Brewers Association (“BA”) 
seeks to promote and protect the interests of craft brewers and the craft brewing 
community, including beer consumers and home brewers. Today the BA  has roughly 5,000 
full voting brewery members – including members in every state – as well as over 1,000 allied 
trade members and over 30,000 home brewer and beer enthusiast members.   The National 
Beer Wholesalers Association’s (“NBWA”) purpose is to provide leadership, which 
enhances the independent beer and beverage distribution industry; to advocate before 
government and the public; to encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol ; and to 
Page 2 of 4 
 
provide programs and services that will benefit its members.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of 
America (“WSWA”) is the only national membership organization of wine and spirits 
distributors.  On behalf of its more than 380 member companies, WSWA advocates on their 
behalf with regards to federal, state, regulatory, and legal issues impacting distributors and 
the beverage alcohol industry.   WineAmerica is the National Association of American 
Wineries, representing wineries, winery associations, and wine industry supply companies 
across the country.  WineAmerica’s mission is to encourage the dynamic growth and 
development of American wineries  and winegrowing through the advancement and 
advocacy of sound public policy.  The American Craft Spirits Association (“ACSA”) the only 
national registered non-profit trade association representing the U.S. craft spirits industry. 
Its mission is to elevate and advocate for the community of craft spirits producers, and 
membership in ACSA is open to anyone.  American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) is a 
trade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in 
the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and 
around the world.   
 
We refer to Wine Institute , DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA 
collectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   
 
The Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in Notice No. 
238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (“Notice  
238”).  The comment period for Notice 2 38 is scheduled to end on April 17, 20 25. The 
Associations request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would extend 
to August 15, 2025. 
 
As a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily 
regulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of 
the new administration.  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in 
the final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the 
first day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries 
they regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into 
place since Notice 238 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and 
midsize wineries , craft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great  costs and 
operational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even 
meaningfully participating in the comment process means  they must redirect time and 
resources. 
 
Notice 238 is expansive—i.e., 16 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10- point, single -spaced 
font—and poses at least 14 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It is 
also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that  it raises.  
Indeed, TTB acknowledges in Notice 238 that it had been almost 20  years since it last 
solicited comments on these issues .  Accordingly, it undertook two “virtual listening 
sessions” in February 2024, however, there was no proposed rule at that time and the notice 
issued just 28 days in advance of the sessions .  A ddressing these issues in response to a  
proposed rule, and nearly two decades since the last proposed rule, will necessarily require 
updated input.  That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of the proposed Page 3 of 4 
 
rule—including the many questions and requests for comments in Notice 238—and for our 
members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit the overall 
process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. 
 
It is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 23 8 will 
impact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance 
of the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey 
the input of all  our members to ensure their perspectives are  included and well-reflected.  
TTB acknowledges that the Codex Committee on Food Labelling has been discussing food 
allergen standards, allergen labeling provisions, and a possible framework for evaluating 
exemptions for food allergens .  Our members need time to review and consider that same 
work and related issues that evolved in the nearly two decades since TTB last addressed 
these issues with a proposed rule.   Moreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 23 8 on 
important but s weeping areas of interest such as comments on “ whether there are better 
alternatives” to what it proposes.  Our members will need additional time to consider other 
options available for those purposes  and then explain and discuss them  in submitted 
comments. 
 
Last, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that 
impact our members .  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing alcohol 
facts statements in the labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same 
day as Notice 238 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 238’s 
publication, the FDA published a rulemaking propos ing front-of-package labeling for 
nutrition which will also impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 
238, propose new rules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration .  We 
therefore believe a 120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. 
 
We would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request.

This requirement is essential for several reasons. Firstly, food allergies are a significant public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 32 million Americans suffer from food allergies. Currently, many consumers remain unaware that alcohol beverages often lack proper ingredient labeling, including allergen labeling requirements established by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). By requiring comprehensive ingredient disclosure, TTB would empower consumers to make safer choices, mitigating the risk of unforeseen reactions, including triggering allergic responses. Secondly, transparency in labeling aligns with modern consumer expectations and public health advocacy. In 2021, various consumer groups and public health advocates called for mandatory labeling, emphasizing that consumers should have full access to information about the content of the products they consume. The public has expressed dissatisfaction with the current voluntary labeling system, which upholds ambiguity. A standardized disclosure of all ingredients would be a significant step toward greater transparency and consumer protection. Furthermore, the TTB possesses the statutory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act to ensure that consumers receive ""adequate information"" about the identity and quality of alcohol products. The absence of mandatory ingredient labeling represents a gap in consumer protection that the TTB is well-positioned to address. Implementing such regulations would not only enhance consumer awareness but also foster trust in alcohol brands that prioritize transparency and safety. Lastly, the proposed regulations align with the TTB's mission to protect public health and well-being. By establishing uniform ingredient labeling requirements, the TTB would not only fulfill expectations set forth in previous public health initiatives but also adhere to the discussions and recommendations highlighted in the Treasury's Competition Report on alcohol markets. This report emphasizes that regulatory actions promoting public health should take precedence. Establishing a consistent framework for full ingredient disclosure would reflect a proactive response to these recommendations. In conclusion, mandating ingredient labeling on alcohol beverages is a vital initiative that would enhance consumer safety, ensure compliance with public health standards, and fulfill the TTB's regulatory responsibilities. Such requirements would provide Americans - particularly those vulnerable to food allergies, and/or sensitive to a diverse range of ingredients - with the necessary information to make informed choices about their consumption of alcohol beverages.

By establishing uniform ingredient labeling requirements, the TTB would not only fulfill expectations set forth in previous public health initiatives but also adhere to the discussions and recommendations highlighted in the Treasury's Competition Report on alcohol markets.

In conclusion, mandating ingredient labeling on alcohol beverages is a vital initiative that would enhance consumer safety, ensure compliance with public health standards, and fulfill the TTB's regulatory responsibilities.

This requirement is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, food allergies are a significant public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 32 million Americans suffer from food allergies. Currently, many consumers remain unaware that alcohol beverages often lack proper ingredient labeling, including allergen labeling requirements established by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). By requiring comprehensive ingredient disclosure, TTB would empower consumers to make safer choices, mitigating the risk of unforeseen reactions, including triggering allergic responses.

Secondly, transparency in labeling aligns with modern consumer expectations and public health advocacy. In 2021, various consumer groups and public health advocates called for mandatory labeling, emphasizing that consumers should have full access to information about the content of the products they consume. The public has expressed dissatisfaction with the current voluntary labeling system, which upholds ambiguity. A standardized disclosure of all ingredients would be a significant step toward greater transparency and consumer protection.

Furthermore, the TTB possesses the statutory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act to ensure that consumers receive ""adequate information"" about the identity and quality of alcohol products. The absence of mandatory ingredient labeling represents a gap in consumer protection that the TTB is well-positioned to address. Implementing such regulations would not only enhance consumer awareness but also foster trust in alcohol brands that prioritize transparency and safety.

Lastly, the proposed regulations align with the TTB's mission to protect public health and well-being.

The regulation I wish to provide commentary on is RIN 1513-AC94, Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages proposed by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) on 01/17/2025. This regulation proposes to require disclosure of all major food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages subject to TTB's regulatory authority, and under the proposed regulations, labels must declare milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as ingredients that contain protein derived from these foods, if used in the production of the alcohol beverage and unless one of three exceptions apply. TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. I strongly support this proposed regulation to adopt RIN 1513-AC94. As incoming medical professionals, one rationale behind our support is ensuring accessibility of allergen advisories and safety to everyone purchasing alcoholic beverages. 33 million Americans are living with food allergies, some of whom with allergies so severe they would experience a life-threatening emergency if not adequately informed. After this regulation was first introduced, the majority of comments during public hearings were universally supportive of RIN 1513-AC94. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, a patient advocacy organization, stated that ""To the extent possible, labeling information should be displayed on alcoholic beverages similar to labeling on FDA-regulated foods. Consumers with food allergies are accustomed to FDA labeling, and would be able to easily transition to a similar model for checking the safety of alcoholic beverages . . ."". Our support is further guided by input from professional organizations providing medical guidance related to allergen labelling. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology explains that, ""Teens and young adults may need to be reminded or taught anew that the Food Allergen Labeling Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) does not cover alcoholic beverages. Therefore, this is an unregulated area which may make determination of the ingredients of mixed alcoholic drinks difficult to ascertain. Additionally, they may encounter inconsistencies in how well educated restaurants and bar staff are about food allergy, anaphylaxis and cross-contact issues with food proteins."" We agree that these labels should be written clearly on food products, and should not be shared via QR code, as this may disadvantage individuals without smartphones or the internet, particularly affecting older adults, low-income individuals, and those in rural or tribal areas. I agree that any use of a major food allergen or its protein derivative in production would require disclosure, regardless of any threshold level. This proposed rule matters for public health because improved transparency regarding food and drink consumption is of utmost importance, enabling people to make informed decisions of what they ingest. Though there are costs associated with the labeling, the universal benefits greatly outweigh the cost.

Japan’s Comment on the “G/TBT/N/USA/2182” 
 
Japan appreciates that the United States of America provided WTO members the 
opportunity to comment on 27 CFR Part 4, 5, 7, 24, 25 and 27 by notifying the 
“G/TBT/N/USA/2182”.  
 
The proposed mandatory labeling of Alcohol Facts could impose a significant burden 
on small businesses such as liquor manufacturers and importers. In order to reduce 
the burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to prevent any 
problems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following requests: 
 
[Comment 1] 
Regarding nutrient labeling requirements, we would like nutrients to be listed only if 
mentioned nutrients are present at a certain level or higher. In the case of alcoholic 
beverages, most products do not contain, or contain only a de minimis amount of, 
fat and protein. We believe that it should not be mandatory to label substances that 
are not present or that are present only a small amount in a product. 
 
[Comment 2] 
TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule is 
published in the Federal Register. As it is necessary to ensure that businesses have 
sufficient time to prepare for making changes to labels of their products, we request 
that the proposed 5-year period be maintained, and not be shortened. 
 
[Comment 3] 
Given that label space is limited, in order to reduce  the burden on businesses we 
would like it to be possible to provide Alcohol Facts through electronic  means such 
as QR codes. By allowing the use of electronic means, we believe that businesses 
will find it easier to accommodate different languages and to update information, 
thereby reducing the burden of displaying Alcohol Facts. If this request is not granted, 
this will become a trade barrier. 
 
[Comment 4] 
Although the proposal does not make analytical testing mandatory, nevertheless we 
would like the TTB website to clearly state proper analytical testing methods for each 
nutrient for reference. When we examined TTB website, w e found we were unable 
to confirm the contents of the Official TTB method described in the TTB Procedures 
2020-1, and we were also unable to access the AOAC method for free. It would be  
 
2 
 
much appreciated if a document containing all of  the information necessary for 
analysis would be made publicly available free of charge, for reference. We also ask 
that the proposed tolerance of 20 percent, either above or below the stated amount 
of calorie, carbohydrate, protein and fat, not be altered. 
 
We would also like the U.S. to answer the following questions: 
 
[Question 1] 
Regarding the serving size, given that a serving size  for sake i s not explicitly 
mentioned in the proposal, do you anticipate that sake will use the reference amount 
for wine? 
 
[Question 2] 
The proposal allows b usinesses to rely on  published databases rather than on 
analytical testing. Would it be acceptable to quote and use databases published by 
any organization in any country? If you expect any specific published databases to

Re: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau - Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Bessent, 
On behalf of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a national health no-profit organization, I write 
today to call your attention to the negative health effects of alcohol and to ask you to inform consumers by 
moving forward with the proposed alcohol labeling rule. These labels will help fulfill the administration’s goals of 
preventing and reducing chronic disease. 
The “First Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health” was issued in 1971, but even by that time 
the health risks of consuming alcohol had already been well documented.1 As the evidence on alcohol’s health 
risks continues to mount, our organization recommends the current warning label on alcoholic beverages, which 
first appeared in 1989, be updated to better protect Americans by listing specific health risks, as well as nutrition 
and allergen information. 
The label, which has not been updated in more than 35 years, currently reads: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) 
According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the 
risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate 
machinery and may cause health problems.”2 
Using the vague term “health problems” leaves Americans unaware of the true toll alcohol consumption can have 
on health, including a growing understanding of how it raises the risk of several types of cancer. It is vital that this 
label be updated to reflect the increased evidence and understanding of the specific risks of alcohol consumption. 
In January 2025, the Surgeon General released “Alcohol and Cancer Risk,” an advisory report that cites scientific 
evidence on the link between alcohol consumption and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, 
including breast (in women), colorectum, esophagus, laryngeal, liver, mouth, and throat.3 The report recommends 
that the existing Surgeon General’s health warning label on alcohol-containing beverages be updated to include a 
warning about the risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption. Our organization, which has 17,000 doctor 
members, already recommends avoiding alcohol as part of our Let’s Beat Breast Cancer campaign, which 
provides healthcare providers and the public with evidence-based resources and powerful steps to reduce breast 
cancer risk.4 This campaign echoes the recently passed policies of the American Medical Association, which 
support not only clearer alcohol labelling but also efforts to educate the public about the benefits of lifestyle 
changes that may reduce breast cancer risk, including limiting alcohol intake, regular physical activity, 
maintenance of a healthy body weight, and a healthy plant-based diet.5 This policy also encourages physicians to 
regularly discuss with their individual patients the benefits of lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk.  In addition to adding a cancer warning, we recommend that the label also address other health risks to the liver, 
brain, gut, pancreas, lungs, cardiovascular system, immune system, and other parts of the body, as detailed by the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.6  
Ingredient information should also be included for those looking to avoid allergens—such as sulfites and grains 
like wheat, rye, or barley—or animal products that are sometimes used as flavoring or fining agents, which are 
used to filter out impurities and improve the clarity of some alcoholic beverages. 7 Common animal-based fining 
agents include milk byproducts including whey, casein, and lactose. Other ingredients commonly found in 
alcoholic beverages include eggs; isinglass, which is derived from fish bladders; and gelatin, which is derived 
from animal skin, bones, and cartilage.8 Consumers who wish to avoid consumption of these ingredients, whether 
for health or other reasons, should have access to this information. 
Updated warning labels on alcohol are long overdue and should reflect current knowledge about the health risks 
of alcohol, as well as allergen and ingredient information that will help Americans make well-informed decisions. 
Thank you for your attention to this important issue. 
 
Sincerely,

Comment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) 
VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION 
Dear Administrator Ryan:  
Consumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important 
rulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and 
MajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to 
strengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in 
grams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the 
format and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how 
this rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and 
to urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the 
basic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other 
beverages and food. 
Leading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol 
labeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates 
alcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers 
what’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with 
cheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, 
Calley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full 
transparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 
CFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol 
labeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the 
available evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have 
documented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that

4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but 
significant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  
Similarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard 
drinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate 
their alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that 
do not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more 
conscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of 
alcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related 
harms.7  
These spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to 
consumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for 
Surgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third 
biggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can 
increase the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public 
awareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate 
drinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating 
the health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage 
Labeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that 
worthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its 
pledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  
There is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see 
on the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism 
can end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.  
Sincerely,

Consumers should be provided with all the nutritional facts that are clear about what is entering their bodies. Currently, there are some ""Alcohol Facts"" provided on alcoholic beverage products, but these are limited. Informed decisions can be made by including more facts related to nutrition. Suppliers should think of consumers first, as that is who will supply this information to consumers.

Dear TTB,

As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 237. I urge the TTB to consider the broader implications of expanding definitions and permitted ingredients for distilled spirits. While regulatory modernization is important for industry innovation, public health protection must remain paramount.

Widening the standards of identity—particularly allowing for a broader range of flavorings, additives, and processing techniques—risks further obscuring the true content of alcohol products from consumers. Transparency and clarity are essential for consumers to make informed decisions about their health. If new ingredients or processes are allowed, there must be strict labeling and disclosure requirements to ensure that consumers are not misled or unknowingly exposed to compounds that could pose health risks.

Moreover, the normalization or rebranding of certain spirits under broader standards may appeal to younger or more vulnerable populations. The TTB should take into account the potential for increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including addiction, liver disease, and alcohol-related injuries.

Public health considerations should be integrated into any final rule. I respectfully recommend TTB:

* Require mandatory ingredient disclosure on labels for all spirits.
* Conduct or require pre-market safety reviews for novel additives.
* Assess the public health implications of marketing changes enabled by revised standards.

Thank you for considering my perspective.

Dear TTB,
As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 237. 
I urge the TTB to consider the broader implications of expanding definitions and 
permitted ingredients for distilled spirits. While regulatory modernization is important for 
industry innovation, public health protection must remain paramount.
Widening the standards of identity—particularly allowing for a broader range of 
flavorings, additives, and processing techniques—risks further obscuring the true 
content of alcohol products from consumers. Transparency and clarity are essential for 
consumers to make informed decisions about their health. If new ingredients or 
processes are allowed, there must be strict labeling and disclosure requirements to 
ensure that consumers are not misled or unknowingly exposed to compounds that could 
pose health risks.
Moreover, the normalization or rebranding of certain spirits under broader standards 
may appeal to younger or more vulnerable populations. The TTB should take into 
account the potential for increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including 
addiction, liver disease, and alcohol-related injuries.
Public health considerations should be integrated into any final rule. I respectfully 
recommend TTB:
•Require mandatory ingredient disclosure on labels for all spirits.
•Conduct or require pre-market safety reviews for novel additives.
•Assess the public health implications of marketing changes enabled by revised

This letter presents comments of the National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB)' on the Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
(TTB) Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed rules cited above. NFIB finds it
hard to understand why the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management
and Budget continue to pursue these Biden Administration proposals that would place
heavy and unwarranted burdens on the small businesses of America in the beer, wine,
and spirits industry. NFIB recommends and requests that the Treasury Department
withdraw both Biden proposals.

1. The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses
That Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust

Census Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that
small businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the
beer, wine, and spirits industry:

Line of Number of Firms That Had

Business Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage
Breweries 3,214 2,609 81%
Wineries 3,576 2,975 83%
Distilleries 760 659 86%

In the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and
Spirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than
6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.
The report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the
number of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has

grown dramatically but still occupies only a small share of the market.’ Thus, the
Government's own data makes clear that, when the Treasury Department aims new
labeling requirements at the beer, wine, and spirits industry, it hits primarily small
businesses.5 The two Biden-proposed rules fail to recognize the practicalities of
running small businesses and fail to make the adjustments for small businesses that the
congressional policy stated in the Regulatory Flexibility Act contemplates.®

Small businesses, unlike the corporate behemoths in the beer, wine, and spirits industry
whose names and fortunes most everyone knows, cannot afford the bevy of lawyers
and experts necessary to decipher the rules and physically implement them, let alone
afford the cost of changes in processing and machinery to accommodate them.
Regulatory compliance costs small business owners time and money, both of which are
generally in short supply as they strive to keep their small businesses going, meet their
customers’ needs, and create jobs. The Biden-proposed rules would impose
unaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive
barrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in
the industry who can.

The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
fail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared
that “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities
has in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,

Rule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at

§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,
sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,
differing views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,
moral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these
questions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and
spirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound
science and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.
NFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits
have available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage
environments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out
to Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-
alcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the
guidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at
https:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-

discouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress
also noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated
businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to
inefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some
cases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental
and economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules
simply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately
dismisses it.®

President Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the
country’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:

My Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built
on common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators
first. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade
practices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°

To help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting
red tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

2. TTB Did Not Get the President's Deregula’ Message

President Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they
should seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.

On January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days
after TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule
and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order
14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The
ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on
the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic
growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He
also said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private

8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB
considered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is
not proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of
the proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who
are allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a
permanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage
labels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such
products.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all
pseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to
combat.

® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).
expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic
prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”
He emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate
unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°

On February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring
Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government
Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should
identify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that
impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”
and “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private
enterprise and entrepreneurship.”*'

On April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-
Competitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not
predetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that
reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they
create for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed
agency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...
distortions on the operation of a free market.”!2

These are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though
improperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive
Suggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,
issued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.

To comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the
quoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-
proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the
Department of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to
the specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head
of TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that
unreasonably burden small and other businesses.

3. These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record

TTB says'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a
recommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in
the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits '4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a
February 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)'®
joined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or
together, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-
proposed rules.

Regarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes'® the Executive Summary at
the front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,
such as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been
implemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB
should revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory
information on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In
between the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the
report, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the
recommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by
commenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report
recommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the
recommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient
labeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was
therefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen

with the Competition Report's recommendations[.]’2°

The CSPI letter of February 24, 2021, represented the view of seven organizations that
exist to advocate particular views, in this case not favorable to the beer, wine, and
spirits industry: CSPI, Alcohol Justice, American Institute for Cancer Research,
Consumer Federation of America, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, National
Consumers League, and U.S. Aicohol Policy Alliance. Advocacy to the federal and
state governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by
the First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state
constitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a
complete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.

4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails
Legal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue
the rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the
benefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to
impose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only

no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.”); NFIB v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

2 27 U.S.C. 205(e). The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of
title 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.
205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,
to provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the
product, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the
authority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,
analyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the
case of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the
State into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at
5764, col. 1.
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major
allergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements
of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep
(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things
that are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or
importer -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,
applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that
Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”
unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen
labeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue
the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.

Second, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains
Major Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in
fact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that
TTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits
with its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech
that is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,
distilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in
the production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major
allergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the
allergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility
in exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if

none of the allergen in the process ends up in the final product -- confirmed, if
necessary, by appropriate analysis of periodic test samples?’ -- the rule should not
require a label stating that the bottle “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” just because a
major allergen was used at some point in the production process.”

Third, TTB failed to calculate the costs of compliance of the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule. To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:

... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the
cost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry
members would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the
Alcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new
allergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just
one label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°

The TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business
assuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling
Rule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal
duty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and
must consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°
TTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes
of the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a
final Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not
an Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,
but not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to
comply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603

Given the serious shortcomings of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, the
Treasury Department should withdraw the proposed rule.

5. The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails
Legal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the
rule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and
Executive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by
law.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury
Department claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)
chapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)
section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant
the authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration
proposed.

Of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only
three provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)
REQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the
revenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits
issued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,
sale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5
wine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section
5368 provides:

(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and
gauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such
manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).

22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has
no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.
1

(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,
vehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with
this chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

Section 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or
sale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled
in such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be
removed from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled
spirits plants under section 5222.”

The three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.
Section 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for
distilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.
Section 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the
comparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different
from marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to
impose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of
labeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also
that the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to
labeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the
Internal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by
volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412
grants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.
Accordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue
Code to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or
beer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.

The Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol
Facts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements

34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in
one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that
Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).
12

of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the
requirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,
alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.
Also, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes
that Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic
significance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant
alcohol facts labeling authority.

The Treasury Department's triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for
Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2
(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which
it can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide
consumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court
decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.
Circuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional
predecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,
there is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates
Congress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient
disclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of
discretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,
as necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with
that congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the
agency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,
104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme
Court rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which
the Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its

3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were
defined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to
authorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.

meaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their
independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory
authority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9

So, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that
leaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.
Congress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when
it wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”

Second, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little
benefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost
the industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement
(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent
years for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has
no reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to
purchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without
admitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them
to purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling
requirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they
otherwise would have faced.

As for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of
alcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to
quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in
the absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”
assuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.
In the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule:

TTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but
as stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide
consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of
alcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice

about moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional
information about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.

The first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a
thread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts
labeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would
mean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but
carbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.
Also, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery
store), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in
a bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it
might be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts
label diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with
respect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the
Alcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to
compare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a
higher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should
take human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on
assumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

The second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
provide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient
content of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the
proposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing
the additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the
labeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the
labeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.

For the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
greatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.

Thirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-
proposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”

4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information
requirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per
container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of
legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in
a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better
for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who
are pregnant.”).

47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or
any other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a
notice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United
15

TTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5
“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And
immediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
But that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to
the proposed rules.

n

The data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises
(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in
this case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the
proposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account
of recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is
$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298
per year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the
Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making
about $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed
charge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.

Particularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its
decision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities:

The production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an
industry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and
advertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding
more elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant
impact on the regulated industry.°!

The TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding
more labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential
policy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.

NFIB recommends and requests that the Department of the Treasury withdraw the rules
on Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed by the Biden Administration three
days before he left office. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the
Department of the Treasury has no legal authority to promulgate the Biden-proposed
rules and failed to provide the regulatory analyses required in proposing the rules. And
the proposed rules run flatly contrary to the deregulatory policies President Trump has
established by executive order. Withdrawal of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling
and Alcohol Facts rules will prevent imposition of unwarranted, burdensome, and costly
rules on small businesses in the beer, wine, and spirits industry.

This rule represents a long-overdue step toward transparency and consumer protection in the labeling of alcoholic beverages. From a public health standpoint, requiring clear, accessible, and standardized information on alcohol product packaging is essential to empower consumers to make informed choices that support their health and safety. Alcohol is one of the few consumer products ingested orally that is not currently subject to standardized, comprehensive labeling requirements. Unlike packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic products are not required to list basic information such as calories, ingredients, allergens, or nutrients. This lack of labeling leaves consumers in the dark and undermines their ability to make informed decisions. The public health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption are well documented, ranging from motor vehicle accidents and injuries to chronic conditions such as liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and multiple types of cancer. Additionally, alcohol is calorie-dense and contributes significantly to daily energy intake—on average, 9% of daily calories for people who drink. Many products also contain sugars and carbohydrates that contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Requiring Alcohol Facts labeling is a simple, commonsense measure that promotes consumer awareness and aligns alcoholic beverages with the labeling standards already applied to virtually all other consumable products. Support for the Proposed Rule I support this proposed rule as a crucial step forward in advancing transparency, consumer rights, and public health. The inclusion of Alcohol Facts labeling on the packaging of all wine, spirits, and malt beverages is vital to help consumers better understand what they are drinking. In particular, I urge TTB to require that Alcohol Facts be displayed directly on the container and not solely via electronic means, such as QR codes. Electronic-only access to this information would create an unnecessary barrier, especially for populations who are older, lower income, live in rural or tribal areas, or have limited access to smartphones or internet services. On-package labeling ensures equity and accessibility for all consumers. Recommendations to Strengthen the Rule While this proposal is a major advance, several key improvements would enhance its effectiveness: Include Number of Standard Drinks and Moderate Drinking Advice: Consumers need more than nutrient data—they need context. To help consumers understand how much alcohol they are actually consuming, labels should include the number of standard drinks per container and a statement of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans' advice on moderate drinking. This will help align consumer behavior with public health recommendations and provide essential context for evaluating alcohol content. Make Dual-Column Labeling Mandatory: The current proposal allows for voluntary dual-column labeling. However, mandatory dual-column labels—showing nutrition information per serving and per container—are critical, particularly for multi-serving containers such as bottles of wine or large malt beverages. Consumers often consume the entire container, and per-serving-only labeling may mislead or obscure the true nutritional and alcohol content. Expand the Required Nutrient Information: The proposed rule includes calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. While this is a solid foundation, labels should also be required to include added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, which are nutrients that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting due to their connection with major chronic diseases. Including these elements would bring alcohol labels in line with FDA-regulated nutrition labeling for food and beverages. Shorten the Compliance Timeline: TTB has proposed a five-year compliance period. Given how long this issue has been under consideration, and the urgency of providing this information to consumers, I urge TTB to adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years. Manufacturers have had decades of notice that such labeling may be required, and a prompt timeline reflects the seriousness of the public health need. Consumers have a right to know what is in the products they drink. Alcohol is no exception—especially given its known health risks, high calorie content, and widespread consumption. Transparent, consistent, and accessible labeling is essential to public health efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm and improve population health outcomes. I commend TTB for this important proposal and encourage the agency to further strengthen it by implementing the above recommendations.

Recover Alaska strongly supports this rule as a long-overdue and commonsense step toward transparency that will help protect public health and empower consumers to make more informed choices. Recover Alaska is a statewide multi-sector coalition working to reduce excessive alcohol use and its harms across our state. Alaska experiences some of the highest alcohol-related death rates in the country. In 2021, our alcohol-induced mortality rate was more than twice the national average, and Alaska continues to grapple with the ripple effects of alcohol misuse—including high rates of suicide, domestic violence, and child maltreatment. These consequences are deeply felt in our rural and Tribal communities, which already face major health disparities and limited access to services. As a public health organization, we find it unacceptable that alcohol—the only consumable product in the U.S. directly linked to seven types of cancer—is not required to carry a standard nutrition or content label. Consumers have a right to know what is in the products they consume, just as they do with food, tobacco, and other regulated substances. We urge TTB to finalize and strengthen this proposed rule in the following ways: 1. Require On-Package Alcohol Facts Labels Vital health information should not be relegated to QR codes or websites. Labels must appear directly on alcohol packaging to ensure accessibility—especially for people in rural or remote regions, older adults, and those without reliable internet or smartphones. In Alaska, this is particularly relevant where broadband access is limited and supply chains are complex. 2. Include Number of Standard Drinks and DGA Guidance To support informed drinking decisions, labels should include the number of standard drinks per container and refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans' advice on moderate drinking. This helps consumers relate alcohol content to recommended limits and personal health goals. 3. Mandate Dual-Column and Expanded Nutrition Labeling Dual-column labeling (per serving and per container) should be mandatory, not voluntary. Many consumers unknowingly consume an entire container of alcohol in one sitting. Additionally, the Alcohol Facts panel should require disclosure of nutrients the DGA advises limiting: added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. 4. Shorten the Compliance Period to 3.5 Years Public health and safety cannot wait five more years. A 3.5-year compliance period strikes a more appropriate balance between industry readiness and consumers' right to know what they're drinking. As communities and families in Alaska continue to face the heavy burden of alcohol-related harm, this rule represents a simple yet powerful step toward awareness, prevention, and accountability. We commend the TTB for proposing this rule and urge its swift adoption with the enhancements outlined above.

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
Submitted by: Recover Alaska 
Date: August 7, 2025 
To Whom It May Concern, 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule to require Alcohol Facts 
labeling on wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. Recover Alaska strongly supports 
this rule as a long-overdue and commonsense step toward transparency that will help 
protect public health and empower consumers to make more informed choices. 
Recover Alaska is a statewide multi-sector coalition working to reduce excessive alcohol 
use and its harms across our state. Alaska experiences some of the highest alcohol-related 
death rates in the country. In 2021, our alcohol-induced mortality rate was more than twice 
the national average, and Alaska continues to grapple with the ripple effects of alcohol 
misuse—including high rates of suicide, domestic violence, and child maltreatment. These 
consequences are deeply felt in our rural and Tribal communities, which already face major 
health disparities and limited access to services. 
As a public health organization, we ﬁnd it unacceptable that alcohol—the only consumable 
product in the U.S. directly linked to seven types of cancer—is not required to carry a 
standard nutrition or content label. Consumers have a right to know what is in the products 
they consume, just as they do with food, tobacco, and other regulated substances. 
We urge TTB to ﬁnalize and strengthen this proposed rule in the following ways: 
1. Require On-Package Alcohol Facts Labels 
Vital health information should not be relegated to QR codes or websites. Labels 
must appear directly on alcohol packaging to ensure accessibility—especially for 
people in rural or remote regions, older adults, and those without reliable internet or 
smartphones. In Alaska, this is particularly relevant where broadband access is 
limited and supply chains are complex. 
2. Include Number of Standard Drinks and DGA Guidance 
To support informed drinking decisions, labels should include the number of 
standard drinks per container and refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’  
advice on moderate drinking. This helps consumers relate alcohol content to 
recommended limits and personal health goals. 
3. Mandate Dual-Column and Expanded Nutrition Labeling 
Dual-column labeling (per serving and per container) should be mandatory, not 
voluntary. Many consumers unknowingly consume an entire container of alcohol in 
one sitting. Additionally, the Alcohol Facts panel should require disclosure of 
nutrients the DGA advises limiting: added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. 
4. Shorten the Compliance Period to 3.5 Years 
Public health and safety cannot wait ﬁve more years. A 3.5-year compliance period 
strikes a more appropriate balance between industry readiness and consumers’ 
right to know what they’re drinking. 
As communities and families in Alaska continue to face the heavy burden of alcohol-
related harm, this rule represents a simple yet powerful step toward awareness, 
prevention, and accountability. We commend the TTB for proposing this rule and urge its 
swift adoption with the enhancements outlined above. 
Thank you for your leadership in protecting public health through meaningful, transparent 
alcohol policy.

Re:  Comments to TTB Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB–2025–0002) 
 
Dear Director Greenberg,  
 
Campari America LLC (“Campari America”), a producer and importer of distilled spirits in the 
United States, submits the following comments in response to the TTB’s Notice No. 237, “Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ,” Docket No. TTB –2025–
0002.  Campari America is a subsidiary of Davide Campari -Milano N.V., which began in 1860 with its 
one eponymous brand.  Today, Campari America sells a wide range of beverage alcohol products in 
the United States, but is most well-known for its portfolio of liqueurs, including Campari, Aperol, Averna, 
Frangelico, Cynar, Braulio , and Grand Marnier .  Many of t hese brands, like those of many other 
suppliers, are not accurately represented in the TTB’s currently proposed serving size reference table, 
pasted below for reference, and which is the basis of our comment today.   
Serving size Alcohol percent by volume 
Wine Distilled spirits Malt beverages 
1.5 fl oz (44 mL), or 50 mL for 50 
mL containers of distilled spirits 
n/a > 24% > 24%. 
2.5 fl oz (74 mL) > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% 
5 fl oz (148 mL) 7 to 16% > 7, up to 16% > 7, up to 16% 
12 fl oz (355 mL) n/a ≤ 7% ≤ 7%. 
 
Proposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Low ABV Liqueurs Are Consumed in Cocktails 
 
The serving sizes recommended above are based in the assumption that the only means of 
drinking a wine, beer, or spirits beverage is straight, unmixed with other beverages.  While this may be 
mostly true for wine and beer, it is most certainly not true for distilled spirits which often serve as 
“ingredients” in a wide range of cocktails.  By way of example, Aperol , which has an ABV of 11%, is 
most commonly consumed in the form of an Aperol Spritz .  When making the brand’s signature 
cocktail, the typical amount of Aperol used is typically 2 ounces, i.e. less than half of what would be 
considered its reference serving size under the TTB’s proposal.  Another Aperol cocktail growing in 
Docusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 
 
popularity is the Paper Plane (0.75 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz Aperol, 0.75 oz Amaro Nonino, and 0.75 oz 
lemon juice), in which the Aperol consumed is less than 1/5 of the TTB proposed serving size. 
Campari faces a similar issue.  While it can be served in a Campari Spritz (typically 1.5 to 2 
ounces), it is also popularly served in a Boulevardier (1 oz Campari, 1 .5 oz bourbon, and 1 oz sweet 
vermouth) or a Negroni (1 oz Campari, 1 oz gin, and 1 oz sweet vermouth) or a Negroni Sbagliato 
(substitute prosecco for gin ).  There is also the Americano (1oz Campari, 1oz sweet vermouth, and a 
splash of club soda) and the Garibaldi (1.5 oz Campari and the fresh juice of one orange, approximately 
4 oz). 
Examples of similar uses of other low-ABV liqueurs in cocktails abound.  Simply put, these are 
not products that are typically drunk straight.  So while the ABV of a lower proof distilled spirit may be 
similar to wine, it is not consumed in the same manner – thus using the same serving size as wine of 5 
oz., or even 2.5 oz, significantly overstates and distorts the actual serving size of these low ABV liqueurs 
in a way that is misleading and confusing for consumers.  
 
Proposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Ready-To-Drink Canned Products Are Consumed 
 
Conversely, for many other products, such as  ready-to-drink can s of  “hard” seltzers and 
cocktails, the currently proposed serving sizes greatly understate the actual serving sizes of these 
products.  These products are commonly sold in a 12 -oz can and can vary from 3.5% to 1 4% ABV.  
Spirits-based cocktails are not the only beverage alcohol products facing this issue:  many beers and 
other malt-based beverages now exceed 7% ABV yet are sold in the same 12 oz size cans.  Likewise, 
canned wines, with ABVs ranging from 8 to 15%, are also sold in sizes larger than the proposed serving 
size of 5 oz.  In these instances, having a serving size reference range that is less than the container 
size will certainly mislead consumers into thinking they are drinking less alcohol than they really are. 
 
Recommended Serving Sizes Already Have A Long-Established Framework and Methodology 
 
As a proposed solution, we recommend adopting an approach similar to  the methodology of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for recommended serving sizes for food and non-alcoholic 
beverages.  The FDA creates reference points, known as “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed” 
or “RACCs,” for different categories of food and beverage, and the FDA then recommends that 
manufacturers use those RACCs as a guideline for determining their advertised serving sizes.   
 
In the food and non -alcoholic beverage realm, FDA-required labelling became required in the 
1990s.  Consumers are long accustomed to this method of calculation of serving facts, with 
recommended or actual consumption amounts being the guiding factor in determining the size.   The 
general understanding of most consumers is that a serving size reflects the size portion of intended or 
typical consumption, or, in the case of single -serve packs, the container size, rather than being based 
on the amount of one of its components .  One analogy would be if the FDA mandated serving sizes 
based on the grams of protein in a product, such as 5g of protein equals one serving size.  This would 
result in a double serving size for a granola bar, and a very small serving size for beef jerky.  Similarly, 
the TTB’s proposed serving sizes are based on the amount of alcohol in a product, resulting in arbitrary 
and sometimes incorrect serving sizes.  The current proposed TTB’s serving sizes would conflict with 
Docusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 
 
the general understanding of most consumers who have been conditioned for decades to perceive a 
serving size as the recommended amount and/or most customarily consumed amount. 
 
If the TTB were to adopt a serving size reference range that mirrors the FDA ’s process, this 
would allow consumers to buy products and understand serving sizes within a framework that they 
already know and are familiar with from the food and non -alcoholic beverage space.  This w ould also 
accommodate the realities of the types of drinks that consumers are currently havin g or making w ith 
beverage alcohol in the 4% to 30% ABV range and would minimize consumer confusion over  serving 
size, especially with respect to ready-to-drink canned products. 
 
Alternatively, if the TTB wants to maintain the serving size reference ranges proposed in Notice 
No. 237, then another recommendation would be for the TTB to allow an exception for suppliers to 
deviate from the proposed serving size reference range if they  can demonstrate that the proposed 
serving size does not reflect the actual amount of their product that is typically consumed.  This would 
allow the TTB to maintain the current framework but still provide flexibility for those suppliers whose  
products are typically consumed as one part of a cocktails.

COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATION  
G/TBT/N/USA/2183 and G/TBT/N/USA/2182 
Allergen and Nutrition Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States 
of America for providing the opportunity to comment on the draft “ Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ”, notified on 22 
January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2183.  
The mandatory labelling of ‘Major Food Allergen’ referred to in the US proposed 
rulemaking includes fish ingredients. The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required 
when the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify 
wines and beers. 
At a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the 
exposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert 
Committee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the 
European Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an 
established history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the 
reference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of 
exposure for derivative safety assessment. 
The EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or 
fish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen 
labelling. 
As regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, 
the EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines 
on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-
2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars 
included in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to 
highlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory 
indication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, 
contrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated 
on traded alcoholic beverages. 
Finally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed 
5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the 
operators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before 
the proposed rule comes into effect.

The EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comments could be taken into 
account and replied to before adoption of the notified draft.

RE Notice No.os 237 & 238 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages; and Major Food
Allergen Labeling for Wineso Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages
Comments of the Kentuckv Distillers' Association
Dear Director,
We are outside counsel for the Kentucky Distillers' Association, located in
Frankfort, Kentucky (""KDA""). The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits
producers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and
its membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on
potential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.
While the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two
notices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit
comments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise
similar concerns for Kentucky's spirits industry. Please accept the following as the
KDA's comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket
TTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to
require the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of
distilled spirits.
Since the KDA's founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and
responsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky's signature Bourbon and Distilled
Spirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world's
supply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As
such, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and
administrative impact on our members.

1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers
The KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs
associated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft
producers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to
distilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff
and capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be
an expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping
units (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued
testing would be cost prohibitive.
It is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated
to be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits
labels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic
and logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive
packaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real
estate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them
ignore key labeling information altogether.
2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion
The proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces
redundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by
volume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the
requirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further
by requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,
which will result in customer confusion.
Customers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being
quantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on
the Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of
alcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or
misinterpret the label entirely.
Further, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes
proteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed
Alcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in
the product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer
would reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that
there are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.

The KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due
to the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.
3. Digital Labeling Options
Spirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As
discussed, to keep consumers' attention and give them the ability to learn more about
certain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such
an approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy
'click through' for the latest and more in-depth product information.
Moreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for
printing new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant
environmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost
ninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for
helping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less
environmental effects.
4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process
As TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -
including gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a
proper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled
spirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the
exception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled
spirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced
post-distillation.
The KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption
regarding TTB's testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-
case basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself
by requiring lab analysis of every product.
If the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final
rulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due
to the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation
product. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause
tremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be
'gluten-free' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about
gluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill
information or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.
Including more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI

potential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential
customers.
5. Conclusion
As TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to
consider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations
that consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and
other spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are
already well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing
more than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing
inefficiencies.
Sincerely,

Re: TTB‐2025‐0002: Alcohol Facts Statements in the labelling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages 
 
 
The French Federation of Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), appreciates the opportunity to submit comments 
on Notice No. 238 relative to Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FEVS is the trade association representing the wine and spirit exporting companies of France. FEVS's 
membership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with 
exports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for 
French wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). 
 
FEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American 
consumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and 
quality of the wines and spirits they purchase. 
 
Therefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on TTB’s proposed rulemaking. 
 
 
On the title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
FEVS encourages TTB to adopt the tile “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”, as the proposed content 
of the statement refers to nutrition information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverage, rather than 
information on alcohol. Therefore, the title “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest that 
the statement includes general indication on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
 
In addition, consumers are accustomed to the title “ Serving Facts” and to the fact that this is related to 
nutrition information of the beverage they intend to purchase or consume, since most operators who 
currently voluntarily disclose nutrition information use “ Serving Facts ”, as acknowledged by TTB in the 
Notice. As a consequence, choosing the “ Serving Facts” title would also limit costs of re -labelling for these 
operators. 
 
Lastly, FEVS believes that the similarity between “ Serving Facts”, which could apply to alcoholic beverages 
regulated under IRC, and “ Nutrition Facts”, required for alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA rules, is 
more beneficial to consumers as it ensures a kind of coherence on how the nutrition information is provided 
for all products proposed for sale on the market – even if the content of their respective statement may differ 
as proposed by TTB for the former. 
 
2 
On the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
FEVS thanks TTB to take into account particularities of the wines and spirits production process and sector 
by proposing a content of a nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what 
is required for other food products through the FDA Nutrition Facts label. 
 
Nevertheless, FEVS would like to underline that wine or spirits do not contain fat or proteins and is wondering 
whether the compulsory presence of these two elements in a n Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
would provide useful information to consumers when choosing which alcoholic beverage they want to 
purchase or drink. Whether TTB decides to keep these two elements and considering the limited space of 
wine and spirits labels, FEVS suggests allowing operators to replace these two lines by a unique sentence like 
“Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the Statement. 
 
FEVS takes note of the voluntary sugar content  statement as proposed by TTB. In case operators choose to 
indicate it, FEVS kindly requests TTB to clarify how precisely they will have to label it and how the articulation 
with the carbohydrates content TTB intends to require will have to be made. 
 
More globally, FEVS would like to raise the attention of TTB regarding the difficulty adding other elements 
to the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, including through a voluntary approach, 
because of: 
• the non-relevance of nutrients like sodium, cholesterol, saturated fat… for alcoholic beverages, 
• the risk introducing nutrients like vitamins or minerals or percentage of the daily value may lead to 
unintended alcohol consumption behaviors, 
• the fact that the more information is added within the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, the 
more the impact of the most relevant ones for consumers, notably calories, will be diluted, 
• the limited space available on wine and spirits packaging (compared to other food products), 
• the difficulty for operators to put in place the full traceability, risk assessment and analytical procedures 
to guarantee the loyalty and accurate content of such information, 
• the possible impact of such requirement on a trade perspective, for products imported into the US as 
well as for US wine and spirits exported to third countries. 
 
In case TTB is willing to require or to give operators the possibility to include additional elements in the 
Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, FEVS strongly encourages TTB to allow this statement to be 
provided by electronic means like QR-Code (see below). 
 
Finally, FEVS welcomes the tolerance of 20% above or below proposed by TTB as well as the use of “typical 
value” charts in order to ease the ability of wine and spirits operators, especially SMEs, fulfilling the envisaged 
requirements. FEVS strongly encourages TTB to work as far as possible with US trade partners to develop a 
coordinated approach on these “typical values”. 
 
FEVS would like also to stress the importance of including in the TTB regulation the notion of  “average 
values” a s defined by Codex Alimentarius for the nutrition declaration
1. Being complementary to 
tolerances, “average values” would allow operators to provide accurate information to consumers while 
avoiding the re-labelling of their products each year because of crops or evolution of the production method. 
 
 
On the alcohol content statement 
 
FEVS takes note of the TTB proposal requiring an alcohol content statement, expressed as a percentage of 
alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverages products, as well as an indication of this statement 
 
1 See Point 3.5 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling: “The values used in nutrient declaration should be weighted average values 
derived from data speciﬁcally obtained from analyses of products which are representative of the product being labelled.” 3 
within the existing  tolerances (in substitution of an indication in terms of ranges). This is aligned with EU 
rules and will ensure consistency in the presentation of products regardless of their alcohol content. 
 
FEVS would also appreciate whether TTB could clarify if this requirement would apply to non-alcoholic wines 
(less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) sold on the US market, too. 
 
On the other hand, FEVS asks TTB not to require the inclusion of the alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement. While practical modalities regarding the placement of the alcohol content may differ 
between malt beverages, distilled spirits or wines, c onsumers are used to find this information in the same 
field of vision of other compulsory particulars. In addition, under current TTB regulations, the alcohol content 
has to be labelled in a bigger type size than other compulsory information. Therefore, FEVS does not see why 
including alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, among several other elements 
related to the product, will guarantee a better visibility or understanding for consumers. 
 
If TTB want s nevertheless going forward on this, FEVS kindly recommends proposing it as an option for 
operators, allowing them the possibility either to indicate the alcohol content as it is today or to include it in 
the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
FEVS would also like to share concerns regarding the compulsory indication of the alcohol content in fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol. Firstly, concept of pure alcohol is not always well understood by consumers. Thus, 
providing this information without context would not necessarily empower consumers to make informed 
choices or to understand why and how it differs from the alcohol content expressed in volume by alcohol.  
Second, FEVS notes that TTB is allowing operators, in addition to these two elements, to indicate the alcohol 
content in degrees of proof ; meaning the same information could appear in three different forms in the 
Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
Beyond issues related to limited available space o n labels and to the complexity for foreign operators who 
do not usually use the fluid ounces of pure alcohol as unit of measurement, FEVS fears the proposed approach 
could lead to an important risk of confusion by consumers. 
 
In addition, FEVS tends to consider that a “per serving size” presentation could increase the difficulties for 
consumers to fully understand the elements provided in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. As 
rightly pointed out in the Notice, serving size reference amounts could be considered  by consumers as a 
recommended consumption amount rather than a way to determine the  alcohol, nutrient or calorie intake 
of a specific beverage. Besides, since serving size would have to differ depending on  the alcohol content of 
the product, this will prevent consumers from making comparisons between several alcoholic beverages on 
their respective nutritional impact, due to the lack of an identical basis for comparison. 
 
This approach will also lead to additional complexity for wine and spirits companies, especially exporters who 
are not used to managing serving size and/or will have to manage specific ones for the US market. 
 
FEVS would also like to recall that Codex Alimentarius recommends that the nutrition declaration should be 
expressed per 100 ml and “in addition, this information may be given per serving as quantified on the label“
2. 
 
Whether TTB confirms its intention to request nutrition information to be provided in pure alcohol per 
serving, FEVS strongly suggests TTB to allow the electronic display of these elements. Indeed, the presence 
of a QR -Code on a label could facilitate the provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure 
alcohol and standard drinks, including in relation with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans  if relevant, 
which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. It  would also reduce the conformity c osts for 
operators, especially those non-US based,  thanks to  automatic calculation of nutrition content of their 
product and conversion of the figures into US unit measures (see below). 
 
 
 
2 See Point 3.4.2 and 3.43 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling 4 
On the Alcohol Beverages Information Statement disclosure 
 
While acknowledging the flexibilities proposed by TTB for the display of the Alcohol Beverages Information 
Statement (ie, linear display option and lesser rules in terms of format and size on the panel), FEVS strongly 
reiterates its call to TTB for allowing these information to be distributed by electronic means. 
 
As previously raised, electronic labelling offers a wide range of advantages to both consumers and operators, 
especially SMEs. Indeed, this digital mean makes it possible: 
• for companies, to have a tool adapted to the variability of wines and spirits, thus limiting the costs of 
modifying packaging, while guaranteeing the loyalty of the information,  
• for the consumer, an easy and permanent access to information (including for people with disabilities), 
updated in real time and in his own language (in or outside the US territory), 
• for public authorities, to avoid the creation of barriers to trade by facilitating convergence of standards 
and administrative cooperation: 
o between the United States and wine and spirits exporting countries, 
o between federal regulations and the increasing number of labelling requirements in force at 
State level (e.g. with regard to beverage packaging deposits schemes). 
 
It also has to be noted that technological challenges (like adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage) or ability to 
access for particular communities are evolving very quickly, having in mind any final rule on Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement would only apply in more than five years from now. 
 
In the EU, the labelling of energy and nutrition information and the list of ingredients is compulsory for wine 
products since December 2023 and the spirits sector commit to provide these information on a voluntary 
basis. The EU experience demonstrates the possibility of using the advantages of the QR -Code without 
lowering the ability of consumers to access  key information for their health and for making informed 
choice. Indeed, for companies willing to use digital means, EU regulations oblige them to indicate the calories 
amount as well as the allergens on the physical label, while other information, compulsory or not, are 
displayed online, via a direct and free of marketing information link. 
 
FEVS would like to underline how aligning EU and US requirements on nutrition and energy information 
would be beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, while allowing each party to keep 
its own preference on the content of the information to be provided according to its respective context. This 
would also allow the EU  and US to set a global standard which could support the development of digital 
technologies and avoid trade barriers in third countries market. 
 
In the case of physical labelling, FEVS requests to remove the black box around the Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement, especially when provided in a linear format . This appear not to be proportionate 
or justified as the title “ Serving Facts” in bold type on a defined space which is a label is sufficient to allow 
consumers to easily locate the information on the packaging. 
 
On the implementation period 
 
FEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the statement. 
 
In addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to 
put on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force 
of any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. 
 
Finally, if TTB adopt s a final rule on Major Food Allergens labelling (as envisaged in Notice  of proposed 
rulemaking No. 238), FEVS asks for an identical date of entry into force for both regulations . This will 
prevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost this approach could have for 
them, especially for SMEs.

Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various harms including injuries, motor vehicle accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Consumers must be better informed. I agree that the ""Alcohol Facts"" disclosure should be required to appear on-package and never solely via electronic means (a QR code leading to a webpage), as this would place a barrier between consumers and this vital information and specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology (e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land). In order to provide consumers with access to this long-overdue, basic information, TTB should adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed In summary please adopt clear labeling requirements to inform consumers about nutritional content, calories, alcohol content and warnings about cancer and other potential health hazards associated with alcoholic beverages.

Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement

*We consider that the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided inthe proposed statement.*

Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information

*Following the same rationale applied to nutritional information, sugar content should remain voluntary. If most alcohol beverages contain only minimal or negligible amounts of sugar, requiring its inclusion would provide little added value to consumers. Similarly, we agree with TTB’s assessment that sodium and other micronutrients should not be included, and we believe they should not be referenced in the proposal at all.*

*We believe that including daily value percentages for nutrients on alcohol beverage labels would be confusing for consumers. Such information could misleadingly suggest that alcohol contributes meaningfully to meeting daily nutritional requirements, which is not the case. Given the fundamental differences between alcoholic beverages and foods, adopting the Nutrition Facts format used by the FDA would not be appropriate in this context.*

*Given that many alcoholic beverages contain negligible amounts of nutrients beyond calories, requiring full nutrition facts similar to FDA food labels could be unnecessarily burdensome and confusing, potentially disadvantaging certain products in both domestic and international markets.*

Calculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels

*We support the proposed tolerances of ±20% and the use of ""typical values"" as a valid alternative to mandatory testing. Allowing broad tolerances and the use of tables or calculation methods to estimate nutrient levels is important to keep costs down and maintain competitiveness. Requiring precise in-house testing or sending products to third-party labs would create significant financial challenges, especially for small producers who make small batches and cannot spread testing costs over many units.*

Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products

*We have no objections to the proposal requiring an alcohol content statement expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume on all alcohol beverage labels. This requirement does not pose any issues, as it is already mandatory in Argentina to indicate the alcohol content on all wines. Such labeling ensures transparency for consumers and aligns with existing international practices.*

Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement

*While it is likely that including alcohol content information within the Alcohol Facts statement could make it easier for consumers to locate this information, this advantage may not be particularly significant. Consumers are generally accustomed to looking for alcohol content in various parts of the label, and the overall impact on their ability to find this information is expected to be minimal.*

*The implications of including the alcohol content within the Alcohol Facts statement should be carefully analyzed to avoid the requirement of declaring the alcohol content in two separate locations on the label. According to the World Wine Trade Group (WWTG) Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling, wines may display common mandatory information (CMI), including alcohol content, anywhere on the container’s surface visible within a single field of vision. This approach helps ensure clarity and prevents redundant labeling. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the agreements established within the WWTG. If the information must appear in multiple locations on the label, this could increase label redesign and printing costs. Additionally, unclear placement requirements might lead to confusion among producers, complicating compliance efforts and potentially increasing administrative burdens. Moreover, having the alcohol content displayed in two different places with differing values could lead to labeling errors and mislead consumers.*

Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol per Serving

*If it is mandatory to indicate the alcohol content as a percentage by volume, requiring additional information about the alcohol content per serving size or standard drink would be redundant and could potentially confuse or mislead consumers. Providing multiple measures of alcohol content on the label may create inconsistency and make it harder for consumers to clearly understand the actual alcohol strength of the product.*

Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

a. Linear Display

*We believe it would be appropriate to provide the option for Alcohol Facts information to be presented either in a panel or linear format, as proposed.*

b. Type Size

*We agree with the proposal that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements should mirror the existing type size requirements for mandatory information*

c. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

*We suggest allowing the possibility of using electronic means, such as QR codes, to present this information, especially for small containers or labels with limited space, while ensuring that mandatory physical labeling remains the minimum requirement.*

Serving Size Reference Amounts

*Proposed serving size amounts should be reference values only. Each consumer, if interested, can evaluate their total intake of alcohol, nutrients, and calories when consuming amounts greater than the reference serving size. The reference amounts serve their purpose by providing a consistent basis for labeling and informing consumer choices without implying a recommended level of consumption.*

*According to Wine in Moderation, the reference consumption guidelines are: up to 2 units of alcohol per day for women (equivalent to approximately 200 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV), and up to 3 units per day for men (approximately 300 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV). Additionally, no more than 4 units of alcohol should be consumed on a single drinking occasion.*

Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display

*We agree with allowing the option to present Alcohol Facts in a dual-column format.*

*We also support the proposal requiring containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving.*

Implementation Period

*The proposed 5-year compliance period for the new labeling regulations is both adequate and reasonable, as it allows the industry ample time to adapt gradually without imposing excessive economic or operational pressures. This timeframe helps minimize costs and facilitates a smooth transition toward more comprehensive and transparent labeling for consumers.*

*However, a shorter period (e.g., 3 years) could be considered only if the labeling is limited to basic elements (alcohol content and calories) and does not include a broader set of nutrients or ingredient declarations.*

*It is likely that some industry members will choose to begin implementing the labeling changes before the official compliance date. Many producers may prefer to adapt to the new requirements earlier to stay ahead of regulations and manage inventory efficiently.*

*Furthermore, it is essential that new label approval applications (COLA) are not required when changes are limited to the inclusion or modification of nutritional information, such as the Alcohol Facts panel or data on calories and alcohol content.*",0,-1,"[-1, 1, 24]",-1,1,24,neutral,0.997550904750824,"{'admiration': 7.58316382416524e-05, 'amusement': 8.840000373311341e-05, 'anger': 0.00010136599303223193, 'annoyance': 0.00025432716938667, 'approval': 0.00047078923671506345, 'caring': 4.5586435589939356e-05, 'confusion': 0.0001529846922494471, 'curiosity': 7.3584946221672e-05, 'desire': 3.070889943046495e-05, 'disappointment': 0.00010492726869415492, 'disapproval': 0.00012861783034168184, 'disgust': 6.0464077250799164e-05, 'embarrassment': 2.7156131181982346e-05, 'excitement': 6.982008198974654e-05, 'fear': 6.82524114381522e-05, 'gratitude': 4.504021126194857e-05, 'grief': 1.689855707809329e-05, 'joy': 6.833356019342318e-05, 'love': 3.090200334554538e-05, 'nervousness': 1.7831180230132304e-05, 'optimism': 7.331716187763959e-05, 'pride': 1.1147639270348009e-05, 'realization': 0.00028061174089089036, 'relief': 1.3445260265143588e-05, 'remorse': 1.4519309843308292e-05, 'sadness': 8.336851897183806e-05, 'surprise': 4.086816989001818e-05, 'neutral': 0.997550904750824}"

TTB Proposal on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. 
Key points of the proposal: 
 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: 
1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). 
2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. 
3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 
4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal 
establishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary 
depending on their alcohol content. For example: 
i. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) 
ii. Wines: 
1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. 
2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. 
iii. Distilled spirits: 
1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; 
2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; 
3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid 
ounces (44 ml) 
4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. 
 
 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
Compliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register 
is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
Comments on the proposal: 
 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but 
question the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not 
considered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-
006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the 
declaration of the product's alcohol content. 
 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of 
alcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested 
that this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, 
digital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. 
 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as 
if these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius 
guidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and 
that nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do 
the differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  
misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s 
labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the 
listed nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? 
Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol 
beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? 
Our position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely 
benefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage 
labeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels 
could easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which 
would only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting 
nutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that 
alcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing 
decisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. 
Furthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are 
fundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic 
beverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol 
itself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as 
somehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current 
labeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are 
distinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, 
which goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT 
Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers 
to international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly 
recommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This 
makes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
 Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
 Easy updating as regulations change. 
 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks 
of harmful alcohol consumption. 
 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to 
implement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for 
distribution in the U.S. 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
It is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and 
trans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the 
misconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
The inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be 
misle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could 
confuse consumers. 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create 
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
It is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could 
create a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true 
and could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or 
rehabilitation benefits. 
The General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be 
limited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them 
as something that improves health or well-being. 
Furthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages 
from being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from 
promoting harmful eating habits. 
The Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition 
by establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, 
rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or 
health benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such 
declarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the 
identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol 
Facts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated 
with such revisions? 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate 
unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
This measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and 
distributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would 
go against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical 
regulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives 
justified by member states. 
According to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly 
necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures 
would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased 
costs associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new 
shipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, 
new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, 
especially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  
analyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply 
chains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
It is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade 
in alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to 
consider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the 
use of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical 
labels, while reducing operational costs. 
Conclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol 
is sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided 
electronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant 
costs, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic 
beverages in general.

Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Introduction 
spiritsEUROPE represents the interests of the European distilled spirits industry. Our members include 
31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base 
in Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion 
in 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United 
States. 
 
We would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” to the WTO TBT Committee. We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if 
needed. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as flexible as possible, and do not result 
in unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while ensuring the meaningful information of 
consumers. 
 
In this context, spiritsEUROPE would like to highlight the following key requests: 
• Replace the title of the informational statement with “Serving Facts” instead of “Alcohol 
Facts” to more accurately reflect its content.  
• Permit the use of digital tools , particularly QR codes , to provide the “Serving Facts” 
statement to minimise the impact of the new rules on trade, align with existing industry 
practices and self-regulation, as encouraged by the European Commission, and – for wine – 
existing EU requirements. 
• Keep the inclusion of ABV and the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the “Serving Facts” 
optional, as the ABV is already stated elsewhere on the container and the concept of ""pure 
alcohol"" is not widely understood by consumers. 
• Introduce greater flexibility regarding serving sizes, as they vary across countries and can also 
depend on the category of spirits and the alcohol content of the product. 
• Ensure both proposals enter into force simultaneously and include a stock exhaustion clause 
for all products placed on the market prior to implementation. 
 
You will find our detailed comments and recommendations on these proposals below. 
 
I. Comments on the “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages” 
1. On the Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
We believe that the title of the informational statement should be “Serving Facts” and not “Alcohol 
Facts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the nutritional information in a 
serving of a specific alcoholic beverage . “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest 
that the statement includes general indications on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. In 
addition, consumers are accustomed to finding nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement 
because most operators who currently voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the 
title.

2. On the Display of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) 
 
spiritsEUROPE would kindly recommend that TTB allow the possibility to make the “Serving Facts” 
statement available electronically, in particular through the use of a QR code. Although exempted to 
do so by EU law, the EU spirits sector decided to develop an ambitious self -regulatory approach to 
provide consumers with: 
• (language free) energy information on the back label (per 100ml and serving, in kJ and Kcal – 
as is standard for other food and beverages  in the EU) including the number of portions per 
container; and 
• the full nutrition al information (including fat, carbohydrates and protein) via the scanning a 
QR code present on the back label. 
 
The latest report published on 18 June 2024  shows that the share of spirit  drinks bottles complying 
with the self-regulatory commitment on the provision of consumer information has grown from 0% to 
70% in just 5 years. 
 
Companies are also increasingly mirroring this approach outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. 
 
While this approach is a self -regulatory commitment for the spirits sector in the EU, it is a legal 
requirement for the wine sector since 8 December 2023, including for US wine bottles exported to the 
European Union. Aligning EU and US requirements on nutritional and energy information would be 
beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since EU requirements for 
wine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well beyond the EU. 
 
On the other hand, considering the high number of EU spirits companies that provide nutritional 
information digitally, having two substantially different systems in the main markets of both partners 
would create a significant barrier to trade . This would negatively affect both US and EU companies 
seeking to export to the other market. 
 
The benefits of a single, aligned  approach that combines on -pack labelling and digital labelling 
elements are manifold. Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and 
user-friendly feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a 
smart phone or other electronic device.  
 
In addition, digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: 
• Digital labels empower economic operators to swiftly update information  and to adapt 
information to consumers easily, while reducing waste and costs associated to changes with 
traditional physical labels, thus promoting sustainability. 
• Recycling information and other sustainability -related information can easily be integrated 
into digital labels. One such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling 
information for glass bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible 
digital labels since last year.  
• Digital labelling is also SME friendly : craft producers will benefit from being able to provide 
digital consumer information as it enables them to drastically cut down on labelling costs and 
explore new markets, for instance thanks to the geo-sensitive nature of QR codes. This is true 
for craft producers from overseas, who will find it easier to enter the US market, providing 
consumers with more choice in the process. This is equally true for US craft operators, who 
will be better able to export to other markets by making use of digital labelli ng to minimise 
differences and reduce costs.   
 
In the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical label, 
we would kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by a 
box. We would like to stress  that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement,   
 3 
regulations should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The 
space available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would unnecessarily 
take up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in bold type is sufficient 
to allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label. 
 
3. On the Content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) 
 
As noted above, the space available on a label of distilled spirits is limited . We therefore appreciate 
that the TTB is not proposing to align the “Serving Facts” statement with the Nutrition Facts Label of 
the FDA. We also welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations. 
 
However, in the spirit of facilitating international trade of alcoholic beverages, we would like to 
reiterate our recommendation that the TTB aligns its proposal with the requirements in the EU for 
wines (including US wines exported to the EU) , i.e. to require the provision of energy information on 
the label and of nutritional information online. 
 
Whether online or on the label, the “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the 
alcohol content statement (alcohol by volume, ABV) . As the Notice  rightly points out , for distilled 
spirits, the ABV is already required to appear  in the same field of vision as the brand name and the 
class designation. Consumers are therefore used to finding this information on the main/front label. 
Particularly in the case of physical label, space is limited and adding it to the “Serving Facts” would not 
add any value.  
 
In addition, we would kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving 
in the “Serving Facts” statement optional . Providing this information without context would not 
necessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pure alcohol is not well 
understood. On the other hand, the presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the provision of 
substantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary 
Guidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. 
 
Finally, we very much welcome the fact  that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA 
applications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion  or alteration of the “Serving 
Facts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the inclusion or 
alteration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” statement in this manner. 
 
4. On the Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts 
 
We would also welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes.  We believe the 
proposed approach to serving sizes does not accurately reflect how our products are usually 
consumed. 
 
Serving sizes can vary from country to country and vary depending on the ABV of the product. There 
is a wide variety of spirits above 24% and the serving size of a 65% ABV absinthe would be different to 
that of a 24% ABV liqueur. 
 
In addition, this approach fails to take into account that lower ABV spirits (such as liqueurs ) are 
typically consumed as part of mixed drinks rather than as standalone pours. Mandating rigid serving 
sizes based solely on ABV thresholds may mislead consumers and conflict with customary serving 
practices and supplier recommendations. For instance, liqueurs and cordials often recommended in 2 
oz (60 ml) pours could be inaccurately represented by a 5 oz (150 ml) serving size under the proposed 
rules. This misalignment risks confusing consumers, undermining brand integrity, and inadvertently 
encouraging higher alcohol and calorie consumption. 
  
 4 
The proposed approach also fails to account for the rapidly growing Ready -to-Drink (RTD) category, 
where products with very similar profiles but slightly different ABVs (e.g., 7% vs 8%) could be subject 
to inconsistent and confusing serving size declarations. 
 
Rather than enforcing a one -size-fits-all mode l, we urge TTB to allow producers flexibility in 
determining an appropriate serving size reflective of how the product is intended to be enjoyed. This 
could be done by retaining the current serving size guidelines as optional defaults, while also 
permitting customised serving sizes where justified by product type and consumption patterns. This 
flexible approach would provide consumers with more accurate and meaningful information while 
allowing producers to maintain control over their product presentation and brand integrity. 
 
5. On the Proposed Implementation Period 
 
spiritsEUROPE welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic 
climate for our sector, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for our members. 
  
We would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on 
the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of our products can often 
be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. 
 
Finally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into force is 
aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.

To Whom It May Concern, 
 
GS1 US appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau's (TTB) proposal to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient 
content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels. As an 
organization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US understands the importance of 
leveraging data and technology to improve transparency and enhance consumer access to detailed 
product information that supports informed decision making. We commend TTB’s commitment to 
these goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute our insights. 
 
For over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver 
safe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC 
barcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners 
identify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions 
of businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 
members across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage 
production, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. 
 
As a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify 
industry challenges and build consensus on best practices for solving them by leveraging global 
standards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global 
standards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards 
help empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access 
to the information they want and need about those products. 
 
2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Alcohol Labeling 
GS1 US recognizes the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with 
essential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, 
particularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid 
in achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as the UPC barcode, can only hold a limited 
amount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of  
 
www.gs1us.org  2 
storing much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates, 
vintage, age, and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing 
comprehensive information in a compact format. 
 
Incorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) – the globally unique 
product identifier embedded in UPCs today - can effectively support consumer access to detailed 
nutrition information. The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and 
consumer value of digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform 
launched in 2015 to provide detailed product information via QR codes, which leverage GS1 
Standards. This approach is in line with food industry initiatives like SmartLabel® and promotes 
consumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. This digital approach can 
work in tandem with the required physical label disclosures, enhancing the essential information 
presented to consumers. It not only meets the transparency goals of the proposed rule but also 
enables future enhancements, including ingredient disclosures, allergen declarations, information 
regarding sustainability practices, or responsible consumption messaging.  
 
A GS1 Digital Link enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and 
nutritional information, including allergens and dynamic data such as recalls or safety alerts, 
through a simple smartphone scan. In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and 
nutritional information, 2D barcodes encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and 
interoperable format, ensuring accuracy and consistency across retail and digital platforms.  
Including the GTIN in a QR code with GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product 
information. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into gateways to consumer 
information, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand loyalty while improving 
supply chain traceability. 
 
Moreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up valuable label 
space. QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater 
capacity for information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing 
comprehensive data. Moreover, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already 
familiar with scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American 
adults use smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said that they would scan a QR 
code to access product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers 
consumers to easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. 
 
 
Application of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information 
GS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification 
and efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open standards can significantly 
enhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be applied to 
support industry compliance with Alcohol Facts requirements: 
 
1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, 
parties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the  
 
www.gs1us.org  3 
manufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to 
recognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information. 
2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies 
such as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical 
information like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate 
capture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. 
3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data 
formats allows for seamless information exchanges across the supply chain. This 
transparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their 
confidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by 
facilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. 
 
Conclusion 
Incorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN identification, 2D barcodes, and GS1 Digital 
Link into the TTB’s Alcohol Facts labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance consumer 
access to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only help industry stakeholders 
efficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future advancements in 
the digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively with TTB, industry 
partners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of this important 
initiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the opportunity to 
contribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol beverage 
products.

That makes sense because ABV can vary greatly and has a direct impact on safe consumption. However, alcohol is not a ""food product"" and is a non-essential beverage — trying to regulate it as though it were a packaged grocery item sets a troubling precedent. If a producer chooses to include calorie or nutritional information voluntarily to appeal to a certain consumer segment, that's their choice. It may even be a marketing advantage. But I strongly oppose making it mandatory. Wine already has an age restriction for purchase; adults choosing to drink assume a certain amount of personal risk. We don't need to ""helicopter"" consumers with more mandated warnings and panels. This proposal would also create a logistical nightmare for the industry. Labels are already required to include a large amount of information — varietal, vintage, appellation, health warnings, alcohol content — and space is limited. For smaller bottles and unique designs, there is physically no room to add another standardized panel without removing existing legally required or brand elements. Costs would be significant, especially for small and mid-size producers who already face thin margins. Every label change means design work, printing costs, and compliance delays. For wineries producing multiple SKUs, the burden multiplies. Ingredient listing requirements raise further concerns. Will winemakers have to list fining agents such as bentonite, casein, or egg whites, even though they're removed before bottling? Will common enological tools like potassium bicarbonate or tartaric acid need to be spelled out, potentially alarming consumers unfamiliar with normal winemaking practices? The average person has no context for these terms and may assume they are ""additives"" to avoid, even when they're safe and essential to quality. If the intent is transparency, there are better options. Linking a QR code or website with batch-specific information allows for accuracy and flexibility without forcing constant label reprints. This also avoids the need to ""freeze"" data on a printed label that may vary from vintage to vintage. In short, this proposal creates more confusion than clarity, risks consumer misunderstanding, imposes high costs on producers, and opens the door to further overreach by treating alcohol as a packaged food product. I urge the TTB to reject this rule and instead explore voluntary or digital disclosure methods that work for both consumers and the industry.",me8-qhb8-rvpw,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,Anonymous,Anonymous,,,,,2025-08-12 04:00:00,0,2025-08-15 13:38:38,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"I agree with listing alcohol content pursuant to current requirements.

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA, dedicated to promoting evidence-based policies that protect public health and safety. We would like to offer the following comments on the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposed rulemaking for 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237.    It is past time for the baseline labeling requirements for alcoholic beverages to be brought in line with those of nearly every other food product. As a consumable product, alcohol is responsible for a substantial morbidity and mortality burden, causing 178,000 deaths per year in the United States, of which 117,000 were due to health complications arising from drinking recklessly over the long term.1 Yet in many cases, consumers have little knowledge about what is in a bottle of alcohol—extending even to how much alcohol, the key ingredient that exempts these products from labeling requirements, the package contains.  The need for these extends far beyond a general intent to support the public’s health. Surveys show that consumers have overwhelming expressed support for additional information when purchasing alcoholic products, 77% strongly supporting more information on alcohol content specifically.2 This information is critical for supporting emerging alcohol consumption trends, which increasingly favor “mindful drinking” that centers intentionality, control, and a deeper understanding of how consumption impacts the body.3 We applaud TTB’s efforts to move forward with regulation that addresses this information gap.  We would like to offer the following feedback to TTB’s specified concerns. We are not addressing all questions posed in the Request for Comment, only those for which we believe we have public health-centered arguments.  Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Sheet  
1.  “Alcohol Facts” is preferable to “Serving Facts” as it centers the idea that alcohol is not a nutrient and alcoholic products are not a standard part of any diet. It also flags that there can and will be information in that area that goes beyond what would be expected on a standard label, specifically alcohol content.  3.  Consumers will reflexively seek content information in the same place they find it with other products. For the purposes of alcoholic beverages, that would be the white box with specific product contents specified, even if said box is labeled “Alcohol Facts” instead of “Serving Facts”.   4. “Alcohol Facts” would provide some helpful distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, but only for motivated consumers. If drawing a clear distinction is a priority—and with the explosion of “crossover products” that use a known nonalcoholic brand identity to sell alcoholic beverages,4 TTB should be establishing further plans to require clear disambiguation.  Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information  1.  We support harmonizing the “Alcohol Facts” requirements with standing FDA requirements. A large part of this support is based on the principal that alcoholic beverages should not be exempt from simple obligations to inform that every other consumable has to abide by. We recognize the concern about consumers assuming they can get nutrients from alcohol consumption, however the industry already engages in misleading health impact claims.5 The irony is that, at present, voluntary “Nutrition Facts” labels are often used to support these claims, while the relative validity of them is untestable because so many products opt not to have those labels. In this instance, consistency creates accountability.  2, 3.  We support as close an analogy to the FDA warnings as possible, even in the case of nutrients that are rarely found in alcoholic products, because rarity is not the same as a guarantee that a product will not have an exceptional amount of sodium or trans-fats.  4.  So long as the producer is allowed to claim an alcoholic beverage contains any given vitamin or mineral, they should be obligated to attest to the amount that is in the container.  6. Popular support for “Alcohol Facts” is quite high, ranging from 64% for nutritional content to 77% for alcohol content.2 Being able to not only understand that contents of an alcoholic beverage, but to be able to compare them while in the store, forms a core principle of informed shopping—as well as a core principle of bodily autonomy, when you consider the fact that without them most people do not know what is going into their bodies. On a less abstract level, across-the-board nutrient labeling allows consumers to avoid nutrients they wish to avoid, and to verify claims made by manufacturers.  9. Although international regulations are heterogenous, there is no case in which erring on the side of more on-label information would complicate an export—but many cases in which too little on-label information would do so.   Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products  1.  The exemption from alcohol by volume (ABV) labeling for “table wines” creates an explicit health hazard. The range of strengths under which labeling is not necessary creates an inability for the consumer to responsibly track their consumption. The risks from acute overconsumption, when comparing e.g. half a bottle of 8% ABV wine to half a bottle of 13% ABV wine, are moderate but present. The risks from chronic consumption at that level are substantial. While we maintain that the “j-shaped curve” is largely an artifact of poor study design,6 even studies which support that curve find that purported benefits evaporate for both sexes at consumption levels of 3 drinks per day or more.7 With the enormous ranges of tolerance within table wine labeling, it can easily lead to unwitting overconsumption.  3. An increase in tolerance for reported ABV on packaging very easily can lead someone to consume more than they intended, particularly within larger bottles and similar containers. This could create severe health impacts over the long run.  4. Based on the principle that all products sold for consumption should be transparent about ingredients, “non-alcoholic” malt beverages should also be subject to nutrition labeling requirements.  6. A range of content as wide as “7% to 14%” is tantamount to not providing any information about ABV.  It is impossible to plan for one’s alcohol intake when the information given is so uncertain.   Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement  1.  The preferred venue for alcohol content information would be on the front of the label, in large type, in a readily legible font. Having alcohol content information in addition be part of the Alcohol Facts label would still serve consumers well, however.  It would be easy to locate, would facilitate comparison between products, potentially reduce the ability of producers to disguise ABV—or, in some cases, market a clearly dangerous level of alcohol as part of the design.  2. The Alcohol Facts should err on the side of more information and greater uniformity between products’ labels. If a consumer is looking at two products’ labels, and one has alcohol content while the other does not, it increases the burden on them to find the needed information.   Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving  1.  We stand with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in pushing for standing servings of alcohol to be included on packaging. Every interpretive step a consumer has to take makes an informed decision more difficult. Currently, USDA and other Federal consumption advice takes the form of a standard drink. 8 Unless there is a cross-agency plan to shift advice to center on fluid oz., the current label still creates challenges to advancing the most impactful outcome from alcohol per serving labeling: avoiding dangerous patterns of consumption.    3. Standard drink should be defined and used in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. This becomes crucial when you get to packaging that does not adhere to the sizes used in Federal advisories. Consumers tend to interpret a “drink,” particularly in the case of non-resealable containers, and this leads to persistent underestimation of the amount of alcohol they are actually consuming.9  For instance, a 16 oz. can at 6.9% ABV could be reflexively considered one drink. However, both because of the high alcohol content and the added volume, it far exceeds that, and two containers of this per night would be well over the hazardous chronic consumption threshold. Research suggests that the reflexive assumption of one “drink” per container can be altered through education,10 but for the TTB label revisions to facilitate that, the information must be standardized and easily referenced against an easily memorized standard—which already exists in the form of the standard drink.  In light of TTB’s concerns with legibility, a conservative alternative would be to provide standard drinks within a range, e.g. “0.5–1 standard drink,” “2-3 standard drinks,” etc.  So long as the upper bound is equal to or greater than the actual number of standard drinks, it would ensure that informed and accurate decisions could be made in terms of health impact.   4. The labels should have a definition of “drink,” as well as a commonly accepted, verifiable risk threshold for chronic harm in terms of drinks per day, that aligns with and can be checked against a reputable source.   5.  As of this writing, preliminary reports are that the United States Department of Agriculture will not be defining hazardous levels of drinking in the forthcoming dietary guidelines. If this is the case, then we recommend defining highly risky drinking according to definitions set forth by NIAAA or a reputable NGO such as the American Medical Association.   Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information  1.  Linear display of Alcohol Facts should be acceptable so long as it is consistent among containers of that size. Allowing producers to choose between two formats, however, would add to consumer confusion and impede the intended benefits to consumers.  2.  A box is a simple and expedient way to standardize the appearance of Alcohol Facts across producers, which should be the goal. While there are other ways to create a readily identifiable standard, the box makes for a straightforward and unambiguous requirement.  3.  We also strongly urge TTB to adopt dimensional limits on type beyond simply font size, since poor kerning or highly condensed fonts (such as those used in the legacy health warning on alcoholic beverages) are extremely difficult to read.  7. Anything other than putting ingredients, nutrition facts, servings per package, and standard drinks per package directly on the bottle is a mistake. QR codes suffer from a number of shortcomings.  First, there are equity concerns about labels that are only visible via smartphone. They assume consumers own smartphone, which, although common, are expensive products and not universal.11 They assume regular access to cellular connection. And they create an additional burden on the consumer to access and compare the information they are seeking. These burdens are not distributed equally, but tend to disproportionately impact individuals in rural areas, those with lower socioeconomic status, and older consumers.   There is a secondary concern that the chain of custody for the Alcohol Facts data becomes increasingly baroque as we begin adding in digital storage. This creates inaccuracies and accountability issues, which not only risk discouraging consumers seeking good information, but in making audits and corrections increasingly more difficult.   Lastly, Alcohol Facts through QR codes contain no guarantees that consumers would not, for instance, have to provide contact information, or be protected from cookies and other web traffic monitoring being enabled on their devices. The simple act of enjoying a consumer’s right to know should never be a channel for surreptitious information harvesting, especially when it regards products for which aggressive, targeted marketing can create serious psychological and physical problems for the consumer.   QR codes, in short, build sizable, gratuitous walls between consumers and the information they deserve, and make consumers more vulnerable to predatory marketing.   9. Electronic disclosure should not be allowed. If it were, however, information with immediate consequences to health should still be on the bottle, including alcohol content, standard drinks, and sugars.  10. Not only would allowing multiple options create consumer confusion, it would undermine the value of universal Alcohol Fact labeling requirements in validating marketing claims. Once again, producers would put on-package labels for products billed as “healthy” while burying the labels for other products on a website.    Serving Size Reference Amounts  1.  The specified fluid ounce/milliliter quantities on the Alcohol Facts labels will be difficult for consumers to picture.9 A graphical explainer, showing how much of a standard wine glass, shot glass, or beer stein each quantity refers to, would be essential. For some categories—especially the 2.5 fl. oz. and 5 fl. oz. sizes—the ABV range covered within in that serving size creates a large discrepancy in standard drinks. For the 2.5 fl. oz. category, the upper bound is the same as a serving of “standard” distilled spirits.  For the 5 fl. oz., however, the upper bound (16% ABV) would be substantially more, as is 12 fl. oz. at 7% ABV.    All of this would be obviated, of course, by using standard drinks. Failing that, the ABV upper bounds for each serving size should be set to be the equivalent of one standard drink.  3. Any flexibility in serving size should come with the obligation to clearly, graphically describe the quantity of that specific alcoholic beverage being referred to.  4. Standard drinks are the only quantity framing which has utility in empowering consumers to engage in healthier behavior. It is correct to say that this does not reflect the way that beverages are consumed. The outcome from that, however, would not be confused consumers, but rather health-motivated consumers eschewing single-serve containers with excessive standard drinks.   Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Display Panel  1. Dual-column nutritional facts in food products have been shown to influence consumption behavior even in individuals not actively looking to change behavior, with non-dieting individuals eating as much as dieting individuals when given dual-column nutritional details.12 As such, TTB should expect that dual-column Alcohol Facts labeling will result in moderated consumption, not in normalizing consuming more servings.  2. Five-plus serving, non-resealable containers definitely exist in the U.S. alcohol market, and are among the most dangerous products sold. Anything that encourages purchasers to consume less than the full quantity should be applauded, and evidence from food studies suggest that dual-column displays should do that.  3. There should be no upper bound on standard servings per container before a dual-column label is used. The obvious threshold should be the nature of the container itself; if a container has more than one serving and is not resealable, it should be expected to carry a dual-column label.  4. Having a vague threshold of 200% of serving reference size before a dual-column label is required may result in the proliferation of packaging that is 199% the size of a regular serving. The easiest way to obviate this is to set the cutoff at 100%.   Again, we are grateful to TTB for undertaking this effort, and for giving us the opportunity to comment. As public understanding of alcohol risk increases, the demand for accessible, accurate information grows as well. While we feel there are still some shortcomings in how alcohol quantities are being conveyed to consumers, this rulemaking will still greatly improve their abilities to take control of their health and wellbeing. We are at your disposal for any input that might help TTB as the final rulemaking takes shape.   Respectfully,

A. INTRODUCTION 
Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) represents the wine companies in the industry and trade in the 
European Union. Its members produce and market the vast majority of quality European wines, with and without 
a geographical indication, and account for over 90% of European wine exports. Micr o and small and medium -
sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU wine sector, representing more than 9 9% of wine 
companies. 
In 2024, European wines accounted for approximately 64% of the volume and 78% of the value of total U.S. wine 
imports. That year, the European Union exported an estimated €4.9 billion worth of wine to the United States . 
This robust transatlantic trade reflects the enduring demand for European wines by US consumers.  
CEEV thanks the US authorities for the opportunity offered to comment on Notice No. 237 (Docket No. TTB -
2025-0002), which proposes mandatory Alcohol Facts Statements on labels of wines, distilled spirits, and malt 
beverages. 
B. CEEV COMMENTS 
CEEV shares TTB’s commitment to enhancing consumer access to product information and promoting informed 
choices. In this spirit, we wish to offer constructive input to ensure that any future labelling requirements take 
into account the specific characteristics of wine and the operational context European wine exporters to the US. 
CEEV believes that certain elements of the TTB’s proposed approach should be adapted to better account for 
wine’s unique characteristics, limited label space, production variability, and the need for alignment with 
international practices, in order to avoi d placing disproportionate burdens on EU wine producers, particularly 
small and medium-sized enterprises. 
In this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: 
 
1. Digital labelling to be authorized for wine Serving Facts disclosure 
Wine is an agricultural product defined by natural variations depending on the characteristics of the harvest. 
Unlike other products, wine is not made to a fixed recipe and its nutritional composition, especially sugar and 
therefore calorie content, can fluctuate significantly depending on climate conditions, fermentation choices, and 
vintage conditions and cannot be known until shortly before the wine is bottled.  
 
Mandatory physical nutritional labelling would place a disproportionate burden on producers, particularly small 
CEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  
Notice No. 237 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages   
 
 
and medium -sized European wineries where wine is often produced in limited batches, with labels printed 
before final composition is confirmed. Requiring precise data would mean repeated testing and reprinting, 
adding significant cost and complexity. For many European wine producers, these obligations could be financially 
unmanageable and may discourage exports to the US, reducing diversity and choice. 
 
Wine labels already carry substantial mandatory information, such as origin, varietal, vintage, and legal 
designations, within limited space. Imposing additional standardized panels would further constrain label design 
and potentially compromise product identity. 
 
In this context, electronic labelling offers a practical and effective solution for communicating nutritional 
information to consumers, particularly in the case of wine. Digital tools such as QR codes printed on the bottle 
enable producers to provide detailed, accurate, and multilingual information in a format that is both accessible 
and adaptable. Consumers can instantly access this content using their smartphones, allowing for a more 
informative experience without compromising the visual integrity or cultural identity of the label. 
For EU wine exporters to the United States, electronic labelling significantly reduces the logistical and financial 
burden associated with traditional on-label disclosures. It allows updates to be made without reprinting labels—
an essential advantage in a sector in which 99% of companies in the EU are micro, small, or medium -sized 
enterprises. 
 
Digital labelling also supports broader policy objectives, including sustainability and accessibility. It reduces 
packaging waste, enables real -time updates, and facilitates access to product information for persons with 
disabilities. It also responds to evolving consumer expectations for digital transparency and allows producers to 
share additional context, such as production methods or responsible consumption messages, without 
compromising essential label elements. 
 
This approach is already established:  
- In the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2021/2117  permits wine and aromati zed wine products  to 
disclose, under certain conditions, mandatory nutritional and ingredient information electronically. 
- Codex Guidelines on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling (CXG 105-2024) 
also consider that mandatory information particulars could be provided to consumers using technology 
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. 
 
CEEV requests the TTB to recogni ze electronic labelling as a valid means of compliance for wine Serving Facts. 
Such recognition would appropriately consider wine and wine production specificities, promote regulatory 
coherence between major wine -producing regions and facilitate smoother trade flows while supporting 
informed consumer choice. 
 
2. Serving Facts – title, content and tolerance 
Since their introduction in 2013, the existing voluntary requirements for providing nutritional information have 
used the heading “Serving Facts”.  For consistency reasons, CEEV believes that this heading shall not be replaced 
with the title “Alcohol Facts”  as proposed in NPRM 237.  
 
Concerning the content of the Serving Facts, CEEV welcomes the fact that TTB is proposing a content of a 
nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what is required for other food 
products.  
 
CEEV welcomes the proposed 20% tolerance level proposed by the TTB for nutritional declaration as it will allow 
the use of typical values for the nutrition declaration.  
  
Finally, CEEV seeks assurance that, considering the proposed tolerance and the minimal presence of fats and  
 
 
proteins in wine, producers will be permitted either to list these components as “0 grams” thereby avoiding 
the expense of laboratory analysis for these two substances. CEEV also suggest TTB to authorize operators to 
include a single statement such as “Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the 
Statement instead of the “0 grams” indication on the table. 
 
3. Alcohol content statement  
CEEV supports the communication of alcohol content for all alcoholic beverages.  
CEEV requests the TTB not to require alcohol content to be expressed in fluid ounces per serving, in order to 
prevent consumer confusion and support harmonization with international wine labeling practices. Both 
national wine laws and international standar ds, such as those of the OIV, states that alcohol content be 
communicated as ABV. Consumers are accustomed to this format across global wine markets and can readily 
interpret the information provided. 
 
4. Implementation period 
CEEV is in favor of the planned five-year phase-in period as an appropriate timing to allow wine companies to 
adapt to the new rules. 
 
5. Certificate of Label Approval applications 
Considering the variability of wine,  CEEV is in favor of the proposed exemption from requiring new COLA when 
the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required Serving Facts statement.

the TTB's proposed regulation on Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
Scantrust 
Scantrust specializes in digital product information solutions, particularly for wine, 
aromatized wine, and spirits. The U-label by Scantrust platform was specifically designed to 
provide economic operators with a reliable and fully compliant solution to meet the latest 
EU requirements on ingredient and nutritional labeling (Regulation (EU) 2021/2117). 
European wine and spirits associations support our solution and assist our teams with 
regulatory monitoring. This partnership ensures full compliance for our clients in meeting 
European and national labeling requirements for wine and spirits. 
Scantrust has also expanded its expertise in traceability and anti-counterfeiting systems. 
Our mission is to facilitate access to clear, complete, and reliable information for all 
consumers, especially in highly regulated sectors such as wine, spirits, food, cosmetics, 
chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 
Purpose 
This contribution aims to support the authorization of digital labeling (e.g., via QR codes or 
digital links) as an acceptable alternative or complement to physical labeling under the 
TTB’s proposed regulations for alcoholic beverage labeling. 
We believe that the digital solution is fully aligned with the TTB's goals to: 
● Increase product transparency and information to consumers, 
● Provide access to reliable, up-to-date, comprehensive information that 
adapts to regulatory changes (including international ones), 
● Enhance consumer choice, 
● Harmonize labeling standards 
Functional and Economic Benefits of Digital Labeling 
1) Regulatory compliance 
Digital labeling ensures compliance with labeling regulations across different 
countries and/or regions of the world and allows adapting products already present 
on the market to new regulations. As a concrete example of this, when Italy and 
Spain have enforced, in 2023 and 2025 respectively, new labeling regulations requiring all products to show clear packaging sorting and recycling instructions, 
users of the U-label by Scantrust solution were able to add these new requirements 
to their digital labels, including to their already existing labels, and show this new 
content whenever the QR code is scanned in Italy or in Spain specifically. Reprinting 
of physical labeling elements was not necessary due to the dynamic nature of the 
content served and accessed with a QR code printed on labels. 
More generally speaking, users of the U-label by Scantrust solution benefit from 
strong expertise and guidance on how to be compliant with the different labeling 
regulations (both existing and future), how to present the information to ensure full 
compliance, etc. thanks to our partnership with the European wine and spirits 
associations. The acceptance of delivery of mandatory particulars by way of digital 
means as permitted by regulation has been successful in terms of implementation 
and positive sentiment. There is a strong argument for a similar approach and 
regulatory support by the TTB.   
2) Instant data updates 
Digital labels allow real-time updates of information such as nutrition declaration 
and ingredients list without having to reprint labels or recall products. This also 
means that producers can instantly correct any mistake or inaccuracy in a digital 
label, at no cost, and with minimum effort. Correcting a mistake on physical labels 
typically entails a problematic and costly process. 
Process-wise, labels with QR codes can be printed even before the content of the 
bottle is finalized (i.e. at any stage of the production process, even before the final 
ingredient list and nutritional values are known), which, in the case of wine and 
aromatized wine products, is often necessary. Unlike other products, wine is not 
made according to a fixed recipe. Its nutritional content depends on many factors 
and evolves all along the production and maturation processes, meaning that its 
final nutritional facts are not known until it is bottled. Thanks to digital labeling, 
producers can anticipate the labeling process by printing their labels in advance, 
then simply updating the digital label content with accurate information when the 
bottles are marketed – or at any point afterwards. 
3) Cost reduction and efficiency 
A single QR code can dynamically direct consumers to specific content based on 
their location and local regulations. This reduces complexity and printing costs for 
producers, especially those exporting to multiple, disparate markets. 
 
4) Extended and enriched information 
Digital platforms mean that provision of mandatory or ancillary product particulars 
are not limited by physical space on a label. More detailed product information can 
be provided: origin, certifications, sustainability, risks, etc. Information can also be 
provided in a more consumer-friendly way. Including all relevant information on the physical back label of a bottle would mean either affixing awkward folded labels or 
reducing the font size to such a minimum that legibility is compromised. None of 
those are concerns with a digital delivery. 
 
5) Multilingual access 
Digital labelling allows producers to provide information in various languages, 
thanks to integrated standardized translation, ensuring that consumers can access 
accurate information in their preferred language. This feature facilitates 
international market access for U.S. wine producers that are just as concerned with 
providing their customers with all relevant product details as they are with being in 
compliance with local regulatory frameworks.  
 
6) Accessibility and inclusiveness 
QR codes, when combined with mobile accessibility features (screen readers, voice 
assistants, AQR), provide improved access for blind or visually impaired users, while 
traditional labels fail to effectively meet these users’ needs. 
Legibility of printed labels is a salient challenge too. According to a widely cited 
structured experiment published in 2011, 61% of consumers presented with some 
sample food labels reported that nutrition information was too small to read. This 
seems consistent with what we know about near-vision changes with age. 
Systematic reviews estimate that 83-89% of US adults over 45 years old have 
presbyopia (PubMed), meaning they have difficulty reading small letters at near 
distances without correction. 
For consumers with serious vision impairment, physical labels are often totally 
unusable. In the US alone, this concerns millions of people: about 7 million people (6 
million with vision loss and 1 million blind), according to CDC’s Vision and Eye 
Health Surveillance System). For these consumers, digital labeling is an opportunity 
to access product information, thanks to screen readers, zoom, high contrast, and 
text-to-speech functionalities. 
On the Issue of Universal Access 
Smartphone penetration currently exceeds 85% in developed countries such as the 
United States. 
According to Pew Research Center’s latest Mobile Fact Sheet published in 2024, 
91% of US adults own a smartphone. Even within lower-income households (below 
$30,000), a large majority of adults (79%) own a smartphone, with 28% of them 
relying on their device for internet access as opposed to a desktop with home 
broadband access. A recent AARP survey, updated in November 2024, reports that nine out of ten 
Americans own a smartphone with 89% of Americans over 50 owning a 
smartphone, compared to 90% among those aged 18-49. 
The recommendation is that digital labels are accessed using QR codes as they do 
not require any specific app—only the camera function or listing of a URL is needed. 
Physical label content may be damaged or unreadable, making digital tools an 
equivalent or even superior alternative. 
Consistency with international (EU) regulation 
Authorizing digital labeling in the US would align with the European Union’s 
regulatory approach. Since December 2023, the EU requires the disclosure of 
nutritional values and ingredients for wine and aromatized wine marketed in the EU 
and explicitly allows this to be done through digital labels  using QR codes. Aligning 
the TTB approach with the EU would provide a harmonized and practical solution 
for export-oriented producers, while significantly reducing compliance costs. Such 
regulatory harmonization would support international trade, avoid redundant 
labeling, lower costs for operators, and foster cooperation between major markets. 
It would also improve predictability for businesses operating in both the U.S. and

Conclusion 
Digital labeling is a preferred alternative to a strict physical label only policy 
regarding delivery of mandatory particulars for wine and alcohol products. It 
ensures immediate, persistent, and universal access to information, which is 
particularly beneficial for products subject to multiple regulations, and for small-
scale and/or export-oriented producers. 
Data consistently shows high and rising smartphone access in the United States, 
even among older and lower-income adults, seriously undermining the critique that 
digital information is not readily available to all. Physical labeling limitations are 
also increasingly acknowledged, i.e. with widespread near-vision and sight 
impairments that make small prints hard – or impossible – to read and the risk of 
label damage that contributes to illegibility or information loss.  
For all the above, we kindly request TTB to recognize digital labeling as a valid 
means of regulatory compliance for wine and alcohol labeling. Digital labels offer 
precision, cost-effectiveness, inclusivity, and adaptability—key principles of modern 
regulation.

Re: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages

Dear Ms. Greenberg:

Family Winemakers of California is a trade association which advocates for predominately small, family-owned wineries in California – nearly all of whom produce less than 5,000 cases/year.

Celebrating our 35th anniversary this year, our members continue to contribute to the agricultural strength and economies of numerous California communities.

Wine labels currently contain many facts. Among these are: Producer identification, class and type of wine, net contents, sulfite declaration, and other “mandatory” information. If we

include the information that “may” be on a wine label - it becomes evident that space available for additional information would be at a premium – if any space actually remained. Additional information should only be mandatory if it serves a necessary benefit for the consumer. Most of our members rely on direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, which doesn’t require a UPC code.

Even without the UPC code, label space is crowded. QR codes are a consideration, but they are not part of the current proposal in the notice.

QR codes are in common use today and can deliver important information to consumers. Some wineries today have already adopted the use of QR codes to deliver information about their wines - such as specific production methods used, and origin of the wines themselves. If the

TTB adopts this proposal and makes it mandatory, it should allow the information to be delivered via QR code. Further, to maintain consistency in current label format, it should

continue to use the term “Serving Facts” which accurately describes the proposed information.

Family Winemakers of California appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation and is happy to answer any questions you may have about our comments.

FIVS Response to the U.S. Federal Register Notice Regarding Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labelling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
14 August 2025 
 
FIVS appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 
Bureau’s (TTB) Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements.  
FIVS is the international federation for the global wine and associated sectors, advocating for an 
operating environment free from unnecessary and distortive trade barriers. Our membership 
comprises 50 leading wine companies and trade associations from 19 countries, collectively 
accounting for more than 85% of global wine production. 
To support international wine trade and regulatory coherence, FIVS has published a number of 
good regulatory practice frameworks, including: 
1. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2013) 
2. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2016) 
3. Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) (2025) 
These documents address a wide range of regulatory issues and have been welcomed by 
governments as a basis for more efficient and coherent policy, facilitating trade and ensuring 
consumer protection. 
In light of the current consultation, we are pleased to share the FIVS Good Regulatory Principles 
for Electronic Labelling, which outline best practices for using digital tools to communicate both 
mandatory and voluntary labelling information. We respectfully urge TTB to consider the 
consumer benefits and efficiencies offered by e -labelling when evaluating new labelling 
requirements. 
Wine has many unique characteristics that derive from the fact that it is not a recipe product, it is 
an agricultural product grown and produced with each annual vintage having unique impacts on 
the finished pro duct. These characteristics create special challenges for wine producers when 
considering new labelling requirements such as the ones proposed in No. 237. Technologies such 
as QR codes enable producers to manage the variations of each annual harvest (and its impact 
on nutritional content) while providing accurate, up-to-date information with limited disruption to 
their operations . The vast majority of global wine producers  are small and medium sized 
companies and this approach is particularly valuable in helping to reduce compliance costs 
without compromising consumer access to information. 
In the European Union, wine producers are already permitted to communicate certain mandatory 
information—such as ingredients and nutritional data —via QR codes. FIVS supports a balanced 
approach, recognizing that some mandatory information (e.g., allergen w arnings) should remain on the physical label. E -labelling is not a replacement but a complement to physical labels, 
enhancing consumer understanding and choice through modern, accessible means. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) 
14 March 2025 
The following sets forth principles and best practices policymakers should consider when 
allowing the use of electronic means for the presentation of voluntary and mandatory labelling 
information to consumers.   
These principles and best practices build on two previous sets of FIVS ’ “
Principles to Enhance 
Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine ” and reflect growing trends i n the voluntary or 
mandatory disclosure of information via electronic means beyond what is included on the 
physical wine label.  For the purposes of this document, “e-labelling”, “digital means” or “digital 
presentation” refer to  the voluntary or mandatory 1 disclosure of information via electronic 
means such as using a scannable code that creates a bridge from the physical label to the e-
label. 
Use of technology to provide for  the digital presentation of some mandatory information is an 
emerging area particularly relevant to wine producers. Wine is not a recipe or formula product.  
In contrast with other food products, the ingredients and related nutritional values in wine can 
vary from vintage to vintage due to variations in climate and grape growing conditions.  In some 
cases, ﬁnal ingredients may not be known until just before bottling whereas the physical label is 
designed and typically printed months in advance of bottling due to the regulatory nature of key 
information on wine labels and label pre -approvals required in some markets .  The use of e-
labels for the digital presentation of ingredients and nutrition information permits the ﬂexibility 
needed while still enabling product accuracy.   
 
However, the use of e-labels should not be restricted only to this speciﬁc and narrow use.  
Consumers want more product information tha n can reasonably ﬁ t on physical labels and a 
single QR code can serve multiple purposes . In some jurisdictions, QR codes have already 
replaced barcodes at the retail level
2 and technology exists for the use of a single QR code to 
transmit different information depending on the type of scanner used.   
 
Here are just a few examples of the type of information currently accessible via a single QR code 
as well as potential future uses.  
 
• Consumers - voluntary product details, sustainability information, product recalls, and 
more. 
• Retailers - point of sale pricing, stocking, and inventory information. 
• Government Officials - mandatory regulatory information, recycling information, and 
export documentation.  
 
 
1 For the purposes of this document, mandatory refers to disclosures that regulations require.

QR codes are the most common digital means being used at this time to connect to an e-label.  
While future advancements in technology may lead to replacement s for QR code s, these  
principles will still apply to the use of such replacements. 
1. Use of e -labelling to provide information to wine consumers : 
Governments should permit the use of e- labelling to provide 
information to consumers.   
Recent work in both Codex Alimentarius3 and the International Organi sation of Vine  and Wine 
(OIV) 4  illustrates the growing trend of the use of e-labels to provide some mandatory information 
for food products, including wine. The following are just a few of the reasons that support the ir 
use: 
• Rapidly increasing global penetration of smartphones; 
• Widespread and growing consumer use of QR codes to access information; 
• Consumer demand for more product transparency; 
• Reduced waste consistent with wine industry sustainability goals as the use of e -labels 
reduces label re-prints; 
• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired; and 
• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer - in real time - which is 
not possible using physical labels.  
2. Presentation of certain mandatory information  using digital 
means: Governments should  allow the presentation of certain 
mandatory information via e-labels.     
The European Union (EU) recently took this approach for ingredient and nutrition labelling of 
wine and aromatized wine products5 as did Italy6 and Spain7 for recycling information8 and other 
countries are assessing the introduction of their use in national legislation.

of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)). 
4 The recently updated “OIV International Standard for Labelling of Wines-e-label, nutrient declaration, information 
about ingredients” (amended by resolution ECO DROCON 20-6 76) incorporates many of the FIVS principles. Note 
especially the ability to use a language -free modality: “The direct link to the e -label indicated on the label may be 
clearly identiﬁed through language free presentation modalities, a pictogram or a symbol easily visible and clear to 
understand by consumers.”

The range of possible uses of QR codes to present some information digitally is expected to 
expand over time. Governments should remain flexible and open to allowing digital presentation 
of certain mandatory information as appropriate.    
The same general principles of food labelling regulation such as legibility, truthfulness, and 
accuracy should apply whe ther mandatory information is presented on a physical label or via 
digital means.  
These principles recognize that some mandatory information will  always be on the physical 
label, such as for allergens. A digital label does not replace, but rather supplements, a physical 
label. 
3. Use of QR codes to communicate other, voluntary information: 
Governments should  permit additional, voluntary information to 
be presented via e-labels.   
The same QR code that links to mandatory information should also be permitted to link to 
voluntary information, p rovided that  it is presented separately and distinctly from the 
mandatory information.  
It may be appropriate to allow producers to include a link on the e -label at the end of the 
mandatory information inviting consumers to “click here” should  they desire access to 
additional voluntary information.   
4. The number  of QR codes on a given label should be 
minimized: Governments should permit a single QR code on a 
wine label to serve more than one purpose.  
A single QR code has nearly unlimited uses. 
In some jurisdictions, a single QR code is already being used for product pricing at the point of 
sale, to convey mandatory EU nutrition and ingredient requirements for wine, and to 
communicate EU Member State specific recycling requirements. 
In the United States, many food and beverage companies use a single QR code on a voluntary 
basis to provide information about ingredients, nutrition, and how to properly recycle the 
product based on the consumer’s location

Allowing a single QR code for voluntary and mandatory purposes will maximize its benefit and 
will avoid confusion about which QR code to scan for additional information. 
5. Acceptance of standalone QR codes to c onvey information: 
Governments should refrain from requiring additional text on the 
physical label to identify the information accessible via the QR 
code. 
QR Codes provide for a language -free system of conveying important information and 
consumers are comfortable scanning the codes to access that information.    
Using terms next to the QR code to identify the information on the e-label should be avoided  
because: 
• As the use of QR codes expands , the number of possible terms and languages 
needed to correctly identify the content will proliferate. 
• Text, or other design elements, too close or within the QR code can corrupt the code 
risking its readability10 
If it is deemed essential to identify the mandatory information accessible via the QR code , a 
globally recognized, language-free symbol or pictogram should be utilized.  However, this must 
not interfere with the ability to successfully scan the code. 
6. Expiration of e -labels: When mandatory information is 
provided via an e -label, governments should not require that 
the information remain accessible longer than the wine is 
ordinarily intended for consumption.  
Codex Alimentarius recently agreed to “Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food 
Information in Food Labelling11 that address the timeframe for which producers are expected to 
ensure that information that is accessed via QR codes remains available.  The Guidelines apply 
to pre-packaged foods, including wine.  
Governments are requested to refer to the Guidelines rather than implementing new or 
divergent requirements .  H owever, consideration should be given to adapting them in the 
 
10 ISO/IEC 18004:2024(en), Information technology — Automatic identiﬁcation and data capture techniques — QR 
code bar code symbology speciﬁcation- S ee 5.3.8 “Quiet Zone” that designates the clear space needed 
surrounding the QR code to separate it from nearby design elements or markings to ensure the QR codes 
readability.

Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)).

context of long shelf-life products such as wine to focus on the time period for which the product 
is ordinarily intended for consumption. 
The final Guidelines at section 7.5 state, “Where mandatory food information is solely provided 
using technology, the food information shall be available for at least the period, established 
under intended conditions of distribution, storage, retail and use, that the food would remain 
safe and suit able for sale, consumption or use. For pre- packaged food that is labelled with a 
use-by date or expiration date, this means for at least the period up to and including this date.” 
7. E-labels should comply with applicable data  privacy laws:   
In formulating regulations for the e-labelling of food products, 
governments should take fully into consideration any existing 
and applicable data privacy laws. 
Many countries, including those that allow the use of e-labe ls, have data privacy laws in place 
to protect consumer data or prohibit its collection without affirmative consent. Thus, 
governments should remain mindful of these laws to avoid duplication, contradiction, or overly 
restrictive rules specific to e-labelling.   
8. Harmonized approach: Governments should work towards a 
harmonized international understanding concerning the types of 
information that must appear on the physical label of a wine bottle 
and that which may appear on an e-label.   
Wine is traded all around the world and e-labelling technology is already being used in multiple 
markets.   
In order to facilitate international trade, g overnments are requested to remain flexible in their 
approach and to consider the best practices already in place in key wine producing markets 
before developing regulations in this area.

While we recognize TTB's intent to enhance consumer transparency, this proposal overlooks the disproportionately high and ongoing costs of compliance, particularly the extensive testing requirements mandated to validate nutrient contents as outlined in the official TTB guidance on approved testing methods (TTB Guidance Procedure 2020-1). According to accredited laboratory services (e.g., ETS Laboratories), the analyses required for each nutrient parameter cost hundreds of dollars per label annually. For small, family-owned wineries operating on extremely tight margins, these recurring costs represent an unsustainable financial burden. Unlike other industries, alcoholic beverage producers face compounded compliance pressures due to a regulatory environment spanning both TTB and FDA jurisdictions. This dual compliance further multiplies costs and administrative complexity, invariably impacting label design, production timelines, and consumer pricing. The economic consequences extend beyond wineries themselves. Our rural communities depend on the health of these agricultural enterprises. Tourism, hospitality, restaurants, and supplementary agritourism venues rely heavily on winery-generated commerce. Imposing untenable testing and labeling costs risks closing or downsizing many small wineries, dealing a devastating blow to these interconnected local economies. Additionally, the proposal's emphasis on serving size distinctions distracts from the core issue. The priority should be on the financial viability and practical impact on small producers, not on hypothetical consumer confusion over serving sizes or label formatting. We urge TTB to reevaluate this proposal with a focus on balanced regulatory scope, evidence-based thresholds, and the real-world economics of small and rural producers. Any mandate should reasonably weigh costs against public health benefits and incorporate flexibility to prevent undue hardship on the very communities and businesses that sustain the American wine industry.

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  
(RIN 1513–AC93) 
 
Dear Administrator Ryan: 
 
On behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I 
appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (ATTB) 
proposed rule entitled “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages” (RIN 1513–AC93). We commend the ATTB for its thorough review and recognizing the 
importance of transparency for consumers on serving size and ingredient contents. As the body of 
scientific evidence grows on the impact of alcohol on health conditions such as cancer, it is imperative to 
make this information available in an easy to comprehend format.  
 
Since 2013, alcohol companies have printed versions of a facts label on some of their products. This 
voluntary action lacks uniform guidance, visuals, content, or graphic depictions, and often uses terms like 
“no added sugar” or “gluten free.” These could be interpreted as suggesting that alcoholic beverages have 
nutritional value. The AMA commends the ATTB for promulgating rules with mandatory label 
requirements that provide consumers with consistent information across products. 
 
The AMA has long-standing policies on the impact of alcohol consumption on health and restrictions on 
marketing alcohol to adolescents. Provisions in this rule align with AMA’s initiatives to improve 
consumer access to reliable health information. The AMA generally supports many of the proposals in 
this rule and offers some additional recommendations that would further advance consumer protections 
when it comes to consuming alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) products, including requiring that alcohol fact 
statements include a warning about the link between alcohol and cancer, as outlined in greater detail 
below.  
 
Nutritional Information  
 
The AMA agrees with the ATTB’s proposed mandatory requirement of a uniform alcohol facts 
label that includes a standard set of information across all alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. It 
is important for consumers to understand the health impacts of these beverages and be able to compare 
beverage choices.  
 
The AMA supports ATTB’s proposal that mandatory nutrient information statement on labels must 
include the following information: serving size, servings per container, alcohol content as a percentage of The Honorable Mary G. Ryan 
August 14, 2025 
Page 2 
 
 
  
alcohol by volume and per serving size, calories per serving, and carbohydrates and fat per serving. This 
nutrient information will provide consumers with valuable information about how the products they are 
consuming will impact their diet and overall health, just as the nutritional facts label does with food 
products. This is especially important as the selection of alcoholic beverages marketed to consumers has 
evolved in recent years to include products that are high in added sugars and other additives. For example, 
ready-to drink cocktails are among the fastest growing category of spirits, with sales revenue in the U.S. 
growing by 26.8 percent from 2022 to 2023.1   
 
The ATTB proposes allowing sugar content statements as an optional element and does not propose to 
include sodium or cholesterol because they are generally present in small amounts in alcoholic beverages. 
The AMA believes that sugars, sodium, and cholesterol should be mandatory elements on the 
alcohol facts label. To align the alcohol facts label with the nutrition facts label and provide consumers 
with essential and comprehensive information, sugars, including those that are added, are an essential 
component. Sugars contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and can exacerbate 
existing CVD. Alcoholic beverages can also contain high levels of carbohydrates and sodium. For 
consumers to successfully limit these nutrients, as recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines, this 
information must be accessible on labels.  
 
The AMA supports consistent labeling requirements for “non-alcoholic” or “zero proof” beverages 
that are manufactured, packaged, or marketed in a manner similar to alcoholic beverages. 
Requiring that these products have the same alcohol facts labeling requirements will contribute to 
increased consumer awareness about the dietary impact of these products, which are increasingly 
becoming a popular replacement for alcohol products.1 Non-alcoholic beverages are also attractive to 
adolescents when marketed as an alternative to alcohol with the same taste.2 This labeling consistency is 
important for adolescents to build good habits comparing this type of nutrition information. 
 
The ATTB proposes to allow for the optional presentation of Alcohol Facts panels in a dual-column 
format in which the first column would provide the information for the standard reference serving size, 
while the second column would provide information about the contents of the entire container. The AMA 
believes there would be value in making this mandatory. The dual-column format would provide 
important contextual information and ensure that consumers would be familiar with this format as it 
would be consistent with nutrition facts label requirements.  
 
Title and Display 
 
The ATTB is considering both “Serving Facts” and “Alcohol Facts” as options for the title of the label. 
The AMA recommends that the ATTB use the “Alcohol Facts” title. This title uses the same naming 
convention as the Nutrition Facts label. ATTB could take advantage of existing consumer awareness 
about the use and benefit of such labels by adapting the education and dissemination strategies deployed 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and public health groups including the AMA.3

The AMA understands that the ATTB considered allowing the Alcohol Facts panel to be distributed by 
electronic means that would allow for limiting the information printed on the product label. The AMA 
recommends that the ATTB not allow this form of distribution at the expense of complete and 
thorough information on the product itself. While QR codes and websites can be a useful way to 
provide more detailed nutritional information than traditional labels, research suggests that many 
consumers may not actively use them—due to factors such as convenience, usability, perceived value, 
and online accessibility.4,5 The AMA supports the ATTB’s decision to instead require that this 
information be directly displayed on the product label itself. 
 
To support greater consumer comprehension of the purpose of an alcohol facts label, the AMA 
recommends the use of a panel as opposed to linear format. Panel-style ingredient labels are 
consistently easier for consumers to read and understand, regardless of the type of product, due to their 
structured and standardized layout6 and consumers are already familiar with this format due to the 
nutrition facts label. 
 
ATTB is proposing that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements mirror existing 
type size requirements for mandatory information in the wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverage 
regulations. The AMA supports evidence-based minimum type size requirements to ensure the 
information is presented in a clear, legible format to consumers. The AMA also calls for alcohol 
labeling presented with sufficient prominence, legibility, and design features, such as minimum font size, 
and color contrast, and optional pictorial elements, to enhance readability and support informed decision-
making across populations. To this end, the AMA recommends that the ATTB utilize a multifaceted 
qualitative evaluation process including consumer focus groups to understand which design 
elements are most effective at relaying key information on alcohol beverages. Upon completion of 
this evaluative process, the ATTB should release guidance/examples and possible rulemaking with 
additional requirements based on these findings, such as required color schemes and/or pictorial elements. 
The FDA employed this process in the creation of final regulations for front-of-package nutrition labeling 
and tobacco warning labels. Both were shaped by rigorous, evidence-based research, including consumer 
focus groups, to ensure clear and effective health communication. The FDA relied on this body of 
research to inform its regulations and guidance that empower consumers to make informed decisions and 
advance population health outcomes.  
 
Compliance Date 
 
CMS proposes a compliance deadline of five years from the date of publication in the Federal Register. 
While the AMA understands the desire to allow a reasonable runway, particularly for small 
manufacturers, to come into compliance, we believe five years is an unnecessarily long time and would 
recommend an alternative deadline of two or three years to come into compliance with the rule, which we 
believe would provide more than adequate time for suppliers to come into compliance. In any case, ATTB 
should not finalize a deadline of any longer than five years.  
 
Additional Recommendations 
 
The AMA supports the addition of the following warning statement: “There is no safe amount of 
alcohol consumption, and consuming alcohol in any amount increases the risk of cancer and other

illnesses.” This statement is supported by The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of 
Underage Drinking’s Alcohol Intake and Health draft report and The National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine’s Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health report. These reports were 
assigned by the Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as the evidence 
base needed to develop alcohol consumption recommendations in the final 2025 guidelines.7,8 
Observational and meta-analysis reviews have all confirmed the known link between alcohol 
consumption and cancers.9,10 Despite additional evidence presented in the U.S. Surgeon General’s 
Advisory on Alcohol and Cancer Risk, less than half of U.S. adults are aware of the link between alcohol 
use and cancer.11,12 Ideally, this warning statement would be placed on the front of package label. In 
addition to package labeling, the AMA recommends clear, evidence-based point-of-sale warning signage 
in physical and digital retail environments. 
 
Lastly, the AMA strongly supports ongoing research and evaluation into the impact of alcohol warning 
labels on consumer knowledge and behavior, health outcomes, and alcohol sales patterns, particularly 
across sub-populations, and that alcohol labeling standards be updated based on the latest in evolving 
evidence about what consumer education strategies are most effective.  
 
In Conclusion 
 
Overall, the AMA strongly supports the creation of an alcohol facts statement, which will lead to greater 
consumer understanding about the associated dietary and health impacts of consuming alcoholic products. 
We welcome further opportunities to collaborate with the ATTB as it works towards finalization and 
implementation of these new requirements which will help empower Americans to more easily compare 
products and make well-informed decisions. Please reach out to me directly at 312-464-5288 or

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) respectfully submits the following 
comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rule on 
alcohol facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. CSPI is a 
non-profit consumer education and advocacy organization that has worked since 1971 to 
improve the public’s health through better nutrition and safer food. CSPI publishes Nutrition 
Action and is supported by the subscribers to Nutrition Action, individual donors, and foundation 
grants. CSPI is an independent organization that does not accept any corporate donations. 
 
Overall, we support this rule as a major step forward for transparency on alcoholic beverages that 
will allow consumers to make more informed choices about their alcohol purchases and TTB 
should move swiftly to finalize this rule. However, consumers need more information about 
nutrition and alcohol content beyond what has been proposed.  
 
Background 
 
CSPI has a long history of advocating for greater transparency on alcohol and has called for 
alcohol content and nutrition information labeling for over two decades. In 2003, CSPI, the 
National Consumers League (NCL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and 66 other 
health and consumer organizations filed a citizen petition calling on TTB’s predecessor to 
require a standardized “Alcohol Facts” label (including percent alcohol by volume (%ABV), 
serving size, amount of alcohol per serving, servings per container, calories, ingredients, and the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) advice on moderate drinking) on all beer, wine, and 
distilled spirits.
1 In 2005, TTB requested public comments on alcohol labeling,2 and in 2007, 
TTB issued proposed rules for mandatory “Serving Facts,”3 but these rules were never finalized. 
Instead, in 2013, TTB published a ruling allowing voluntary nutrition and alcohol content 
labeling.
4 In October 2022, CSPI, NCL, and CFA filed a lawsuit demanding a long-overdue 
response to our 19-year-old citizen petition.5  
 
The proposed rule, published by TTB in January 2025, would require an “Alcohol Facts” 
statement to be present on all TTB-regulated alcoholic products. The proposed “Alcohol Facts” 
panel includes “alcohol content expressed both as a percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of calories, and the number, in grams, of 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”
6 It also allows for a sugar content statement as an 
optional aspect of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. The rule establishes “tolerance ranges” for each    
 
2 
 
“Alcohol Facts” panel element, including updates to %ABV tolerance ranges and allows the 
“Alcohol Facts” statement to be provided in either block or linear format and in either a vertical 
or horizontal position. Additionally, it sets forth serving size reference amounts, some additional 
formatting requirements/options, including optional dual-column labeling. The rule specifies that 
this information must appear on-package and that provision of this information solely via QR 
code is not allowed. 
Position Summary 
 
In this comment, we convey the following main points:  
• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include serving size, servings per 
container, %ABV, and calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in grams. The disclosure 
should also include total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, 
sodium in milligrams, percent Daily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, 
number of standard drinks per container (instead of the proposed number of fluid ounces 
of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), the conversion between standard drinks and fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and specific, actionable moderate drinking advice (see, e.g., 
Figure 1 below). We refer to the above elements as: CSPI’s Proposed Alcohol “Serving 
Facts” Label. 
• We agree with the proposed serving size reference amounts and the proposal that 
containers with less than 200% of a single serving should be labeled as a single serving.  
• We disagree with the decision to make dual-column labeling voluntary. Dual-column 
labeling should be mandatory to further assist consumers in understanding the contents of 
alcohol products they purchase. 
• We disagree with the proposed 5-year compliance period. TTB should adopt a shorter 
compliance period of 3.5 years, as this would strike a better balance between providing 
consumers with information they require and minimizing cost to industry. 
• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure should be required to appear on-package 
and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this 
would place a barrier between consumers and this vital information and specifically 
disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology 
(e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land).

Our detailed comments are as follows:  
 
1) Improving alcohol labeling is a commonsense approach for promoting transparency, 
health, and safety. 
 
Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various harms including injuries,
7 motor vehicle 
accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.8 Alcohol is also calorie-
dense and on average accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.9 Many alcoholic 
beverages also contain carbohydrates, sugars, and other nutrients to limit. All other products we 
consume have basic nutrient, calorie, food allergen, and ingredients information.  
 
Alcohol content labeling is a simple tool that increases consumer awareness of the contents of 
alcoholic beverages
10 and could potentially impact drinking behavior.11 Many alcohol industry 
members are willing and able to label their products, as evidenced by the wide adoption of the 
Brewers’ Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which has resulted in 95% of the beer (by volume) of 
the top beer brands voluntarily providing nutrition information on their labels.12 
 
Recent polling shows that the majority of consumers want access to alcohol content and nutrition 
information and would find it helpful when making purchasing decisions about alcoholic 
beverages.13 In March 2024, Big Village’s CARAVAN U.S. Online Omnibus Survey 
(commissioned by CSPI) was administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, 
demographically balanced to represent the U.S. Census on age, sex, geographical region, race, 
and ethnicity. Of the 1,924 respondents, 1,509 (78%) reported consuming a drink containing 
alcohol in the past year. Of those who reported consuming at least one drink in the past year, a 
majority said they either strongly support or somewhat support policies to require alcohol 
content (77%), serving size (67%), calorie content (66%), and nutritional content (64%) 
information on alcohol labels. Arming consumers with this additional information would help 
them make comparisons between products and could increase competition in the marketplace. 
 
Manufacturers are currently allowed to provide alcohol content and nutrition information on a 
voluntary basis, but uptake is low and uneven across products. CSPI conducted an analysis, 
published in 2023, of available labels from the top 150 beer brands (of which 65 brands had 
labels available) and top 100 wine brands (of which 67 brands had labels available) by 2020 
sales volume. The analysis found that the statement of average analysis, which contains calories, 
carbohydrates, protein, and fat, was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.
14 The 
voluntary “Alcohol Facts” label, which includes %ABV, serving size, servings per container, and 
per-serving and per-container information about fluid ounces of alcohol, was present on only 2% 
of beer and 0% of wine labels. Even when this information was present, on most labels it was 
presented in formatting that poses a challenge to consumers, such as vertical layout (62%), 
continuous format (95%), and use of all uppercase letters and a crowded layout (60%).  
 
Below, we provide input on selected questions posed by TTB in its proposed rule, with an 
emphasis on the importance of mandatory, comprehensive, on-package labeling.

2) “Serving Facts” is the preferable title for the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether the title “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts” best describes 
the information provided. While either option is acceptable, “Serving Facts” is preferable, as it 
indicates that it is providing per-serving information and has the added benefit of implying that 
the information may not just be about the alcohol content, but about other ingredients as well. 
This is also aligned with how consumers are accustomed to finding this information on alcohol 
products, as the voluntary statement of average analysis is titled “Serving Facts.”  
 
3) The proposed serving size reference amounts are appropriate. 
 
The proposed “Alcohol Facts” panel bases serving size on the serving sizes provided in the TTB 
Ruling 2013-2 (see Figure 3).
4 TTB is soliciting feedback on the appropriateness of these 
serving size reference amounts compared to those in a previous ruling (TTB ruling 2004-1). We 
agree that these reference amounts are appropriate. However, to avoid consumer confusion they 
must be combined with the requirement, which TTB has proposed, that containers with up to 
200% of a serving be labeled as a single serving, plus mandatory dual-column labeling for 
containers with up to 500% of a single serving (TTB has proposed optional dual column 
labeling) (see section 6 below). These three things combined will facilitate optimal consumer 
understanding of the content of each product.  
 
Figure 3. Serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 
 
Source: TTB Ruling 2013-2: Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/2013 -2.pdf 
 
The serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 are appropriate because they account for the 
fact that alcoholic beverages come in a wide variety of strengths, even across alcohol types. An 
earlier 2004 ruling by TTB, which set forth serving sizes of 1.5 fluid ounces for distilled spirits, 
5 fluid ounces for wines, and 12 fluid ounces for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol 
content,15 lacks the nuance needed to account for the wide variety of products on the market. For 
example, under the 2004 rule, both unfortified wine and fortified wines would have a 5 ounce 
serving, despite the fact that fortified wines can contain up to 25% ABV and have an average of 
18% ABV compared to an average of 12% ABV for unfortified wines.16 While unfortified wine 
is typically served in 5-ounce pours, fortified wines are typically served in 3-ounce pours,17 
which better aligns to the 2013 serving sizes. Additionally, as the 2013 ruling points out,4 under 
the 2004 ruling, the serving size for distilled spirits (which are in a canned cocktail) would be 1.5 
ounces regardless of %ABV of the full product. But, unlike pure distilled spirits, canned 
   
 
6 
 
cocktails are commonly consumed in 12-ounce cans and, by nature of being diluted with mixer, 
often have a far lower %ABV. The serving sizes put forth in the 2013 ruling are the better option 
because they account for variations in strength within each alcohol category and generally align 
better with how these beverages are typically consumed (i.e., higher %ABV beverages tend to be 
offered in smaller servings). 
 
One drawback to the 2013 serving sizes, that can be offset by dual-column labeling, is that if a 
consumer fails to notice that a higher %ABV products has a smaller serving size when 
comparing to a lower %ABV product the high %ABV product could appear to be the lower 
calorie option, when in fact it would have more calories if consumed in equal amounts. Because 
the proposed serving sizes are the best option but will not always perfectly align with how 
beverages are consumed, dual-column labeling should be mandatory when a container holds up 
to 500% of a single serving (see section 6).   
 
TTB is also soliciting feedback on making the serving size reference amount equal to an 
alcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, but this does not align with the way in 
which these beverages are typically consumed and would be confusing. For example, unfortified 
wine is usually served in a 5-ounce pour, regardless of %ABV. If the serving size for the Alcohol 
Facts panel were made equal to 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, a 7% ABV wine would have an 8.6-
ounce serving size and a 16% ABV wine would have a 3.8-ounce serving size. Even with 
rounding, this might make it difficult for consumers to estimate nutrition and alcohol serving 
information for the amount that they are actually consuming. 
 
4) Dual-column labeling should be mandatory and containers with less than 200% of a 
serving should be labeled as a single serving. 
 
We agree with the proposed requirement that beverages packaged in containers with less than 
200% of a single serving size reference amount be labeled as a single serving. This will result in 
more containers that are commonly consumed on a single occasion being labeled as a single 
serving. For example, a 16-ounce 4.2% ABV Bud Light
18 can that contains 133% of a 12-ounce 
serving would simply be labeled as one serving. 
 
If the product contains multiple servings, the label should also state the number of servings per 
container and dual-column labeling should be mandatory. The number of standard drinks should 
be listed per serving and per container (see Fig. 3 below). TTB’s proposed rule allows voluntary 
dual-column labeling for containers of up to five servings. This differs from FDA’s dual-column 
labeling approach, which is mandatory and applies to products containing more than two and up 
to three servings per container.19 Mandatory dual-column labeling is important to prevent 
consumer confusion that may arise from basing serving size for alcohol on %ABV. For example, 
in Figure 4, both Guinness beers are in 12-ounce bottles, but the Extra Stout has a 12-ounce 
serving size and the Foreign Extra Stout has a 5-ounce serving size due to its higher %ABV. If 
calorie information is given solely per serving, the Foreign Extra stout would appear to have 
fewer calories, but the dual-column labeling makes it clear that the whole bottle contains more 
calories.

TTB should require dual column labeling on products containing up to 5 servings and allow 
voluntary dual-column labeling on products containing more than 5 servings. Requiring dual-
column labeling on products with up to five servings is important to clearly communicate the 
nutrition and alcohol content on alcoholic beverages that are often consumed in one sitting but 
packaged in non-resealable containers up to 5 servings. For example, “Voodoo Ranger,” an 
imperial IPA of 9% ABV from New Belgium brewery, can be found in 19.2-ounce cans.20 Based 
on the proposed reference serving size of 5 ounces, each can contains approximately 4 servings, 
but it is not resealable.  
 
Dual-column labeling should additionally be voluntary on containers larger than 5 servings, as 
this will allow manufacturers to provide more information to consumers. This may be especially 
useful in rare cases where the manufacturer may have an expectation that more than 5 servings 
are likely to be consumed in a single sitting, such as when an unusually high %ABV beer is sold 
in larger sized cans and bottles. For example, Evil Twin 120 Days Dry Aged Stout is 17.5% 
ABV and sold in pint sized cans.21 With a 2.5-ounce serving size, it has 6.4 servings and is not 
resealable. Optional dual column labeling would be useful on products such as these to further 
inform the consumer.

TTB asks whether consumers might interpret dual-column labeling as a recommendation to drink 
a whole container. A consumer’s decision to consume an entire container may be influenced by 
multiple factors, including the container design, the environment in which the container is 
purchased and consumed, and product marketing. We are not aware of any studies indicating that 
dual-column labeling independently influences consumers’ risk of consuming an entire 
container, and such labeling provides additional information to consumers, which may be useful 
in informing purchasing and consumption decisions. We therefore find no strong rationale for 
preventing this form of labeling as a voluntary practice. Inclusion of additional information, such 
as the number of standard drinks and the footnote with specific, actionable moderate drinking 
guidelines (discussed above), could further prevent this confusion. TTB could also consider 
requiring an additional footnote explaining that the dual-column label does not mean that the 
container is meant to be consumed in one sitting. While such a footnote is not required by FDA, 
overconsumption of alcohol has more severe consequences. 
 
5) Alcohol Content Information 
 
Most adults who drink support mandatory alcohol content labeling and believe this information 
is important for making purchasing decisions. As mentioned above, a poll of U.S. adults who 
drink alcohol found that 77% of respondents support policies to require alcohol content 
information on alcohol labels and 90% indicated that it was at least “somewhat important” when 
making alcohol purchasing decisions (with 39% ranking it as “extremely important”).
13 
Currently, this information is not required on all alcoholic beverages and when present can be 
difficult to find. 
 
Data from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show 
that approximately 9% of adults drank in excess of DGA recommendations.22 A literature review 
found that consumers tend to pour larger drinks when asked to estimate a standard drink, and 
struggle to use %ABV and pour size to estimate their intake.23 Alcohol content information, such 
as standard drinks, can help improve consumer awareness of the amount of alcohol they are 
consuming.10,23 
 
a. Consumers need more information on alcohol content than the proposed 
mandatory statement of fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. 
 
The proposed rule requires a statement of the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in 
the “Alcohol Facts” statement. Under the current labeling system, if a consumer wants to know 
how many standard drinks are in a product, they must use the %ABV to calculate fluid ounces of 
pure ethyl alcohol and then divide by 0.6. Under the proposed labeling system, which would 
require the number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, gets consumers one step closer to the 
information they want. However, fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol will likely not be useful to 
consumers as they are unlikely to know that 0.6 fluid ounces of pure ethanol equals a standard 
drink.23 In addition, even if the conversion is provided, converting this information into standard 
drinks still requires consumers to perform division using decimal fractions. A 2024 report from 
the National Center for Education Statistics found that about one third of U.S. adults tested 
lacked the skills necessary to perform calculations using decimals and fractions.
24,25 Fluid ounce 
information is therefore unlikely to be useful or material to consumers in making purchasing and    
 
9 
 
consumption decisions, particularly if those decisions are being made under a state of 
intoxication.  
 
Instead, to improve the ability of consumers to understand the amount of alcohol they are 
consuming, the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include the number of standard drinks per serving 
and a footnote stating, “A standard drink contains 0.6 fl oz of pure alcohol.” This would be better 
understood than the amount of alcohol in fluid ounces, as most public health advice is framed 
around “standard drinks,” so consumers are likely more familiar with this concept. When 
standard drinks and serving size are equivalent (as will be the case for many distilled products) 
this information could be combined into one line reading “serving/standard drink size” to save 
space. 
 
For additional context, the footnote should also include specific, actionable moderate drinking 
advice, such as the statement: “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults 
who choose to drink should limit intake to two standard drinks or less in a day for men and one 
standard drink or less in a day for women (on days when alcohol is consumed)”
26 in bold, as 
illustrated in Figure 1 (above). 
 
Consumers can only follow moderate drinking advice to the extent they are aware of it and 
including it on the label of alcoholic beverages would improve awareness while also providing a 
frame of reference for the standard drink information. Research shows that consumers respond 
best to a combination of types of alcohol content information. An experimental study found that 
labels that include both standard drink information and low-risk drinking guidelines helped 
participants more accurately estimate the amount of alcohol in a standard drink, the number of 
standard drinks in a container, and how many drinks could be consumed before reaching the low-
risk drinking limit, compared to labels that only included %ABV.
27  
 
A combination of mandatory standard drinks, a conversion factor explaining what counts as a 
standard drink, plus specific, actionable moderate drinking guidelines would best provide 
consumers with information that they can utilize in purchasing decisions and could reduce the 
risk of overconsumption leading to alcohol-related injury and death.   
 
b. The alcohol content statement should be part of the “Alcohol Facts” Statement. 
 
We agree with TTB’s proposal to require the alcohol content statement be part of the “Alcohol 
Facts” statement. Alcohol content statements are used by consumers to make decisions about 
what and how much to drink. When consumers have easy access to this information, they can 
make more informed purchasing and consumption choices that can ultimately prevent accidents 
and deaths that would have resulted from unintentional excess consumption. As mentioned 
above, polling data show that consumers desire this information to inform purchasing decisions, 
but for consumers to be informed they need to first notice and understand this information. To 
increase the likelihood that consumers notice this information, it should be a mandatory part of 
the “Alcohol Facts” statement. 
 
 
    
 
10 
 
6) In addition to the nutrition elements proposed, consumers need sugar, added sugar, 
saturated fat, and sodium information included on the “Alcohol Facts” label. 
 
When providing nutrition information on alcoholic beverages, it is important to inform 
consumers of nutrients of concern but to avoid highlighting positive nutrients in a manner that 
could mislead consumers into purchasing alcohol based on a false belief that alcohol is an 
important source of nutrition. Alcohol is a carcinogen, and increased intake increases the risk of 
multiple cancers.28 Additionally, alcohol consumption at high levels has been shown to decrease 
absorption of various micronutrients, including thiamine and folate, by changing how they are 
absorbed in the digestive tract.29 While the main health risk from drinking alcohol is the alcohol 
itself, alcohol is also a substantial contributor to average daily calorie intake for those who drink 
it,9 and can be high in nutrients of concern, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and even sodium. 
These nutrients to limit should be highlighted to improve consumers’ ability to make informed 
purchasing decisions. However, while positive nutrients, such as Vitamin C, may be present in 
alcohol at times, they should not be included on alcohol labels as this could mislead consumers 
into drinking more alcohol based on a false understanding of its impact on health. This would be 
consistent with TTB’s prohibition of any statement on alcohol that is untrue or that “tends to 
create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption.”30–32 
 
TTB’s proposed rule requires the number of calories, and the grams of carbohydrates, fat, and 
protein, per serving as part of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. While the proposal is an 
improvement over the status quo of voluntary disclosure, additional information on nutrient 
content is necessary for consumers to make informed choices about their health and should be 
made mandatory. 
 
a. Consumers want more nutrition information on alcohol. 
 
Polling data show that consumers want this information and would find it useful when making 
purchasing decisions. In a poll of U.S. adults who drink (described above), respondents said they 
would support policies to require mandatory labeling of calorie content (66%) and nutritional 
content (64%).13 And the majority of respondents said calorie (78%) and nutritional labeling 
(78%) would be at least “somewhat important” when deciding whether to purchase a particular 
alcoholic beverage. Without the Alcohol Facts label, consumers do not have adequate 
information about the content and quality of alcoholic beverages to make informed purchasing 
decisions. 
 
b. In addition to the proposed requirements for calories, carbs, fat, and protein, 
consumers would benefit from consistent access to information on total sugars, 
added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium (discussed in detail below).  
 
i. Total Sugars/Added Sugars 
TTB’s proposed rule includes mandatory disclosure of grams of carbohydrates and provides the 
option for sugar disclosure but leaves out added sugars entirely. Added sugars information is 
important because the DGA recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10% of calories 
(about 50 grams for the 2000-calorie reference diet), whereas there is no limit for total sugars.
26 
In order to follow dietary guidelines, people need to know how much added sugar they are    
 
11 
 
consuming. The average American adult consumes about 72 grams of added sugar per day, about 
40% more than the recommendation.33 Overconsumption of foods and beverages high in added 
sugars is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes34–36 and cardiovascular disease37–39 in part by 
increasing the risk of weight gain,40 and can contribute to dental decay.41 
 
Consumers are interested in sugar information. According to the 2019 FDA Food Safety and 
Nutrition Survey (FSANS), 71% of respondents said they are trying to reduce their sugar intake. 
And when looking at nutrition labels 52% look for total sugars and 34% look for added sugars.42  
 
Meanwhile, many alcoholic beverages are high in sugar. Winemakers are allowed to add 
substantial amounts of sugar after fermentation. As per TTB regulations, added sugar can 
account for up to 21% of a wine’s total weight.43 And while pure distilled liquor is sugar free, 
products containing liquor, such as liqueurs and canned cocktails, can be especially high in 
sugar. For example, a 2.5-ounce serving of the liqueur Kahlua contains 30 grams of sugar44 and a 
12-ounce can of Cutwater Pina Colada contains 32 grams of sugar.45 If these are all added 
sugars, that is over half of the recommended daily limit in a single serving of each. 
 
If the proposed rule is published without amendment, the lack of consistency with labeling of 
FDA-regulated alcoholic products, which includes added sugars, could lead to confusion. For 
example, if a consumer is accustomed to seeing total and added sugars disclosed on hard seltzer 
products and then sees an “Alcohol Facts” panel on a canned cocktail that includes some nutrient 
information but no line for sugar or added sugars, they may assume it means the canned cocktail 
contains no added sugars or even no sugar at all. Without a combination of carbohydrates, total 
sugars, and added sugars labeling, consumers are not equipped with the information they need to 
select products that fit with their dietary and health goals. 
 
ii. Saturated Fat 
The current proposed rule requires disclosure of total fat but does not even mention saturated fat. 
While the proposed rule provides an extensive explanation of how TTB arrived at other similar 
decisions (e.g., whether to include sodium and sugar content in the alcohol facts panel), there is 
no explanation of why TTB chose to include total but not saturated fat. The agency is instead 
soliciting feedback on whether any additional information on fat should be included. 
 
The focus on total fat over type of fat is misaligned with the DGA, which focus on type of fat 
instead of total fat. Indeed, in 2015, the DGA stopped emphasizing total fat and changed the 
focus to limiting saturated fat.
46,47 The Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee reaffirmed advice from previous years to “limit foods and beverages higher in 
saturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent of calories per day 
starting at age 2 by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly [polyunsaturated fatty acids].”48  
 
Consumers are interested in this information and fat and saturated fat are present in some 
alcoholic beverages. In the 2019 FDA FSANS, 43% of respondents reported that they look at 
total fat on the Nutrition Facts label, and 30% look at saturated fat.
42 While many alcoholic 
beverages contain no fat, consumers might be unaware that some contain high amounts of 
saturated fat. For example, Baileys Irish Cream has 7 grams of total fat per 1.7 ounce serving, of 
which 4 grams are saturated fat (20% of the recommended daily value),49,50 making this product    
 
12 
 
“high” in saturated fat by FDA standards. Cutwater Espresso Martini, a canned cocktail, contains 
14 grams of total fat per 12-ounce can but does not disclose how much of that is saturated fat.51 
For both products, this information is only available online with no on-bottle indication that the 
information is available. To improve transparency and allow consumers to make informed 
choices, TTB should mandate that both fat and saturated fat appear on the “Alcohol Facts” label. 
 
iii. Sodium 
The current proposed rule does not include any micronutrients, and for the most part we agree 
with this choice (see below). However, disclosure of sodium content should be mandatory given 
consumer interest and the strong need for sodium reduction at the population level. Dietary 
sodium is an important nutrient to monitor due to the connection between excess sodium intake, 
increased blood pressure, and development of cardiovascular disease.52 The DGA recommend 
that adults adhere to a 2,300 milligrams daily sodium limit26  but, according to data from 2021-
2023 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Americans ages 20 and older consume 
far more, an average of 3,212 milligrams per day.53 Reducing sodium intake by 1,200 milligrams 
per day could prevent an estimated 44,000 to 92,000 deaths from any cause and prevent 32,000–
66,000 strokes, 54,000–99,000 myocardial infarctions, and 60,000–120,000 cases of coronary 
heart disease.54 
 
Consumers are interested in this information and may not know that sodium is present in some 
alcoholic beverages. Data from the 2019 FDA FSANS show that 46% of consumers are 
watching their sodium intake and 49% look at sodium on the Nutrition Facts label.42 While many 
alcoholic beverages have little to no sodium, some canned cocktails contain considerable 
amounts, such as Cutwater Spicy Bloody Mary, which has 390 milligrams of sodium (17% DV) 
per 12-ounce can.55 Also, the Gose style of beer is traditionally salted. SeaQuench, a popular 
Gose beer by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, contains 105 milligrams of sodium (5% DV) in a 12-
ounce serving.56 Consumers who seek to limit their sodium intake rely on labels to monitor the 
sodium content of products and would benefit from sodium labeling on alcoholic beverages. 
 
c. All nutrition information should be mandatory, provided consistently, and 
accompanied by percent Daily Value information. 
 
As mentioned above, a CSPI analysis of top beer and wine brands found that the voluntary 
statement of average analysis was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.14 The option to 
provide nutrition information voluntarily has been available to industry since 2013.4 It will not 
become consistently available to consumers unless it is required. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at specific 
levels. The current proposal requires all nutritional elements to be listed as part of the “Alcohol 
Facts” label, regardless of amount. Some producers might argue that because products in their 
beverage category rarely or never contain fat, they should not have to label fat content. We 
recognize that many consumers may not expect alcoholic beverages to be a source of fat, outside 
certain categories (e.g. cream-based liqueurs). However, understanding when a product contains 
0 grams of a nutrient may be informative for consumers seeking to track their intake. One option 
that could help provide consumers with information while focusing on nutritional elements that 
are most informative would be for TTB to build on an approach already used by the FDA for    
 
13 
 
some nutrients,57 and allow products containing a zero in certain nutrients (e.g., saturated fat, 
added sugars), to omit that nutrient and instead bear a footnote stating, “Not a significant source 
of______.”  
 
TTB should also follow FDA’s lead and require the percentage of the Daily Value (%DV) of the 
listed nutrients (when applicable) as %DV provides context for the amount of each nutrient 
present. 
 
d. Additional harmonization with FDA labels would not be beneficial. 
 
TTB is also soliciting feedback on whether it should harmonize the “Alcohol Facts” label with 
FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” label and whether numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral 
content should be permitted on alcoholic beverages. The suggestions above would help 
harmonize TTB’s alcohol facts label with FDA’s label in part, but the two should not be 
harmonized further. Because alcohol should not be seen as a source of nutrition, it is unnecessary 
to adopt the full nutrient labeling required because, as explained previously, vitamins and 
minerals considered to be positive nutrients could mislead consumers to believe that 
consumption of alcoholic beverages has significant nutritional value or other health-related 
benefits.  
 
The importance of not emphasizing positive nutrients on alcohol given its known health harm 
was recently affirmed when Molson Coors settled a lawsuit for $9.5 million that alleged its 
advertisement of Vizzy hard seltzer as containing “antioxidant vitamin C from acerola 
superfruit” was misleading.
58 The plaintiffs alleged that claim was misleading on the grounds 
that most consumers already consume sufficient Vitamin C, the amount of Vitamin C added does 
not provide a proven health benefit, and alcohol consumption interferes with nutrient absorption.  
Due to the risk for consumer confusion and deceptive marketing of alcoholic beverages as 
healthy, vitamins, minerals (other than sodium), monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and 
fiber should not be included as part of the alcohol facts statement. 
 
7) The proposed tolerance levels for panel element calculation are appropriate. 
 
We agree with the proposed tolerance of +/- 20% for each nutrient content element. These 
tolerances align with what is allowed on the Nutrition Facts statement mandated by FDA.59 The 
ranges specified in the proposed rule are an improvement over the tolerances set forth in TTB 
Procedure 2020-1, which sets an upper but not lower tolerance limit for calories, carbohydrates, 
and fat, stating that products may be “within a reasonable range below the labeled or advertised 
amount” and a lower but not upper limit for protein.60 The +/- 20% tolerance ranges strike a 
balance of being generous enough to allow for the option to use databases for standard products 
while still providing consumers information accurate enough to make informed choices about 
their health. The tolerance limits should not be increased as this would diminish their usefulness 
to consumers. 
 
     
 
14 
 
8) All products with 0.5% ABV or more should clearly list %ABV. 
 
a. Beers Not Defined as “Malt Beverages"" and Non-Alcoholic (NA) Beers 
 
We agree with TTB’s decision to mandate an alcohol content statement on the labels of beers not 
defined as “malt beverages.” These products, which are under FDA labeling jurisdiction, are 
required to bear the “Nutrition Facts” panel, but consumers often miss out on vital alcohol 
content information because %ABV is not mandatory. This information is both important for 
public health and, as explained in the rule, would facilitate revenue protection by making it clear 
that the products are subject to tax.1 
 
We also agree with TTB’s decision to require an “Alcohol Facts” statement for non-alcoholic 
malt beverages under TTB control, but to not require a specific statement of the percentage of 
alcohol by volume. An “Alcohol Facts” statement is needed to inform consumers of their calorie 
and nutritional content, but since “non-alcoholic” is clearly defined for malt beverages, these 
products can be exempt from the requirement to disclose %ABV and fluid ounces of pure 
ethanol, as long as the proper terminology appears on-package. The phrase “contains less than 
0.5 percent (or .5%) alcohol by volume” is currently required to appear directly adjacent to the 
term “non-alcoholic.”
61 
b. Wine 
 
We agree with TTB’s proposal to require %ABV labeling on all wine. Percent ABV is currently 
only required on wines with less than 7% ABV or greater than 14% ABV (wines of 7-14% ABV 
can omit this information if labeled “table wine”),62 but wine should not be exempt from 
providing accurate, specific mandatory statements of %ABV on label. Consumers can only make 
informed decisions about how much to drink if they have access to information on alcohol 
strength. 
 
Labeling with only a %ABV range would leave consumers with incomplete information about 
the strength of wine. As mentioned above, this is basic information that consumers look for and 
mandating this information is robustly supported by consumers and important to their purchasing 
decisions. A %ABV range is not specific enough to fully inform consumers as there is double the 
amount of alcohol in a same-sized serving of a 14% ABV wine compared to a 7% ABV wine. 
With only a %ABV range, consumers may accidentally consume more alcohol than intended, 
which increases the risk of alcohol-related injuries and death. 
 
9) Clear formatting requirements are needed to ensure consumers can consistently find 
nutrition and alcohol content information. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on format and display of the “Alcohol Facts” panel including requests 
for comment on general formatting, linear display, and whether the option to provide “Alcohol 
Facts” solely via QR code should be allowed. 
 
 
1 Note: for beers not defined as “malt beverages” that are regulated by the FDA, TTB plans to use its authority 
under the Internal Revenue Code to require “Alcohol Facts” information on these products    
 
15 
 
a. General Formatting Recommendations 
 
The proposed rule requires that the panel or linear display be offset within a box by use of 
hairlines with all black (or one color) type on a contrasting background in an easy-to-read type 
style that uses both upper- and lower-case letters. Minimum type size is 1 millimeter for smaller 
containers and 2 millimeters for larger containers. The terms “Alcohol Facts” and “Amount per 
serving” must appear in bold. 
 
Overall we agree with these requirements, and request additional requirements for a larger type 
size for calories, minimum spacing and kerning, and a standardized font, all of which are 
required by FDA on the Nutrition Facts panel (see Figure 5 for example of FDA-regulated 
alcohol).
63 However, linear formatting should only be allowed on very small containers. We also 
urge TTB to adopt greater specificity with regard to providing contrasting color, as this term is 
subject to potentially wide interpretation, and suggest that the TTB use language adopted by 
FDA in regulations for Nutrition Facts, which require that the disclosure “shall be all black or 
one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical.”
64 
TTB should additionally specify, at minimum, that “contrasting background” does not include 
two different shades of the same color (as is popular on some beer cans currently and difficult to 
read) (see Figure 6). 
 
b. Display Orientation and Format 
 
The proposed rule allows for horizontal or vertical “Alcohol Facts”. Requiring that this 
information appear in a horizontal format would increase the chances that consumers notice and 
utilize it, as a vertical format requires the consumer to take the additional step of turning the 
bottle sideways to access the information (see Figure 4). TTB should only allow vertical 
presentation of “Alcohol Facts” on smaller packages. A literature review prepared for Food 
Standards Australia New Zealand included “text to be printed horizontally rather than vertically” 
in a summary of factors that gain attention on food labels.65 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether consumers would have trouble locating an “Alcohol 
Facts” panel using a linear display. The current proposal allows for “Alcohol Facts” information 
to be displayed in either panel (as shown in Figure 5) or linear format (as shown in Figure 6), 
but linear formatting should only be allowed on smaller containers.  
 
The panel format would make the “Alcohol Facts” information easier for consumers to locate 
and read compared to a linear display. TTB notes that they are providing this option to prevent 
businesses from having to purchase new equipment to add an additional label. A CSPI analysis 
of the labels of products from the top wine and beer brands (described above) found that, of 
wines and beers that contained serving information, only 5% used a block (also known as panel) 
format whereas 95% used the continuous (also known as linear) format.
14 This suggests a strong 
industry preference for this format and a likelihood that this will continue to be used heavily. 
Because the linear format is difficult for consumers to find and read, TTB should mandate panel 
format on most packages to avoid this outcome.  
    
 
16 
 
Currently, FDA only allows the option for linear presentation of the mandatory Nutrition Facts 
panel for products in very small packages, which does not include standard-size products, as 
such packages are large enough to carry nutrition facts and ingredients.66 If linear display is 
allowed, it should be reserved as an option for containers below a certain size and required to 
appear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type to aid consumers in locating it.

c. Maximum Type Size for %ABV on Malt Beverage 
 
TTB should remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol 
content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an “Alcohol Facts” statement but specify 
instead that the %ABV must be the same size as the other text in the “Alcohol Facts” statement 
(no larger, no smaller). For malt beverages, there is no need for TTB to remove the maximum 
type size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label, as this 
information would be easy to find alongside other important per-serving information in the 
“Alcohol Facts” panel.  
 
d. Electronic Display Should Not be Allowed 
 
We support TTB’s proposed approach of requiring the alcohol content and nutrition information 
to be listed on the physical beverage container. There should not be an option to provide this 
solely via QR code. Electronic disclosure places a barrier between consumers and this vital 
health and safety information.  
 
Consumers prefer to receive this information directly on the product packaging. In the March 
2024 poll mentioned above, adults who drink alcohol were asked: “How would you prefer to 
learn about the ingredients, alcohol content, allergens, calories, and nutritional content of an 
alcoholic beverage?” Respondents could select one of four response options: 
• Read this information on the label of the container 
• Scan a QR code on the label 
• Visit a website address provided on the label 
• I do not want to learn this information 
 
More than three quarters (76%) of respondents said they would prefer to read information on the 
label of the container, while only 11% preferred to scan a QR code. The desire to see this 
information on-package was particularly strong among respondents living in suburban (79%) and 
rural communities (78%) compared to those living in urban communities (70%) and respondents 
over the age of 65 (83%) compared to younger respondents (71% of respondents ages 21-34) 
(Appendix A). 
 
Barriers created by QR code disclosures would disproportionately affect consumers who are 
older or have lower incomes. Accessing a QR code requires a smartphone, which not all 
consumers have, and Internet access coupled with good reception, which not all stores and 
drinking venues provide. In 2024, 84% of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned 
smartphones compared to 96% of adults with an annual household incomes over $100,000.
67 
These data show similar sized gaps in smartphone ownership by age, with 79% of adults aged 65 
and older owning smartphones compared to 91 to 98% of adults in younger age groups.  
 
Those living in rural or tribal areas would also be disproportionately impacted by lack of access 
to information if provided via QR code. A recent Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) 
report,
68 which included data from 2022, shows a rural-urban gap for access to high-speed 
mobile internet (defined as 5G-New Radio (5G-NR) with upload/download speeds at least 35/3    
 
18 
 
megabits per second (Mbps)) with 64% access in rural areas versus 98% in urban areas. People 
living in tribal areas also face lower rates of access to reliable mobile internet (78%) compared to 
those living in urban areas. Even rates of “fixed terrestrial services” (i.e., fixed broadband 
services excluding fixed satellite service) deployments at all internet speeds differ for rural 
versus urban versus tribal areas, with especially large gaps in access to internet speeds of 100/20 
Mbps (which FCC uses as a benchmark to assess progress towards the goal of ensuring all 
Americans have access to “advanced telecommunications capability.”) While 98% of Americans 
living in urban areas have access to fixed terrestrial service speeds of 100/20 Mbps, only 72% of 
those living in rural areas and 76% of those living in tribal areas have access to this internet 
service speed. 
 
Moreover, loading information through a QR code takes time, further deterring use and 
prolonging purchasing decisions. A loading time of even a few seconds could prolong shopping 
time if comparing many products, making it less likely the information will be utilized. 
 
Alcohol industry members will complain about the lack of label space and argue that it will cost 
extra to place this information on-package, but they are already providing a full nutrition facts 
panel on-package for all alcoholic beverages that fall under FDA’s jurisdiction (see Figure 5). 
And non-mandatory label information, such as marketing, could be presented via QR code if 
industry members are concerned about label space. 
 
10) The compliance period should be shortened to 3.5 years and harmonized with the 
allergens labeling rule to minimize cost. 
 
Throughout the proposed rule, TTB is soliciting feedback on the cost that these changes might 
have for industry. Producers will incur some costs when implementing updated labeling 
requirements and may opt to pass these costs along to consumers. But alcohol manufacturers, 
including small producers, with products under FDA’s jurisdiction have been successfully 
providing similar labels for years and remain economically viable. For example, most hard cider 
producers must comply with FDA labeling rules, and local and regional hard cider sales 
increased by 6% from 2022 to 2023,
69 demonstrating that small alcoholic beverage businesses 
can thrive while adhering to comprehensive labeling requirements. Additionally, some beverages 
are providing some of this information already on a voluntary basis. As mentioned above, an 
analysis of labels from top wine and beer brands that 63% of beers chose to include the statement 
of average analysis—proof that this is feasible. 
 
It is also worth noting that higher prices for alcoholic beverages, assuming that manufacturers 
pass at least some of any added costs on to consumers, would not be a bad thing from a public 
health perspective. Policies that increase the price of alcohol decrease alcohol consumption.
70 
Alcohol prices and taxes are inversely associated with alcohol-related morbidity and mortality 
including violence, traffic crash fatalities, and drunk driving.71 An increase in the price of 
alcoholic beverages could help those who drink to better adhere to moderate drinking guidelines 
and lead to a reduction in alcohol-related morbidity and related costs.  
 
     
 
19 
 
Still, it is understandable that TTB is conscious of the price of these changes and the costs of 
relabeling are such that the impact upon price will be limited. Costs can be minimized by 
selecting a fair compliance deadline and coordinating the compliance deadline with the allergen 
labeling rule. 
 
a. Selecting a Fair Compliance Date 
 
The proposed compliance period of 5 years is too long. According to FDA, food and beverage 
products tend to be voluntarily relabeled on a 2-5 year cycle, with most products undergoing 
voluntary label changes at least every 2-3 years.
72 Generally, the cost of label changes includes 
new labeling equipment (if needed) and any costs associated with label redesign, printing, and 
administrative costs. While extra staff time for mandatory label specific changes may add slight 
cost, when label changes for regulatory purposes coincide with changes the manufacturer would 
have made to their label in any case, the analysis estimates that there is minimal additional cost 
for the label design change to the manufacturer if no new labeling equipment is needed. 
 
TTB’s own economic estimates demonstrate that the extended 5-year cycle is unnecessary as it 
provides little to no cost savings relative to a 3.5-year compliance period. The agency model 
assumes that for brand name products, 100% of changes would overlap with a regularly 
scheduled change within 2 years and that private labels, which make up a smaller share of the 
market, would be able to coordinate 100% of their changes by the 3.5-year mark. The model 
estimates that there are per-UPC cost reductions in extending the compliance period from 2 years 
to 3.5 years, but from 3.5 years onward the cost per UPC does not decrease further. Similarly, the 
total cost would not decrease further by extending the compliance period out past 3.5 years. 
 
Another metric used in TTB’s analysis, the total cost using a 2% discount rate, similarly sees a 
dramatic decrease in the total cost when extending the deadline from 2 years to 3.5 years ($323.4 
million at 2 years down to $259.5 million at 3 years and down to $204.3 million 3.5 years). 
However, the reduction in price is far smaller when extending from a 3.5- to a 5-year compliance 
period, which reduces the discounted total by only ~$3 million more (1.5%). Based on TTB’s 
own analysis, a 3.5-year compliance period would be more than fair and strike a balance between 
minimizing cost to industry and getting consumers access to important and long overdue 
information in a timely fashion. 
 
b. Coordinating Compliance Date Among Other TTB Rulings 
 
To further minimize costs, we recommend that TTB align the compliance dates for the two 
current proposed rules. We also urge TTB to release the third rule on ingredients labeling, which 
was previously sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
73 This is a pre-rule and 
as such would likely take much longer than the other two rules to finalize. Because full 
coordination of all three rules would likely lead to significant delay of the first two rules, we 
recommend that compliance dates on only the first two rules be coordinated. 
 
     
 
20 
 
11) Conclusion 
 
Increased transparency for alcohol labeling is desired by consumers and long overdue. We hope 
that TTB will move swiftly to finalize this proposed rule with the adjustments described above 
so that consumers can have access to the nutrition and alcohol content information that they want 
and need to make informed decisions about their health.

Re: TTB Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverage 
 
Dear Director Greenberg, 
 
I write on behalf of the Brewers Association (BA) to provide written input on TTB 
Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverage.1  We appreciate the extension of the comment period for this 
notice and respectfully submit these written comments on behalf of America’s 
small and independent brewers.  We thank you in advance for your time and 
attention to these comments. 
 
As you know, The Brewers Association is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association 
of brewers, for brewers and by brewers.  We have approximately 5,000 U.S. 
professional brewery members and over 1,200 supplier members from throughout 
the beer supply chain.  Our mission is to promote and protect American 
craft brewers and their beers. 
 
The Brewers Association has long championed transparency in the labeling and 
advertising of malt beverages (those subject to the Federal Alcohol Administration 
Act2 – FAA Act) and all beer.  We have called for mandatory alcohol content labeling 
and disclosure of major allergens3 for many years.  But America’s small and 
independent brewers also face unprecedented headwinds today.  A crowded 
marketplace, consumption declines, rising supply and labor costs, financially 
challenged consumers, and other difficulties have seen the market for our 
members’ beer (and, indeed, all beer) contract and brewery closings outpace 
openings last year for the first time in decades.

Given these headwinds, we urge TTB to pay special attention to small businesses’ 
needs in proceeding with any new labeling mandate.  TTB and its predecessor have 
considered mandatory nutrient and nutritional labeling regulations since the 1970s, 
belying any argument that new regulations are urgently needed.  Moreover, while 
Notice 237 embraces some ideas – notably more generous tolerances and a five-
year phase-in period – that would mitigate a final rule’s impact on small business, 
substantial burdens remain.  Those burdens will fall with particular force on small 
batch products of small producers, tilting the playing field even more in favor of 
large multinational brewers.  We urge TTB to consider carefully the impact of its 
actions on small American manufacturers as it moves forward. 
 
1. History Justiﬁes a Healthy Skepticism About this Rule 
 
Any keen observer of the federal regulation of labeling and marketing of malt 
beverages, wine, and distilled spirits must surely get a sense of “déjà vu all over 
again”4 when reviewing the nutritional disclosure mandates proposed in Notice 237.  
In addition, taking a broader societal look at the record of such nutritional 
disclosure mandates, it is hard not to question their effectiveness in achieving their 
objectives. 
 
TTB’s predecessor, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), first 
proposed nutrient labeling rules, in the form of mandatory ingredient labeling, in the 
1970s.  ATF proposed ingredient labeling and then withdrew the proposal in 1975, 
concluding that the costs of the proposal outweighed any benefit to consumers.5  
The federal Food & Drug Administration (FDA) promptly stepped in, proposing 
ingredient labeling for alcohol beverage labels imposed under its existing federal 
Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authority.6  A legal challenge to FDA’s action 
helped persuade FDA to abandon that effort, deferring to ATF on products subject 
to the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FAA Act.7 
 
With FDA deferring to ATF, ATF itself commencing rulemaking to impose an 
ingredient (nutrient) labeling regime of its own on FAA Act-regulated products, with 
regulations published in 1980.8  The incoming Administration of President Ronald 
Reagan sought to withdraw these regulations, eventually succeeding after a series 
of court decisions to resolve a legal challenge to ATF’s decision to withdraw the 
rule.9  The saga, of course, was not over, and the next round of proposals, this time 
with mandatory nutritional information in addition to nutrient/ingredient 
disclosures, emerged in the early 2000s.  Notice 237 acknowledges and catalogues 
those and subsequent nutritional labeling efforts by TTB.10

While the ATF and TTB concluded, multiple times, to focus limited resources 
elsewhere in the past fifty years, other parts of the federal government pursued an 
agenda of mandatory nutritional labeling on multiple fronts.  Efforts to impose 
nutritional labeling on food kicked off in 1969 with the White House Conference on 
Food, Nutrition, and Health recommending FDA regulations.11  By 1973, that 
recommendation had yielded final FDA regulations that were mandatory for foods 
making any nutrition claims or when nutrients were added to the food.  By the late 
1980s, a chorus of advocacy called for universal nutritional labeling on food, and 
amidst multiple FDA proposals, Congress responded by passing the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act (NLEA).12  The NLEA gave FDA explicit authority to 
require nutritional labeling on most food packages and resulted in final FDA 
regulations that were published in 1993. 
 
Following the imposition of near-universal nutritional labeling for packaged foods, 
food service at restaurants represented the next frontier.  The Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)13 required chain restaurants (those that are 
part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and 
offering for sale substantially the same menu items) to disclose calorie and other 
nutrition information to consumers at the point of sale.  FDA regulations 
implementing the ACA’s mandate went into effect in 2018,14 although multiple cities 
and states already had mandated calorie and nutritional disclosures for restaurants 
earlier. 
 
All told, since 1970 the subject of nutrient and nutritional disclosures for foods has 
taken up thousands of pages of the Federal Register, along with numerous rulings, 
interpretive guidance documents, and official government websites.  The primary 
purpose of all these mandates has been to induce Americans to eat healthier, with 
a particular emphasis on controlling excessive calorie intake.  One would think, 
then, that fifty-plus years of federal government action would have produced a track 
record of success, with Americas eating healthier than ever before. 
 
Of course, history tells a very different story.  Obesity rates have soared, with each 
new round of mandatory nutritional labeling having no discernable impact on the 
crises.

In sharp contrast, per-capita alcohol consumption has remained remarkably steady 
since 1970, largely tracking demographic and economic patters.16  Indeed, in the 
past three years alcohol beverage consumption has fallen to historic lows.17  In 
short, decades of real-world experience provide zero evidence that nutritional 
labeling leads to healthier eating choices, nor that the absence of such labeling on 
alcohol beverages increases unhealthy consumption. 
 
Finally, we cannot help but note the irony that the current effort to impose 
nutritional labeling on alcohol arose from 2022’s Treasury Report on Competition.18  
The Treasury Report found that ‘‘[r]egulatory proposals that could serve public 
health and foster competition by providing information to consumers, such as 
mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been 
implemented” and urged the TTB to take action to revive rulemaking on nutrition 
labelling, among several subjects.19  But even a casual review of Notice 237 would 
conclude that it is about consumer information and education, not competition.  
Indeed, by mandating a uniform set of disclosures by nearly all alcohol beverage 
producers, any final rule will have the effect (like all regulations) of removing an

aspect of competition (competing for consumers by providing more nutritional 
information) and replacing it with a government mandate.  A government mandate 
replacing competition is the antithesis of fostering competition.  Moreover, as 
explained further below, by imposing disproportionate burdens on small producers 
versus large, new nutritional disclosure mandates could further tilt the playing field 
towards large market share companies and against market entrants and upstart 
competitors. 
 
2. A Final Rule will Burden Small Producers 
 
The Brewers Association appreciates TTB’s efforts to mitigate the impact of the 
proposed nutritional mandate on small businesses.  While Notice 237’s broader 
tolerances for calculating alcohol content and nutritional measures and its five-
year implementation period certainly help, we wish to emphasize that a final rule 
will impose substantial burdens on many small and independent brewers, as well 
as small wineries, distilleries, and cider makers. 
 
More generous tolerances will often allow a brewer to promulgate compliant 
nutritional measures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) using typical values 
charts, but only for “standard products”20 (e.g., a beer made from only malted 
barley, hops, water, and yeast).  Similarly, the +/- 1% alcohol by volume (ABV) 
tolerance proposed in Notice 237 will allow brewers to calculate alcohol content 
without outside testing or sophisticated equipment.  But in today’s innovative 
brewing industry, a great many products use other ingredients in brewing, such as 
exotic grains, fruits, nuts, herbs and spices, flavorings, and a myriad of other food 
products.  For example, this spring the Brewers Association solicited comments 
from its members on topics related to Notice 237, including whether they produce 
products made with non-standard ingredients.  Of the 83 respondents, 77 (over 
90%) indicated that they make some beers using special ingredients.  We believe 
that the respondents provide a representative sample of today’s craft brewers. 
 
TTB’s Public COLAs Registry confirms that non-standard malt beverages make up a 
substantial part of today’s total malt beverage market.  A search of the Registry 
earlier this month21 identified a total of 29,752 malt beverage label approvals in the 
past year.  Of those, 9,159 were class/type 906, malt beverage specialties – flavored 
malt beverages.  In other words, over thirty percent of new malt beverage labels 
likely contain flavorings or other ingredients that could render the use of typical 
values tables non-compliant.  For such products in interstate commerce, expensive 
testing – either by an outside lab or by purchasing new equipment – would be 
required to ensure compliance. 
 
In addition, although many Brewers Association members change labels at least 
once every five years, many do not.  The responses to the Brewers Association 
survey contain many too general to clearly denote whether product labels change 
more- or less than every five years.  But roughly one-third of the respondents appear 
 
20 A point TTB appears to recognize.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. 
21 On August 7, 2025. 6 
 
to change labels less often (some indicating they never update labels on existing 
products unless required to do so), and another one-third provided ambiguous 
answers suggestive of long waits before label re-design.  While the five-year cycle 
likely holds true for the large brewers and most other large suppliers, it does not 
appear to reflect the entirety or even a substantial majority of the craft beer market. 
 
Notice 237, as written, will particularly impact practices of craft brewers to vary 
recipes of a particular brand.  This practice occurs most frequently in the case of 
seasonal products, with an annual release (for example, a holiday ale) delighting 
consumers with variations in the recipe, keeping the brewery’s customers 
interested in trying the beer year after year.  Brewers employing this practice will 
need to either print new labels each year, something many do not do today, or stop 
varying the recipe each year.  In short, Notice 237 could force many brewers to 
choose between increased costs (to print new labels every year) or reduced 
innovation (by keeping recipes consistent year-over-year). 
 
In sum, while Notice 237 takes some steps to mitigate its impact on small 
producers, it will still have a negative impact on our members, with the biggest 
burden falling on the smallest packaging brewers with the least ability to absorb 
additional costs.  The result will be a combination of greater costs, reduced 
innovation, and simple non-compliance. 
 
3. The Brewers Association Continues to Believe that DiƯerentiating 
Between Large and Small Batch Products is Appropriate and Within TTB’s 
Authority 
 
There is no question that a nutrition labeling rule will impose burdens on small 
producers and the viability of small-batch products.  Although the more realistic 
tolerances proposed in Notice 237 partially blunt these burdens, flavored and other 
specialty malt beverages will continue to face a difficult choice under final rules if 
adopted as proposed:  (a) invest in expensive equipment to test such products; (b) 
send such products to an outside laboratory at considerable expense; or (c) 
discontinue such products in interstate commerce to avoid the added expense.  In 
light of this, the Brewers Association renews its call for TTB to adopt a different 
standard for small producers or low-volume products – which would include most 
products from small producers – to mitigate a nutrition labeling rule’s impact on 
small businesses and on product innovation. 
 
TTB’s reasoning22 for rejecting differentiation between small-batch products and 
others does not withstand closer scrutiny.  As a threshold observation, TTB’s 
regulations are full of differential treatment for brewers based on size.23  In its 
explanation for rejecting this approach, TTB notes – but tellingly without claiming a 
lack of statutory authorization – that the statutory text of the FAA Act does not 
explicitly authorize different treatment between large and small entities or between 
large and small batch size products.  But that text also does not reference 
 
22 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6687. 
23 See 27 C.F .R. §§ 25.91, 25.93, 25.164-25.165, & 25.297. 7 
 
nutritional labeling and a host of other subjects now addressed in existing TTB 
regulations.  Notice 237 itself invokes the Agency’s “broad authority” to regulate 
alcohol.24  Notwithstanding the lack of an explicit statement in the statutory text, we 
believe it is well within the TTB’s discretion to create different rules based on 
producer size, product volume, and batch size. 
 
Notice 237 additionally asserts that an exemption or differential treatment would 
undermine the “primary” purpose of the rule, which is providing more information 
to consumers.25  Before addressing the substance of this position, we note that this 
assertion undermines both the original impetus for initiating this rulemaking 
(premised on competition as announced in the Treasury Report on Competition), 
and TTB’s claimed basis for imposing alcohol content labeling on non-FAA Act 
products (premised on protection and collection of excise tax revenue).  
 
There is no reason a final rule cannot balance consumer information with the need 
to protect competition and the interests of small businesses.  We acknowledge, of 
course, that exempting or loosening standards for some small subset of the market 
would marginally limit the information available to consumers.  But TTB and other 
food labeling authorities already do this in a myriad of ways: 
 
 The nutritional labeling requirements (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and 
proteins) only apply to products moving in interstate commerce, thereby 
already exempting many products that do not cross state lines.   
 
 Several categories of alcohol beverages, notably including fermented hard 
seltzers, most hard ciders, and other low-alcohol wines, would not fall under 
Notice 237’s nutritional label rules.  While some of these (depending on 
production quantity and business size – see below) would fall under FDA’s 
nutritional labeling requirements, those requirements are diƯerent in 
multiple respects from the requirements proposed in Notice 237. 
 
 The primary regulator imposing nutritional and other food label disclosures, 
the FDA, exempts products produced in quantities under 100,000 units in a 
year from its nutritional labeling requirements.26 
 
 The FDA also exempts from those regulations retailers who have no more 
than $500,000 in direct sales to consumers or no more than $50,000 in sales 
of food or dietary supplements to consumers.27 
 
 The FDA’s requirement for menu labeling disclosures only applies to 
restaurants and similar retail establishments that are a part of a chain with 
20 or more locations and doing business under the same name.28 
 
24 See, e.g., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6654. 
25 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6687. 
26 See 21 C.F .R. §§ 101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(h)(2). 
27 See 21 C.F .R. §§ 101.9(j)(1) and 101.36(h)(1). 
28 See 21 C.F .R. § 101.11(a) (deﬁning “covered establishment”). 8 
 
 
In short, a sensible exemptions or adjustments for small batch products or small 
businesses would hardly be unprecedented and, in our view, would strike the 
appropriate balance between informing the consumer and promoting rigorous 
competition and consumer choice. 
 
A different requirement for small-batch products would be no harder to administer 
than a host of other TTB rules that rely on industry member representations to make 
determinations during the Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) review process.  On 
issues as varied as class/type designation, alcohol content, interstate jurisdiction, 
and method of manufacture, TTB relies on the industry members providing it with 
truthful information to review and approve COLAs.  TTB then polices the market to 
ensure that the industry member did not, for example, fill a container labeled with 
one TTB beverage type with liquid that constitutes another type.  TTB could easily 
add a field to its COLA application form29 to identify whether or not a product 
qualifies for different treatment under a small-batch or small business threshold.  
Should an industry member rely on such a COLA for products that have exceeded 
the threshold, TTB would retain its considerable enforcement authority to police the 
market and punish non-compliance.  As a reminder to the industry member, TTB 
can also “qualify” a label approval for a small-batch product, just as it does for 
Certificates of Exemption from Label Approval and in other appropriate 
circumstances. 
 
4. If Regulations are Adopted, TTB Should Use the Term “Serving Facts” 
instead of “Alcohol Facts”30 
 
Notice 237 adopts the term “alcohol facts” as a shorthand for the specific 
nutritional and other disclosures it would mandate, and the term would accompany 
the disclosures on actual labels.  The Brewers Association opposes this departure 
from TTB’s current term for voluntary nutritional labels, “serving facts,” and urges 
TTB to revert to that term should it move forward with Notice 237. 
 
For over a decade consumers have seen the term “serving facts” on FAA Act-
regulated alcohol beverages bearing voluntary nutritional information.31  
Consumers, particularly those with an interest in such information, now recognize 
and understand the label and rely on it.  Moreover, we are not aware of any 
problems or confusion arising from use of the term “serving facts.”  As such, the 
reasoning behind the proposed change is not readily apparent. 
 
The term “alcohol facts” seems, at best, incongruous, and at worst, misdescriptive.  
Most of the nutritional information proposed for disclosure in Notice 237 are, in 
fact, facts about various nutritional measures (not alcohol) per serving – in other 
words, serving facts.  Surely consumers think of information on calories, 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein as serving facts, regardless of whether that

30 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.1., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6664-65. 
31 See TTB Ruling 2013–2 (May 28, 2013). 9 
 
information relates to a product containing alcohol or not.  In contrast, the term 
“alcohol facts” implies facts about alcohol consumption, which the information 
proposed for disclosure in Notice 237 does not contain. 
 
The Brewers Association disagrees with the suggestion, apparently made by certain 
commenters and accepted by TTB, that “serving facts” would confuse consumers 
about the alcoholic nature of products.  As noted above, the Brewers Association is 
not aware of any problems with the voluntary use of “serving facts” under current 
TTB policy and rulings.  Moreover, there are many label indicia under existing 
regulations governing FAA Act-regulated products signaling that a product contains 
alcohol, including: 
 
 The mandatory government warning statement. 
 
 The class and/or type designation. 
 
 The alcohol content statement on most products, which Notice 237 would 
extend to all products, including all malt beverages and wines. 
 
Moreover, consumers respond to common-sense information such as the brand 
name of the product, as brand conveys important clues to consumers about the 
nature of the products they buy (i.e., consumers associate “Sierra Nevada” with 
malt beverages and “Pepsi” with soft drinks).  The notion that a consumer will 
ignore all such information and instead focus myopically on the words “serving 
facts” to infer a product contains no alcohol makes no sense. 
 
Finally, Notice 237 ignores the reality that another subset of alcohol beverages 
already use a different term than “alcohol facts” without any apparent problem.  
Products labeled under the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FDA must use the 
term “nutrition facts.”32  Such products include fermented hard seltzers, most hard 
ciders, and other low-alcohol wine products.  Yet to our knowledge, use of the 
words “nutrition facts” has not misled consumers about the alcoholic nature of 
these beverages. 
 
If mandatory nutritional labeling rules are finalized, they should use the term 
“serving facts” and not “alcohol facts.” 
 
5. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports the 
Decision to Keep Disclosures Consistent with the Current Statement of 
Average Analysis33 
 
The Brewers Association supports Notice 237’s approach to limit nutritional 
disclosures to those familiar to consumers of light beer and other existing products 
– calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  These four measures have graced the 
labels of many malt beverages since 1980, when TTB’s predecessor ATF first 
 
32 See 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. 
33 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.2., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6666-67. 10 
 
mandated the use of a statement of average analysis on “light”/“lite” beer labels.34  
We see no reason to depart from that successful policy. 
 
The Brewers Association does not support a rule that would mandate more 
extensive nutritional disclosures, like those mandated under the FD&C Act.35  
Should TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the information required 
under Notice 237’s proposed rule already will depart from FDA-mandated 
information due to the inclusion of alcohol content information.  Moreover, labels of 
FAA Act regulated products will depart from FDA-regulated products in multiple 
other ways, including the inclusion of the mandatory Government Warning 
Statement, a different standard of identity system, and the lack of ingredient 
labeling information.  While FDA regulations and policy can provide useful guidance 
in appropriate circumstances, we do not believe that a lock-step adoption of FD&C 
Act nutritional information is appropriate. 
 
In implementing nutritional labeling disclosures, the Brewers Association 
recommends a common-sense refinement where multiple measures would round 
to zero.  In such cases, industry members should have the option of truncating the 
disclosure of multiple measures as “0.”  This would amend currently proposed 
regulations, if finalized, to instead provide the option of stating “0 [the measures 
that would display as zero].”  For example, many malt beverages contain zero fat 
and zero protein.  In such a case, the label could state “0 fat and protein.”  This 
option would provide flexibility and might save a little label space for other 
purposes. 
 
A question in Notice 237 about the nutritional disclosures specifically calls out 
whether a final rule would have competitive effects.  As explained in Section 1 
above, the connection between mandatory nutritional disclosures and traditional 
notions of competition are not clear and, indeed, replacing competition with a 
uniform government mandate is not typically viewed as a pro-competitive policy.  
But the differential burden that the regulations proposed in Notice 237 will place on 
large versus small businesses will further tilt the playing field towards big producers 
and high-volume brands.  The rule as proposed would apply equally to small-batch 
products and would require expensive testing (whether by an outside lab or in-
house using costly equipment) for some, “non-standard,” products.  As such, there 
can be no doubt that Notice 237 as written favors high-volume products that can 
spread the cost of compliance across larger revenues from a particular brand. 
 
Another question asks whether a final rule would burden small producers.  As 
explained in Sections 2 and 3 above, mandatory nutritional labeling rules will, even 
as promulgated with broad tolerances and a five-year implementation date, place a 
burden on small businesses.  We urge TTB to revisit the question of an exemption or 
different rules for small-batch products or small businesses to alleviate this 
burden. 
 
 
34 See ATF Ruling 80-3. 
35 See generally 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. 11 
 
 
 
 
6. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports TTB’s 
Objective Standard Approach, but Burdens Remain36 
 
The Brewers Association has long advocated for objective and realistic labeling 
tolerances for small producers.  Subjective tolerances leave industry members 
guessing about their compliance obligations.  And tight tolerances inherently favor 
large producers, who can afford the machinery for tighter production runs and 
possess the equipment necessary to test and adjust batches (e.g., by adjusting 
water addition, as is commonplace in high-gravity brewing) to meet labeled values.   
 
For the reasons above, the Brewers Association applauds the +/- 20% tolerance 
proposed in Notice 237 for calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  The tolerance 
is easily understood and does not leave brewers guessing about whether they are in 
or out of compliance.  And, as already noted, a 20% tolerance is broad enough to 
allow many (but not all) malt beverages to provide compliant label disclosures 
using “typical value” charts that do not require sophisticated equipment or outside 
testing.  
 
The Brewers Association also applauds the broader tolerance of +/- 1% ABV for 
labeled alcohol content on malt beverage and beer labels.  For most malt beverage 
and beer products, a 1% ABV tolerance allows for compliant disclosures using 
simple measurements, such as hydrometer measurements, and straightforward 
calculations.  Departure from the existing 0.3% standard is overdue. 
 
We wish to emphasize, however, that even the expanded and objective tolerances 
will not allow reliable measures for the growing number of innovative brewery 
products made with unusual ingredients or employing unusual processes.  Adding 
fruit, fruit puree, or fruit juice to a malt beverage has become commonplace in the 
past decade and a half.  The addition of such materials, and many others (e.g., 
chocolate), make reliance on a “typical value” chart unreliable.  Indeed, as Notice 
237 itself notes, the proposed tolerances allow calculations or average value tables 
to work only for “standard products.”37  A great many malt beverages – roughly 30% 
based on the last year of COLA approvals – cannot reliability use typical values or 
simple calculations to comply with the nutritional disclosure requirements of 
Notice 237. 
 
7. The Brewers Association Supports Mandatory Alcohol Content Labeling 
for Beer and Malt Beverages, Within a +/- 1% ABV Tolerance38 
 
The Brewers Association has long supported alcohol content labeling for malt 
beverages, provided adequate tolerances are permitted.  Assuming a +/- 1% ABV 
 
36 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.3., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. 
37 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. 
38 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.4. & 5., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6669. 12 
 
tolerance, as proposed by Notice 237, we accordingly support the proposed 
mandatory alcohol content labeling rule for malt beverages and non-FAA Act beer.39 
 
Alcohol content information helps consumers understand the alcoholic strength of 
a beverage so that they can better regulate their intake.  Alcohol content 
information is also well-understood by consumers, as it has been mandated on all 
distilled spirits and most wines for nearly a century.  Thus, unlike untested 
proposals for “standard drink” and similar labeling, alcohol content is a concept 
that consumers know and understand.  Helping consumer regulate their alcohol 
intake using information on alcohol-by-volume will require no education and faces 
no “learning curve.” 
 
Although we support mandatory alcohol content labeling, we also wish to underline 
that adopting the rule will not be cost-free for small brewers for the reasons 
explained in Sections 2 and 3 above. 
 
Notice 237 asks whether a +/- 1% ABV tolerance is potentially misleading 
consumers.  We do not think so.  From a consumption standpoint, 1% ABV is simply 
not enough alcohol to make a material difference in the intoxication of a person 
consuming anything but absurd volumes of a malt beverage or beer.  For a beer 
drinker to consume the equivalent in alcohol of one extra average-strength beer 
(5.0% ABV), that drinker would have to consume five beers, all containing more 
alcohol up to the maximum tolerance allowed, in a compressed amount of time.  
Such a consumer would already be intoxicated by any reasonable measure, 
regardless of the 1% ABV variance. 
 
In addition, multiple policies of TTB already permit added small amounts of alcohol 
without a precise label disclosure, and those policies have not caused issues with 
the public’s ability to control their consumption.  Malt beverages labeled “non-
alcoholic” may contain almost .5% ABV.  And many non-alcohol products (e.g., soft 
drinks) contain small amounts of alcohol, provided they remain under .5% ABV.  In 
both examples, existing policy does not seek to disclose or regulate such de 
minimis amounts.  We see nothing misleading about a 1% ABV tolerance.  Sadly, it 
is not surprising that advocates for the largest multinational brewers seek a tighter 
tolerance, as a tight tolerance imposes costs on small brewers and accordingly 
provides large companies with a competitive advantage. 
 
On the subject of alcohol statements, the Brewers Association was disappointed 
that Notice 237 does not contain any proposal to overhaul and modernize TTB’s 
 
39 In the case of beer products falling outside TTB’s FAA Act jurisdiction, we see a legitimate question 
as to TTB’s authority to mandate such disclosures, although we do not oppose them on policy 
grounds.  Notice 237 asserts that mandatory alcohol content labeling for non-FAA Act beers (a 
category including most fermented hard seltzers) is warranted as a means to protect the revenue and 
enhance revenue collection.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667.  We think this reasoning strains credulity.  
After all, and as already noted, alcohol beverage labels already contain numerous indicia that the 
products they identify are, in fact, alcoholic products subject to the federal excise tax.  Among other 
things, the mandatory Government Warning Statement would tip oƯ any taxpayer or TTB auditor 
about the presence of a taxable level of alcohol. 13 
 
outdated regulations on the labeling and advertising of “non-alcoholic” and 
“alcohol free” beverages.40  As TTB knows, consumer interest non-alcoholic beer 
has grown substantially in the past 7-8 years, and sales are increasing.  In January 
2020, the Brewers Association petitioned TTB to update its regulations governing 
such products, asking for common-sense changes in-line with the current market 
and consumers.  TTB’s failure to act on the petition for over five years cannot be 
explained.  We renew our call to modernize the regulations on labeling and 
advertising such products. 
 
Notice 237 inquires about where the alcohol content statement should appear.  In 
the case of malt beverage regulated under the FAA Act, if TTB mandates broader 
nutritional label disclosures on labels, then placement of alcohol content within the 
statement of other serving facts makes sense.  For added flexibility, however, we 
think industry members should have the option of placing alcohol content 
elsewhere on the label, provided that the information meets the regulations’ 
general requirements like those for prominence, minimum type size, and contrast.41 
 
8. TTB Should not Mandate a Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces42 
 
The concept of measures-of-alcohol-per-container labeling is unfamiliar to U.S. 
consumers.  This puts such information in marked contrast to familiar concepts like 
net contents and alcohol-by-volume measures.  The Brewers Association 
accordingly does not support a mandate for a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces 
and, if TTB proceeds with some of Notice 237’s disclosures, urges TTB to remove 
the alcohol in ounces requirement from any final rules. 
 
Consumers interested in moderating their intake understand that total alcohol 
intake is a function of volume and alcohol content.  As TTB regulations have 
mandated net content information for many decades, and many FAA Act-regulated 
products (all distilled spirits, most wine, some beer) have had to display alcohol 
content for many years, this is a control method familiar to consumers.  We are not 
aware of any significant confusion in using these measures. 
 
But labeling with a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces can lead to significant 
consumer confusion.  TTB’s labeling regulations, and those of its predecessors, 
have always put a premium on telling consumers the nature of the beverage in the 
container.43  Labeling that reduces all alcohol beverages to a single number will only 
tend to confuse consumers into viewing all alcohol beverages as the same.  This, of 
course, is not the case – each category (and indeed, class and type) of alcohol 
beverage has its own unique properties.  One-size fits all obscures this reality in a 
misleading manner. 
 
 
40 Currently at 27 C.F .R. § 7.65. 
41 See 27 C.F .R., Part 7, Subpart D. 
42 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.6., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6671. 
43 See, e.g., Statement of Joseph H. Choate, Jr., Hearings on HR. 8539 Before the Committee on Ways 
and Means, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935), at 10 (Act would provide the consumer with ""all the 
important factors which were of interest [to them] about what was in the bottle”). 14 
 
Of course, we believe the proponents in favor of alcohol in fluid ounce labeling aim 
for exactly the sort of confusion noted above.  The distilled spirits industry has long 
advocated for equating all alcohol beverages under a variety of slogans:  “A drink is 
a drink”; “equivalency”; etc.  Adopting this rhetoric will embrace a position in a 
longstanding policy debate that Congress, to date, has not embraced.  TTB should 
not make this leap. 
 
Notice 237 asks if its disclosures should reference the concept of a “standard 
drink” or otherwise reference the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans.  The Brewers Association would see such references as a substantial 
error.  As TTB knows, the Dietary Guidelines are updated every five years.  Indeed, as 
these comments are written,44 substantial uncertainty surrounds what the next 
iteration of the Dietary Guidelines (for 2025-2030) will have to say about alcohol.  
TTB should not require a labeling rule subject to revision – requiring costly new 
labels and other burdens on government resources and the industry – every five 
years. 
 
The proposed statement of alcohol in fluid ounces represents a significant and 
untested departure from longstanding policies designed to help consumers of 
alcohol beverages moderate their consumption.  TTB should remove this feature 
from any final mandatory disclosure rule. 
 
9. If Regulations are Adopted, a Linear Display and Partial Disclosure via 
Electronic Means Both Present Sound Options for Minimizing Regulatory 
Burdens45 
 
Should TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the Brewers Association 
supports the current proposal to permit industry members to display those in a 
linear display.  We do not view a text box as a significant improvement in visibility, 
and such a requirement would require far more extensive re-designs of industry 
member labels.  The Brewers Association also urges TTB to re-consider its decision 
not to permit nutritional disclosures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) by 
electronic means, as such a system would reduce burdens on industry and 
government, provide greater flexibility, and facilitate the export of U.S.-made 
products. 
 
A linear display gives producers more flexibility in designing their labels and avoids 
what would otherwise amount to a mandate for front-and-back labeling of 
products.  TTB’s experience is instructive – “light”/“lite” beer has been on the 
market for 45 years bearing the same nutritional information as proposed in Notice 
237.  Calories and carbohydrates constitute a central aspect of the inter-brand 
competition between such products.  Yet the statement of average analysis on a 
light beer appears in a linear display without any evidence, to our knowledge, that 
such information does not reach consumers, many of whom choose light beer 
precisely because of its reduced calories and/or carbohydrates.  We fail to see why 
 
44 In August 2025. 
45 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.7., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6672-73. 15 
 
a text box is needed when decades of experience demonstrates that a linear display 
is sufficient.  
 
Moreover, the amount of space on a beer label is quite finite.  Adding a mandatory 
text box will take up substantial room on the label and would force some producers 
to re-tool their labeling in order to accommodate the added space.  A brewer 
packaging in bottles, for example, might need to add back-labeling capabilities in 
order to accommodate an added text box.  Conversely, because the space on a 
beer bottle or can is limited, it seems hard to believe that consumers will struggle 
locating a linear display of nutritional information. 
 
Notice 237 asks whether TTB should abandon the maximum type size limitation on 
alcohol content statements for malt beverages.  We wholeheartedly agree with 
such a repeal.  As Notice 237 recognizes, alcohol content is important information 
to some consumers, helping them to regulate their alcohol intake.  The type size 
limitation appears to be a vestige from before the Supreme Court’s Rubin v. Coors 
decision,46 when the FAA Act prohibited alcohol content statements on malt 
beverages.  It is well-past the time to do away with the remnants of this paternalistic 
approach to malt beverage consumers. 
 
We also renew our call for TTB to provide for the electronic disclosure of nutritional 
information as an option for the industry.  An electronic disclosure option would 
strike the right balance between consumer transparency and avoiding undue 
burdens on businesses, especially small businesses.  TTB’s own figures show that 
even among groups with comparatively “low” access to smart phones, that access 
already reaches over three-quarters of the population.  According to the Pew 
Research Center, as of last year 91 percent of all American adults have smart 
phones, and 98 percent have a cell phone of some kind.47  Those numbers will only 
grow in the future.  Notably, the Pew Research data shows that smartphone 
penetration is lowest (at a still substantial 79%) among persons over 65 years of 
age, who tend to own non-“smart” cellphones in greater numbers.48  Today’s 65+ 
cohort, with their relative resistance to smartphone technology, will shrink over 
time.  Indeed, as the nutritional disclosures mandated by Notice 237 will not likely 
become mandatory until six or seven years after the close of the current comment 
period, smartphone ownership will likely be near-universal by the time any 
regulations become effective. 
 
An electronic solution disclosing nutritional information via QR code would ease the 
burden of Notice 237 on small businesses.  A QR code can accommodate 
variations of a recipe, whether inadvertent or deliberate, without the need to design 
and order new labels.  The brewer would simply update information linked to the QR 
code, saving substantial resources.  A QR code disclosure option also would permit 
brewers to provide this information in different formats (e.g., in European 
 
46 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995).

https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/ (last visited August 10, 2025). 
48 See id. 16 
 
measures) for different markets without the need to redesign labels.  This would 
help boost the competitiveness of American-brewed beer in foreign markets. 
 
10. If Regulations are Adopted, Reference Amounts Should be Adjusted to 
Reﬂect Typical Serving Sizes of Beer49 
 
The Brewers Association believes Notice 237 needs to adjust its proposed 
reference sizes for malt beverages, specifically the five-ounce reference size for 
products between 7% and 16% ABV.  Reviewing the proposed reference sizes, 
Notice 237 appears to embrace sizes more appropriate for wine products in this 
alcohol content range. 
 
The Brewers Association agrees that a 12-ounce reference size is appropriate for 
beer containing not more than 7% ABV.  But the standard twelve-ounce beer serving 
persists for stronger products than 7% ABV.  Most craft brewers have a retail 
component to their business, selling beer directly to the public.  Visiting almost any 
craft brewery will confirm that they do provide smaller pours for products 
somewhat above 7% ABV.  The dividing line, however, generally is set around 8% 
ABV.  We accordingly urge TTB to apply the 12-ounce reference amount to products 
containing not more than 8% ABV instead of 7% ABV. 
 
In addition, in observing the service of beer at craft breweries across the country, 
products in the 8% ABV to 16% ABV range are often served in different sizes, 
generally consistent with strength.  For products 8-12%, we believe an eight-ounce 
reference amount more accurately reflects the most typical pour size.  Then, for 
products containing more than 12% ABV but not more than 16% ABV, the five-
ounce reference amount proposed by Notice 237 appears appropriate.  For the 
strongest products, the Brewers Association agrees with Notice 237’s proposal of a 
two-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products in the above 16% to 24% ABV 
range, and a one-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products above 24% ABV. 
 
The Brewers Association does not see any merit in tying recommended serving sizes 
to any concept like a “standard drink.”  As explained in Section 8, above, 
concerning fluid ounces per drink, this concept is unknown to the American 
consumer.  Moreover, what constitutes a “standard drink” may be influenced by the 
Dietary Guidelines.  As such, the label rule might require revaluation every five years 
as the Dietary Guidelines evolve.  Industry needs more certainty than that. 
 
11. If Regulations are Adopted, we do Not See the Need to Further 
Complicate the Regulations with Speciﬁc Dual-Column Rules50 
 
The Brewers Association would not oppose the voluntary use of dual-column 
labeling by an industry member, provided that the information it displays is truthful 
and not misleading.  But we do not see a reason to further complicated the 
regulations with specific instructions governing what is simply the presentation of 
 
49 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.9., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. 
50 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.10., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. 17 
 
truthful, accurate, and specific “other information” on a label – something the 
existing malt beverage regulations already authorize.51 
 
Notice 237 asks whether a voluntary “dual column” rule should be allowed on 
containers containing 200-500% of the referenced amount or on containers 
containing 200-300% of the referenced amount (the FDA rule).  We believe such 
complexity is unnecessary, and producers should be able to choose either, so long 
as the information provided is truthful, accurate and specific.  Greater complexity 
with a rule governing a voluntary labeling decision will only serve as a “trap of the 
unwary.” 
 
12. If Regulations are Adopted, a Five-Year Implementation Period Will Help 
Mitigate its Impact on Small Businesses52 
 
Should TTB finalize a nutritional labeling rule, the Brewers Association supports a 
five-year compliance date.  Many small brewers update their labels at least once 
every five years, reducing the added cost burden of a final rule.  Nevertheless, some 
small and independent brewers will need to redesign labels outside their usual 
process.  In our survey of members, roughly one-third indicated that at least some 
of their labels do not change within a five-year cycle.  Another roughly one-third 
suggested that label redesigns are rare or infrequent but with less clarity on number 
of years, suggesting a longer time cycle for at least some of their labels. 
 
The Brewers Association also supports Notice 237’s proposal to allow the addition 
of nutritional information without the need for a new COLA.  Submitting and 
receiving label approval for a new COLA takes time and effort, and most small 
businesses do not have dedicated staff for such tasks.  Eliminating the need for this 
regulatory step would save both government and industry resources. 
 
Finally, today small and independent brewers, along with most of the alcohol 
beverage industry, face the prospect of three new federal labeling mandates: 
 
 The nutritional, alcohol content, and possibly other disclosures 
contemplated by Notice 237;  
 
 The mandatory allergen disclosures contemplated by TTB Notice 238;53 and 
 
 For alcohol beverages falling under FDA’s primary labeling jurisdiction, a 
front-of-label packaging mandate contemplated by FDA Docket No. FDA–
2024–N–2910.54 
 
The prospect of implementing different labeling changes at different times is 
daunting to any industry member, but particularly to small producers.  The Brewers

Association accordingly urges TTB to coordinate any implementation date for 
Notice 237 with the mandatory effective date of any final allergen regulations 
flowing from TTB Notice 238 and any FDA front-of-package mandate applicable to 
alcohol beverages.

Comments of the Beer Institute Regarding NPRM 237
This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 237, by which the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, 
calorie, and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels 
subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).
BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer 
importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more 
than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is 
committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal 
responsibility.
Brewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency
The beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, 
consumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to 
transparency through the Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading 
brewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to 
consume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling 
2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content 
and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program 
has been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest 
brewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an 
unparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers 
make responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences 
between distinct types of alcohol beverages.
As a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB 
Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If 
TTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and 
already well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could 
cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance 
costs would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already 
complies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.
What follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.
1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to 
consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the 
proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?2
B I  R e s p o n s e :  “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term 
“Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving 
Facts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, 
calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts 
descriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance 
costs by altering a widely used disclosure.
2. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens 
by requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” 
statement?  
BI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly 
for many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling 
2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.
3. Are consumers  accustomed  to ﬁnding  nutrient  content  information  in a Serving  Facts 
statement?  
BI Response: For over a decade,  many brewers  have voluntarily  included  the Serving  Facts 
statement  on their labels.
4. Would  changing  the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause  confusion?  
BI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  
reflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol content expressed as 
alcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure  placement  should  also be flexible  – either  as part 
of a Servings  Facts disclosure  or elsewhere  on the label, and the widely  understood  
abbreviation  “ABV” should  be permissible.
5. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish  
alcohol  beverages  from  other  food  items?  
BI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  
reflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol  content.  It is 
unnecessary  to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish  alcohol  beverages  from other food 
items,  as there are other sufficient  indicators  that the product  contains  alcohol  on the label. 
6. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement 
should be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to 3
the statement on a mandatory or optional basis. 
BI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ 
pledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. 
For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding 
nutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary 
packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard 
for disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and 
appropriate descriptor for these disclosures. 
7. TTB  speciﬁcally  seeks  comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling 
requirements with regulations  issued  by FDA,  as updated  in 2016.  
BI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for 
nutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage 
products (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics 
of alcohol beverages.
8. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any 
micronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that 
their disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB 
should require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients  on alcohol  beverage  labels.  
BI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom 
present in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be 
optional. 
9. TTB also seeks comments  on whether  certain  nutrients  should  be listed only if present  at 
speciﬁc  levels.  TTB is proposing  to require  the listing  of calories,  carbohydrate,  fat, and protein  
content  on alcohol  beverages,  even if the product  does not contain,  or contains  only a de 
minimis  amount  of, these components.  However,  TTB speciﬁcally  seeks comments  on whether  
fat and protein,  which  are not typically  found  in certain  alcohol  beverages,  should  be listed only 
if present  at speciﬁc  levels.  If so, what levels  should  trigger  these requirements?  TTB also seek 
comments  on whether  any other nutrients,  such as sodium,  caffeine,  or sugar,  should  be 
required  to be listed if present  at a speciﬁc  level, even if they do not otherwise have to be 
disclosed. 
BI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, 
and there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry 4
and understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or 
sugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.
10. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with 
the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?  
BI Response : No.  FDA  labeling  requirements  address  wider  public  policy  goals  for  the  
broader  food  category.  Requiring  a Nutrition  Facts  Label  on alcohol  beverage  products  
would  be overwhelming  relative  to the  limited  scope  of nutrient s in alcohol  beverages.  
11. Do the differences  between  alcohol  beverages  and other foods  make it 
unnecessary,  or even misleading,  to adopt  the type of nutrient  labeling  required  on food labels  
that are under  FDA’s labeling  jurisdiction?  
BI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol 
beverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also 
the answer to Items #12 and 13 below.
12. Would  information  on the percentage  of the daily value of the listed nutrients  
provided  by alcohol  beverages  be useful  information  for consumers?  
BI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of 
listed nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically 
consume alcohol beverages for nutrient value. 
13. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead 
consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their 
daily nutrient requirements? 
BI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do 
not consume  them for nutritive  value.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  restrict  or prohibit  health  
claims  concerning  alcohol  beverages .
14. For  greater  consistency  with  the  FDA  Nutrition  Facts  Label,  should  Alcohol  Facts  
statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) 
or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
BI Response : Statements  of Average  Analysis  and  Serving  Facts  labels  allowed  by TTB  
Ruling  2013-2 , and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have  long  been  in use,  are  5
familiar  to consumers,  and  provide  consumers  with  the  information  they  need  about  
alcohol  beverages.  Any  additional  information  should  be voluntary.
15. Would  the inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  to be found  in alcohol  
beverages  (such as trans-fat  and dietary  ﬁber) be useful  or potentially  misleading?  
BI Response : The inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  in alcohol  beverages  is of 
no utility  and could  be confusing  to consumers.  
16. Should  TTB allow numerical  statements  of the vitamin  and mineral  content  of 
alcohol  beverages,  assuming  the product  contains  vitamins  or minerals,  or could  such a 
statement  create  an erroneous  impression  that consumption  of the alcohol  beverage  has 
nutritional  value or other health-related  beneﬁts?  
BI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do 
not consume  them for their vitamin  or mineral  content.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  prohibit  
health  claims  for alcohol  beverage  products .
17. How many industry  members  already  provide  nutrient  content  information  on 
labels,  in advertisements  (such as websites),  or upon request  (for example,  to consumers  or 
restaurants)? 
BI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest 
brewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with 
twelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and 
nutrient content information on request.
18. Do  consumers  want  to see  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  on alcohol  beverage  products?  
How  might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information 
about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include  
Alcohol  Facts  labeling?  How  do those  beneﬁts  compare  to the  costs  and  regulatory  burdens  
associated  with  such  revisions?  
BI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling 
80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other 
alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer 
and VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became 
mandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently 
accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, 
compliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the 6
marketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.
19. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the 
alcohol  beverage  market?  
BI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI 
believes enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market. 
20. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, 
in particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace? 
BI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already 
includes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s 
proposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering 
the alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended 
time basis, should help with planning and execution.
21. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect  
international  trade  of alcohol  beverages?  
BI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to 
alter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year 
implementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, 
nutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these 
labeling requirements. 
22. TTB is proposing  to modify  the tolerances  set out in the 2020 guidance  by 
eliminating  references  to ""reasonable  ranges""  based  on ""good  manufacturing  practice  
limitations.""  Instead,  TTB is proposing  an objective  standard,  which  allows  a tolerance  of 20 
percent  either  above  or below  the labeled  amount  for calories,  carbohydrates,  protein,  and 
fat….  TTB seeks comments  on whether  the proposed  tolerances  are broad  enough  to facilitate  
reliance  on databases  for standard  products,  among  other methods  for calculating  calorie  and 
nutrient  content,  but still speciﬁc  enough  to provide  accurate  information  to consumers.  
Speciﬁcally,  TTB seeks comments  on whether  it should  instead  propose  the same tolerances  set 
forth in TTB Procedure  2020-1  or whether  another  approach  should  be considered.  
BI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several 
years. Its continued application is appropriate. 7
23. For beers that are not deﬁned  as “malt beverages”  under  the FAA Act, TTB is proposing  
to mandate  an alcohol  content  statement  on the label of the products  under  TTB’s IRC authority.  
However,  these beers would  not be subject  to the proposed  Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements,  
including  the requirement  for a statement  of the number  of ﬂuid ounces  of pure ethyl alcohol  per 
serving,  because  the Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements  are being proposed  under  TTB’s FAA Act 
authority,  which  does not apply to these products.  Instead,  these products  are subject  to FDA labeling  
requirements.  TTB believes  that requiring  an alcohol  content  statement  on these products  would  
facilitate  revenue.  The Beer Institute  and the Brewers  Association  made  substantially  similar  comments  
in response  to Notice  No. 232. protection  by, among  other things,  making  it readily  apparent  that the 
products  are subject  to tax under  the IRC. TTB seeks comments  on this issue.  TTB also seeks comment  
on the proposal  to increase  the labeling  tolerance  to one percentage  point above  or below  the stated  
amount  for all malt beverages  and beers.  TTB seeks comment  on whether  increasing  the tolerance  for 
alcohol  content  to one percent  would  lower  the cost of compliance  for a mandatory  alcohol  content  
disclosure  and thereby  promote  competition  in the marketplace  if such disclosure  is required.  TTB also 
seeks comment  on whether  consumers  would  receive  adequate  information  about  the alcohol  content  
of malt beverages  if the tolerance  were increased.  
BI Response : Applying  a basic alcohol  disclosure  standard  – like the mandatory  and 
voluntary  standards  already  in place and adding  alcohol  by volume  to all “IRC Alcohol  
beverages”  is appropriate  and consistent  with the goals of consumer-centric  disclosures.  
Flexibility  in the location  of disclosure  is essential.  Furthermore,  alcohol  by volume  is the form 
of alcohol  content  disclosure  that consumers  recognize  and understand  across  all types of 
alcohol.  Adding  fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if 
mandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.
As for increasing  the labeling  tolerance  for malt beverages  from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues  
to caution  against  this change,  as there is substantial  risk of misinforming  consumers  about  the 
alcohol  content  of malt beverages.  If TTB believes  an increase  in tolerance  is appropriate  for 
malt beverages,  BI suggests  increasing  the tolerance  from .3% to .5%, providing  greater  
flexibility  to brewers  while still providing  accurate  information  about  the alcohol  content  they 
are consuming.  
  
24. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether 
an Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages. 
BI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-
alcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement's 
location.8
25. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a 
requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, 
on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? 
BI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is 
valuable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. 
Alcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional 
statements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither 
straightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional 
statements of alcohol content on labels. 
26. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt 
beverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small  
businesses?  
BI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to 
comply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly 
high or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (e.g., 5 years). A 
“fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater 
burden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.
27. Will the proposed  increase  in alcohol  content  tolerances  for malt beverages  
mislead  consumers?  
BI Response : An increase  in alcohol  content  tolerance  from .3% to 1.0% is too much  and 
will misinform  consumers  when  a producer  uses the full tolerance.  If TTB believes  it must 
provide  additional  flexibility,  BI recommends  only a minor  increase  in the tolerance  level, such 
as from .3% to .5%.
28. Do the proposed  labeling  requirements  for non-alcoholic  malt beverages  
adequately  advise  the consumer  that the products  contain  less than 0.5 percent  alcohol  by 
volume?  
BI Response : Yes.
29. Should  non-alcoholic  malt beverages  be exempted  from calorie  and nutrient  
labeling  requirements?  
BI Response : No.9
30. Would  an alternative  that allowed  table wines  to indicate  alcohol  content  as a 
range  (e.g., 7–14 percent  alcohol  by volume)  place less of a burden  on small wineries  and 
importers?  Would  this approach  provide  sufficient  information  to consumers?  
BI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any 
alcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.
31. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label 
if it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why?
BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts 
disclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize 
additional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.
32. Alternatively,  should  TTB allow alcohol  content  labeling  as an optional  element  of 
the Alcohol  Facts statement?
BI Response : TTB should  require  disclosure  of alcohol  content,  expressed  as alcohol  by 
volume,  on labels,  with the flexibility  of placing  it as part of a Serving  Facts disclosure  or 
elsewhere  on the label.
33. Does the placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  compliance  costs and 
regulatory  burdens?  If so, how?
BI Response : Disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  with flexibility  in placement  should  not 
materially  increase  compliance  costs or regulatory burdens.
34. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol 
Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or 
international  standards?  
BI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  
affecting  competition . However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include 
alcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format. 
35. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label 
if it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why? 
BI Response : Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts 
disclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.10
36. Should  TTB allow the use of alcohol  per serving  as an optional  element  of the 
Alcohol  Facts statement?
BI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules 
with the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition 
disclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and 
distilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that 
matches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” 
measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” 
is merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the 
reality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a 
device used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of 
communicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.
37. Does  the  placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  costs  of compliance  
and  regulatory  burdens?  
BI Response : Yes,  if the  placement  or form  of alcohol  content  information  changes.  The  
industry  is well-positioned  to continue  reflecting  Serving  Facts  information  on primary  and  
secondary  packaging  or near  the  net  contents  information  on both  primary  and  secondary  
packaging  display  panels.  However,  compliance  costs  and  regulatory  burden  will  increase  if 
the  requirements  change.
38. Does the proposal  to require  alcohol  content  information  as part of the Alcohol  
Facts statement  affect  competition  or issues  addressed  by international  trade agreements  or 
international  standards?  
BI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  
affecting  competition .
39. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving 
in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the 
consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so 
choose?
BI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not 
provide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only 
serve to confuse consumers. Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  
for a single  serving.  This reference  amount  for beer and a disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  
provide  the information  consumers  need to follow  consumption  and moderation  advice.  11
40. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving 
in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage 
manufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?
BI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the 
majority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements 
expressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse 
consumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; 
therefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection. 
41. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? 
Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?
BI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the 
simplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they 
purchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers 
already understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, 
express alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of 
providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard 
drinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between 
malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for 
all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard 
drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.
42. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms 
“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms 
should be used or defined for use on labels. 
BI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage 
labels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a 
12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to 
moderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer. 
43. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that 
information  is presented  in a linear  display?  
BI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average 
analysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since 
alcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels. 12
44. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol 
Facts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information? 
BI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern 
to the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the 
term “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, 
we would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.
45. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear 
display that is not surrounded by a box? 
BI Response: Yes. 
46. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the 
type size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels? 
BI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.
47. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, 
affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting 
requirements?
BI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other 
regulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been 
following TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs 
by changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures. 
48. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of 
alcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement? 
BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current 
minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.
49. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol 
content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well? 
BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum 
and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.
50. What alternatives  exist to convey  Alcohol  Facts information  to consumers?  13
BI Response : TTB might  consider  allowing  QR codes  for voluntary disclosures only. 
51. How, if it all, would  the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as 
compared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label? 
BI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the 
marketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the 
products they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market 
may be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for 
mandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information 
only.
52. What are the costs and beneﬁts  of aligning  Alcohol  Facts information  to 
requirements  of other countries?  
BI Response : BI sees no benefits  to aligning  nutrition  and alcohol  content  disclosures  in the 
United  States  with requirements  from other countries  with different  laws and regulatory  
structures.  The costs of compliance  and regulatory  burden  would  increase,  and consumers  in 
the U.S. may be more confused  than informed  by labeling  requirements  imported  from other 
markets.  
53. If TTB adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts labeling  for alcohol  beverages,  should  it 
include  the option  of satisfying  the requirement  by making  the information  available  
electronically,  for example  by including  a QR code or website  address  on the label to allow 
consumers  to view mandatory  Alcohol  Facts statements  on their mobile  devices  instead  of on 
the product  label?  
BI Response : Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.
54. Would  this option  provide  consumers  with sufficient  access  to Alcohol  Facts 
information  at the retail store so that they can make informed  decisions,  given issues  such as 
the need to use a smartphone,  potential  issues  regarding  the adequacy  of cellular  or Wi-Fi 
coverage  at some retail stores,  and other potential  technological  challenges?  Would  the 
provision  of mandatory  information  disclosures  via electronic  means  create  disproportional  
barriers  to access  for particular  communities?  
BI Response : Mandatory  disclosures  should  be on the label. TTB should  limit the use of 
electronic  disclosures  to voluntary  information  disclosures  only. 14
55. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via 
electronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? 
BI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means 
would decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information 
should be on the label.
56. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB 
allow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should 
some of the information be required to appear on the physical label? 
BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, 
however, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means. 
57. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, 
could the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion? 
BI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and 
alcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this 
information about all alcohol products.
58. Are the proposed  reference  amounts  a reasonably  accurate  representation  of the 
amount  of the product  customarily  consumed  as a single  serving?  
BI Response : Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  as a single  
serving.  
59. What data or other information  should  TTB consider  that would  give a better  
estimate  of the amount  customarily  consumed  for a speciﬁc  product  category?
BI Response : Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single 
serving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer. 
60. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth 
in TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages,  
regardless  of the  alcohol  content)?  Why  or why  not?  
BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single 
serving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, 
a cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for 15
accurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry 
sectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do 
not understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure 
beneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.
61. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes? 
BI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB 
Ruling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.
62. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink 
equivalent  of 0.6  ﬂuid  ounces  of alcohol,  or would  this  mislead  consumers  by not  recognizing 
how alcohol beverages are typically consumed? 
BI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is 
misleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour 
or drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that 
is more useful than the existing approach.
63. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings 
of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?
BI Response: No.
64. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, 
consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way 
in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled? 
BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 
2013-2, except to make them mandatory. 
65. Should  dual-column  displays  be allowed  on any container,  regardless  of the number  
of servings  in that container,  consistent  with TTB Ruling  2013–2? The proposed  rule would  
require  containers  with a net content  of more than 100 percent  but less than 200 percent  of a 
single  serving  size reference  amount  to be labeled  as containing  a single  serving.  TTB solicits  
comments  on whether  this is the best way to convey  the alcohol  and nutrient  content  of these 
products  to consumers.  
BI Response: There  is no good reason  to change  the current  voluntary  standards  of TTB 
Ruling  2013-2,  except  to make them mandatory.  16
66. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change 
labels? 
BI Response : It depends  on the  products.  There  are  products  in the  marketplace  with  
labels  that  have  remained  unchanged  for  several  years.  Some  of those  products  already  
comply  with  TTB  Ruling  2013-2,  while  other  labels  will  not  change  unless  the  requirements  
change.
67. How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed 
rule?
 
BI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our 
experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.
68. Will 5 years provide  enough  time for small businesses  to coordinate  labeling  
changes  required  by regulatory  changes  with labeling  changes  that are planned  in the ordinary  
course  of business?  
BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years 
is sufficient time to expect compliance.
69. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be 
2 years,  3 years,  or another  length  of time?  
BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years 
is sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate. 
70. If a ﬁnal rule is issued,  will industry  members  begin implementation  of the labeling  
changes  in advance  of the compliance  date?  
BI Response : Industry  members  are likely to begin complying  on a rolling  basis,  changing  
labels  in the normal  course  of business.  If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most 
of the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient 
time to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.
Conclusion
As noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly 
encourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as 17
outlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 
2013-2 and BI’s comments above.
If there are issues for which the TTB sought comment in NPRM 237 that BI does not explicitly address 
in this response, please consider BI’s introductory comment as the response to such inquiries.

This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 237, by which the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal responsibility.

Brewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency

The beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, consumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to transparency through the [Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI](https://www.beerinstitute.org/policy-responsibility/policy/voluntary-disclosure/)). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading brewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to consume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program has been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an unparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers make responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences between distinct types of alcohol beverages.

As a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If TTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance costs would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already complies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.

What follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.

* 1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?

BI Response: “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term “Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving Facts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts descriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance costs by altering a widely used disclosure.

* 1. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens by requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” statement?

BI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly for many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling 2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.

* 1. Are consumers accustomed to ﬁnding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement?

BI Response: For over a decade, many brewers have voluntarily included the Serving Facts statement on their labels.

* 1. Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?

BI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure placement should also be flexible – either as part of a Servings Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label, and the widely understood abbreviation “ABV” should be permissible.

* 1. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?

BI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content. It is unnecessary to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, as there are other sufficient indicators that the product contains alcohol on the label.

* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement should be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to the statement on a mandatory or optional basis.

BI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ pledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard for disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and appropriate descriptor for these disclosures.

* 1. TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling requirements with regulations issued by FDA, as updated in 2016.

BI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for nutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage products (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics of alcohol beverages.

* 1. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any micronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that their disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB should require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients on alcohol beverage labels.

BI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom present in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be optional.

* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. TTB is proposing to require the listing of calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein content on alcohol beverages, even if the product does not contain, or contains only a de minimis amount of, these components. However, TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether fat and protein, which are not typically found in certain alcohol beverages, should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. If so, what levels should trigger these requirements? TTB also seek comments on whether any other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, should be required to be listed if present at a speciﬁc level, even if they do not otherwise have to be disclosed.

BI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry and understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.

* 1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?

BI Response: No. FDA labeling requirements address wider public policy goals for the broader food category. Requiring a Nutrition Facts Label on alcohol beverage products would be overwhelming relative to the limited scope of nutrients in alcohol beverages.

* 1. Do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?

BI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol beverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also the answer to Items #12 and 13 below.

* 1. Would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers?

BI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of listed nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically consume alcohol beverages for nutrient value.

* 1. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?

BI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for nutritive value. Moreover, existing regulations restrict or prohibit health claims concerning alcohol beverages.

* 1. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?

BI Response: Statements of Average Analysis and Serving Facts labels allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2, and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have long been in use, are familiar to consumers, and provide consumers with the information they need about alcohol beverages. Any additional information should be voluntary.

* 1. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary ﬁber) be useful or potentially misleading?

BI Response: The inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected in alcohol beverages is of no utility and could be confusing to consumers.

* 1. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts?

BI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for their vitamin or mineral content. Moreover, existing regulations prohibit health claims for alcohol beverage products.

* 1. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)?

# BI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest brewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with twelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and nutrient content information on request.

* 1. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? How do those beneﬁts compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with such revisions?

BI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer and VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became mandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, compliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the marketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.

* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol beverage market?

BI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI believes enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market.

* 1. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace?

BI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already includes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s proposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering the alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended time basis, should help with planning and execution.

* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of alcohol beverages?

BI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to alter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year implementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, nutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these labeling requirements.

* 1. TTB is proposing to modify the tolerances set out in the 2020 guidance by eliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice limitations."" Instead, TTB is proposing an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat…. TTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Speciﬁcally, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set forth in TTB Procedure 2020-1 or whether another approach should be considered.

BI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several years. Its continued application is appropriate.

* 1. For beers that are not deﬁned as “malt beverages” under the FAA Act, TTB is proposing to mandate an alcohol content statement on the label of the products under TTB’s IRC authority. However, these beers would not be subject to the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements, including the requirement for a statement of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, because the Alcohol Facts labeling requirements are being proposed under TTB’s FAA Act authority, which does not apply to these products. Instead, these products are subject to FDA labeling requirements. TTB believes that requiring an alcohol content statement on these products would facilitate revenue. The Beer Institute and the Brewers Association made substantially similar comments in response to Notice No. 232. protection by, among other things, making it readily apparent that the products are subject to tax under the IRC. TTB seeks comments on this issue. TTB also seeks comment on the proposal to increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the stated amount for all malt beverages and beers. TTB seeks comment on whether increasing the tolerance for alcohol content to one percent would lower the cost of compliance for a mandatory alcohol content disclosure and thereby promote competition in the marketplace if such disclosure is required. TTB also seeks comment on whether consumers would receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance were increased.

BI Response: Applying a basic alcohol disclosure standard – like the mandatory and voluntary standards already in place and adding alcohol by volume to all “IRC Alcohol beverages” is appropriate and consistent with the goals of consumer-centric disclosures. Flexibility in the location of disclosure is essential. Furthermore, alcohol by volume is the form of alcohol content disclosure that consumers recognize and understand across all types of alcohol. Adding fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if mandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.

As for increasing the labeling tolerance for malt beverages from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues to caution against this change, as there is substantial risk of misinforming consumers about the alcohol content of malt beverages. If TTB believes an increase in tolerance is appropriate for malt beverages, BI suggests increasing the tolerance from .3% to .5%, providing greater flexibility to brewers while still providing accurate information about the alcohol content they are consuming.

* 1. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether an Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages.

BI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-alcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement's location.

* 1. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products?

BI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is valuable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. Alcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional statements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither straightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional statements of alcohol content on labels.

* 1. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt beverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small businesses?

BI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to comply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly high or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (*e.g.,* 5 years). A “fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater burden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.

* 1. Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers?

BI Response: An increase in alcohol content tolerance from .3% to 1.0% is too much and will misinform consumers when a producer uses the full tolerance. If TTB believes it must provide additional flexibility, BI recommends only a minor increase in the tolerance level, such as from .3% to .5%.

* 1. Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume?

BI Response: Yes.

* 1. Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements?

BI Response: No.

* 1. Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers?

BI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any alcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.

* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize additional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.

* 1. Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: TTB should require disclosure of alcohol content, expressed as alcohol by volume, on labels, with the flexibility of placing it as part of a Serving Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label.

* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect compliance costs and regulatory burdens? If so, how?

BI Response: Disclosure of alcohol by volume with flexibility in placement should not materially increase compliance costs or regulatory burdens.

* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?

BI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition. However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include alcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format.

* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.

* 1. Should TTB allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” is merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the reality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a device used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of communicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.

* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect costs of compliance and regulatory burdens?

BI Response: Yes, if the placement or form of alcohol content information changes. The industry is well-positioned to continue reflecting Serving Facts information on primary and secondary packaging or near the net contents information on both primary and secondary packaging display panels. However, compliance costs and regulatory burden will increase if the requirements change.

* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?

BI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition.

* 1. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?

BI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not provide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only serve to confuse consumers. Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended for a single serving. This reference amount for beer and a disclosure of alcohol by volume provide the information consumers need to follow consumption and moderation advice.

* 1. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage manufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?

BI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the majority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements expressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse consumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; therefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection.

* 1. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?

BI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the simplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they purchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers already understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, express alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard drinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.

* 1. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.

BI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage labels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a 12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to moderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer.

* 1. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that information is presented in a linear display?

BI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average analysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since alcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels.

* 1. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information?

BI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern to the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the term “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, we would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.

* 1. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear display that is not surrounded by a box?

BI Response: Yes.

* 1. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the type size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels?

BI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.

* 1. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting requirements?

BI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other regulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been following TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs by changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures.

* 1. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.

* 1. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well?

BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.

* 1. What alternatives exist to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers?

BI Response: TTB might consider allowing QR codes for voluntary disclosures only.

* 1. How, if it all, would the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as compared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label?

BI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the marketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the products they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market may be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for mandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information only.

* 1. What are the costs and beneﬁts of aligning Alcohol Facts information to requirements of other countries?

BI Response: BI sees no benefits to aligning nutrition and alcohol content disclosures in the United States with requirements from other countries with different laws and regulatory structures. The costs of compliance and regulatory burden would increase, and consumers in the U.S. may be more confused than informed by labeling requirements imported from other markets.

* 1. If TTB adopts mandatory Alcohol Facts labeling for alcohol beverages, should it include the option of satisfying the requirement by making the information available electronically, for example by including a QR code or website address on the label to allow consumers to view mandatory Alcohol Facts statements on their mobile devices instead of on the product label?

BI Response: Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.

* 1. Would this option provide consumers with sufficient access to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, given issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges? Would the provision of mandatory information disclosures via electronic means create disproportional barriers to access for particular communities?

BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the label. TTB should limit the use of electronic disclosures to voluntary information disclosures only.

* 1. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via electronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens?

BI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means would decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information should be on the label.

* 1. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB allow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should some of the information be required to appear on the physical label?

BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, however, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means.

* 1. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, could the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion?

BI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and alcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this information about all alcohol products.

* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts a reasonably accurate representation of the amount of the product customarily consumed as a single serving?

BI Response: Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended as a single serving.

* 1. What data or other information should TTB consider that would give a better estimate of the amount customarily consumed for a speciﬁc product category?

BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer.

* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol content)? Why or why not?

BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, a cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for accurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry sectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do not understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure beneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.

* 1. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes?

BI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.

* 1. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 ﬂuid ounces of alcohol, or would this mislead consumers by not recognizing how alcohol beverages are typically consumed?

BI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is misleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour or drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that is more useful than the existing approach.

* 1. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?

BI Response: No.

* 1. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?

BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.

* 1. Should dual-column displays be allowed on any container, regardless of the number of servings in that container, consistent with TTB Ruling 2013–2? The proposed rule would require containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving. TTB solicits comments on whether this is the best way to convey the alcohol and nutrient content of these products to consumers.

BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.

* 1. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change labels?

BI Response: It depends on the products. There are products in the marketplace with labels that have remained unchanged for several years. Some of those products already comply with TTB Ruling 2013-2, while other labels will not change unless the requirements change.

# How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule?

#

# BI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.

* 1. Will 5 years provide enough time for small businesses to coordinate labeling changes required by regulatory changes with labeling changes that are planned in the ordinary course of business?

BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.

* 1. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be 2 years, 3 years, or another length of time?

BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate.

* 1. If a ﬁnal rule is issued, will industry members begin implementation of the labeling changes in advance of the compliance date?

BI Response: Industry members are likely to begin complying on a rolling basis, changing labels in the normal course of business. If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most of the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.

Conclusion

As noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly encourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as outlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 and BI’s comments above.

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(Notice No. 237; Docket No. TTB–202–0005) (90 Fed. Reg. 6654 (January 17, 2025)) 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
On behalf of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), a national trade 
association representing the nation’s leading distillers of all sizes and marketers of distilled 
spirits sold in the United States, we appreciate the opportunity to comment upon the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) “Alcohol Facts” notice of proposed rulemaking and 
look forward to a thoughtful evaluation by TTB as you consider regulations on this important 
labeling proposal.  
 
As regulated producers, importers, and marketers of distilled spirits, we share the goal of TTB 
and the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act of providing consumers with meaningful 
information about the beverages they choose to purchase. It is from that shared objective that 
we respectfully submit our views regarding the instant notice and it is for those reasons that we 
do not support the Bureau's ""Alcohol Facts"" proposal as drafted either as an option or a 
mandatory requirement on container labels.  
 
Of particular note, we urge the Bureau to consider the following key points: 
• Flexibility to electronically display Alcohol Facts information is critical;  
• Anticipated costs associated will be signiﬁcant and not commensurate with the beneﬁts; 
• Standard drink metrics should be the preferred method of providing alcohol 
information; and 
• TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts in the nutrient content statements will 
create consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. 
 
It is without doubt that this notice of proposed rulemaking is one of the most signiﬁcant 
undertakings by the Bureau in the last 20 years. It is critical that TTB promulgates a ﬁnal rule 
that serves the public's interests, while also ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden 
distillers, overwhelm agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confuse consumers. We believe this

proposal, if adopted, would not meet these objectives and urge the Bureau to reconsider 
certain aspects to increase supplier ﬂexibility, reduce the ﬁnancial impact, and enhance 
consumer clarity.  
 
Below we expound on these points and provide additional context that we hope the Bureau will 
consider as it progresses with this rulemaking and its other labeling initiatives.   
 
Areas of Greatest Concern 
 
1. Flexibility to Electronically Display Alcohol Facts Information Is Critical to the Success of This 
Proposal  
 
If the Bureau wishes to ﬁnalize an actionable standard that can be accessible for consumers and 
implemented without overburdening industry members, any new regulations should, at a 
minimum, allow for the ﬂexibility to use quick response (QR) code technology or website 
references on label to provide this information. As we heard during the listening sessions and in 
the written comment period last year, the industry, both domestic and international, almost 
unanimously registered support for additional ﬂexibility, with regard to the use of QR codes or 
website references, and detailed why this ﬂexibility was warranted and necessary. DISCUS 
strongly urges the Bureau to consider introducing a QR code and/or website reference option 
into this proposal.   
 
Allowing the use of QR codes would signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬁnancial burdens for industry 
members to comply, provide eﬃciencies as they are already being utilized on bottles in the 
United States and across multiple international marketplaces for this purpose and can be geo-
tagged for individual markets, and permit producers to quickly change the information without 
needing to revise logistics and supply chain.  
 
Speciﬁc considerations regarding electronic display of Alcohol Facts information include: 
 
A. QR Codes Are Eﬀective, Consumer Friendly, and Would Not Disadvantage Certain 
Communities 
 
While we understand and appreciate that the Bureau considered the issue of QR codes in 
response to comments received during the advance notice of proposed rulemaking last year 
and decided not to include a QR code option due to a concern that it “would create barriers for 
consumer access, particularly for consumers in certain demographics and those living in rural 
areas,”
1 we believe that these perceived barriers are not as large or insurmountable as others 
have argued and that QR codes can be an accessible and sustainable source of providing 
important product information to consumers. From a consumer perspective, we believe using a 
QR code to access e-labels allows producers to provide the consumer with the requisite

August 15, 2025 
Page 3 
 
   
 
information, and in many cases, with even more fulsome detail than a physical label would be 
able to accommodate. For example, a 50 ml bottle can comfortably accommodate a QR code 
but would not be able to ﬁt the proposed label and all of the other information required by 
both federal and growing state regulations.  
 
Largely due to the rapid expansion of QR codes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic over 
the last ﬁve years, consumers have become extremely comfortable accessing important product 
information in this format for all sorts of consumer brands and services. Consumers are 
increasingly aware that much more information than is shown on the product label can be 
found by simply going to the brand’s website or scanning a QR code on the packaging. Indeed, it 
is now common for a consumer to look up a product online on their smartphone while in the 
store shopping, rather than picking up the product to examine the label. 
 
In the NPRM, TTB questions whether QR codes “[w]ould…provide consumers with suﬃcient 
access to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, 
given issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of 
cellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges.”
2 
We would argue this format of presenting information is not prohibitive for today’s or 
tomorrow’s consumer, as according to Pew Research,3 over 90% of adult Americans own a 
smartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet. In fact, many Americans can be 
considered “smartphone-dependent,” meaning digital is often the primary information pathway. 
 
Even amongst senior citizens, cellphone ownership is strong. In 2023, Consumer Aﬀairs found 
that the vast majority of seniors own cell phones (94%) or smartphones (76%).
4 Smartphone 
ownership is only expected to grow as well, with future trends predicting that the number of 
American smartphone users will increase to more than 364 million people by 2040.5 Regarding 
cell service, the three largest phone carriers today, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, each claim that 
their 4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the U.S. population, so consumers in both urban 
and rural areas should have the requisite cell service necessary to scan a QR code at the retail 
store no matter where they are in the United States. One can only expect that by 2030, when 
this ﬁnal rule would likely go into eﬀect, that these cell coverages and ﬁgures will have markedly 
increased, further closing any potential gap in accessibility for QR codes in all parts of the 
country.

Regarding concerns over those who do not own a smartphone being able to access this 
information if only available through QR code, many larger stores have scanning kiosks 
customers can use to learn more about products and consumers could always ask retail 
employees for help accessing the information as well. No method of transmitting product 
information will be 100% accessible, however, as even on-label disclosures are not universally 
accessible for every community given language barriers, literacy challenges, or consumers that 
might be visually impaired. QR code accessibility can actually help to close these gaps by 
providing product information in diﬀerent languages and allowing auditory text-to-speech 
access on devices.  
 
Our position that QR codes would be accessible and beneﬁcial for consumers is not just based 
on theory—these QR codes containing nutrient content information are currently deployed in 
retail locations across a wide variety of markets, including the United States. Based on one 
DISCUS member’s recent data, U.S. consumers are their most active QR scanning population 
across markets, making up 18% of all scanners worldwide. In December 2024 alone, over 15,000 
individuals scanned just one company’s distilled spirits QR codes in the United States.   
 
QR codes provide consumers with the ability to make even more informed purchasing decisions 
because they would potentially have access to more information than they would if information 
was limited to what was physically available on pack, given space constraints. Based on member 
experience with QR codes and electronic labels (""e-labels"") in other markets, we believe QR 
codes provide consumers with suﬃcient access to Alcohol Facts information at retail without 
creating disproportional barriers to access for particular communities. One member indicated 
that they currently utilize QR codes across their entire portfolio for consumers to access e-
labels, and they have been successfully implemented on over half a billion bottles across 166 
markets with tailor-made information in local languages to ensure consumer accessibility. These 
e-labels link to webpages that can include, for example, (i) information about the moderate 
consumption guidelines issued by regional health authorities where the QR code is scanned, (ii) 
the full list of nutritional information per portion and per 100 mL, (iii) basic information about 
the company and relevant brand for the purpose of education, and more. 
 
In that same paragraph of the NPRM referenced above, TTB “recognizes that access to 
technology and cultural norms surrounding the provision of information via electronic means 
are rapidly advancing and seeks comment on whether any ﬁnal rule should allow the proposed 
Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means.”
6 If you looked back to 
consumer QR code usage pre-2020, the numbers would look very diﬀerent to their level of 
integration and usage now. By 2030, we may experience another leap in technological 
accessibility that accelerates the consumer experience with QR codes and cements the e-label’s

role in providing valuable product information across all consumer goods. This potential 
outcome is far more likely than seeing a decrease in digitally-communicated consumer product 
information.  
 
Additionally, overcrowded labels have been shown to not be helpful for consumers and do not 
serve the need of adequately informing them regarding product details or components. This is 
especially salient for small container sizes, like 50ml bottles. Thus, requiring this additional 
information, in conjunction with other potential labelling details, such as allergens and 
ingredients, to be placed on label could have the opposite eﬀect, whereby consumers simply 
tune out all information provided. Introducing such a requirement would be especially 
burdensome for small producers. In order to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry and the 
resulting reduced choice for consumers, regulation should not be overly prescriptive in terms of 
format or compliance mechanisms. Rules should be easy to apply even for the smallest operator 
and should acknowledge the dominant mechanism consumers employ for learning about 
product information is via online searching.  
 
If the Bureau ultimately decides to allow QR code nutrient content statements, standards could 
be set requiring explanatory text to accompany the QR code on-label, as well as how the 
resulting QR code website should appear. This might provide TTB more comfort that there is a 
more uniform method of encountering this information on-label and on the ultimate landing 
page to help manage the consumer experience and expectations.  
 
B. QR Codes Promote International Eﬃciencies, Export Potential & Geo Sensitivity  
 
The ﬂexibility QR codes allow also provides important international eﬃciencies and growth 
opportunities to more U.S. distillers by allowing for greater expansion into export markets. For 
example, QR codes are sophisticated enough now to be made “geo sensitive,” allowing for 
diﬀerent languages or information to be displayed based on the location where it is scanned.  
 
This ﬂexibility would also facilitate consistency across European markets, given the newly 
implemented wine regulations and spirits commitment to place certain nutrient information on 
websites that can be accessed via a QR code on label. Other parts of the world also have 
diﬀerent requirements than those proposed in the NPRM, and adoption of this rule will increase 
the probability that U.S. labels aren't accepted into other markets, thereby requiring additional 
stickering or an even more burdensome process of relabeling bottles altogether. This, in turn, 
will cause the management of additional SKUs and label creation, which equates to additional 
cost to bring products into international markets. These amount to market barriers that 
dissuade new entrants and directly impact competition.  
 
As spiritsEUROPE notes in their comment in this docket, the EU spirits sector created an 
ambitious self-regulatory approach to provide consumers with energy information included on 
the back label and the full nutrient content information (including fat, carbohydrates and Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 6 
 
   
 
protein) made available via a QR code present on the label. spiritsEUROPE’s latest report on the 
implementation of the provision of this nutrition information from June 2024 shows that the 
share of spirits with on-pack energy information and a QR Code has grown from 0% to 70% in 
just 5 years. In addition, over 900 spirits producers in the EU have created and activated close to 
40,000 QR code labels. They report that more than 75% of all spirits volume sold will feature e-
labels by the end of 2025 and that companies are also increasingly mirroring this approach 
outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. Having this ﬂexibility in the EU to use QR codes, while 
requiring all information on-pack here in the U.S. could have very real impacts on production 
eﬃciencies and create undue ﬁnancial burdens for all companies participating in both markets.  
 
Aligning U.S. and EU requirements on displaying nutrient content information would be 
incredibly beneﬁcial for producers on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since the EU 
requirements for wine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well 
beyond the EU. Companies are already fully integrated into the QR space internationally and 
any large-scale deviation, particularly in the largest marketplace, would send shockwaves 
around the world and amongst the companies who have both U.S. and European brands.  
 
C. QR Codes Promote Sustainable Practices and Cut Down on Label Waste 
 
A QR code or website option results in production eﬃciencies for distillers that provide this 
information in multiple markets around the world and also allows for greater ﬂexibility in 
making any necessary changes to the nutrient or ingredient information. With on-label 
declarations, if anything changes in the product formulation, it would require a large-scale 
logistical eﬀort to reprint the labels that can take years to implement, swap out product in the 
marketplace, and change marketing campaigns. Whereas with information provided via a QR 
code or website, a change can be completed in real time with no physical waste through a 
simple revision of the text on the webpage.  
 
These options help reduce unnecessary waste—allowing for this digital labeling could help save 
hundreds of thousands of labels, point-of-sale materials, and other marketing materials from 
being sent to the landﬁll anytime a product formulation changes. From a design and 
sustainability perspective, our members aim to reduce the size of paper labels across all 
products to minimize the materials used and impact on our environment. Utilizing QR codes 
instead of Alcohol Facts statements would help producers avoid the need to create larger labels 
and thus a larger volume of materials needed.  
 
Having the ability to display this information through a digital solution allows for a more even 
distribution of competition in the marketplace. Industry members can quickly pivot in the digital 
space, providing real time information to the consumer. Label inventory management can be 
better controlled since there wouldn't be a need for obsolescence of labels when there are 
changes to alcohol facts (e.g. a sugar reduction project which may only aﬀect calories and

carbohydrate values). A digital solution also reduces the chances of there being multiple labels 
in market for the same brand as it goes through a reformulation. This, in turn, helps avoid 
consumer confusion when they see labels with diﬀerent values side by side. 
 
Other areas of growing interest to consumers such as sustainability-related information on the 
product or re-use/recycling information can also easily be integrated into digital labels. For 
example, in Italy, mandatory recycling information for glass bottles may be provided in a geo-
localised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels. This is increasingly important even 
domestically, as diﬀerent states adopt environmental or sustainability regulations requiring 
certain label declarations. These eﬃciencies add up to keep the beverage alcohol industry aﬂoat 
and help smaller producers maintain their business amidst ever-changing regulations.   
 
For these reasons, we respectfully request the Bureau allow producers the option of utilizing a 
QR code or website reference to display any nutrient content information mandated by this 
proposal.  
 
2. The Anticipated Costs Associated with This Proposal Will Be Signiﬁcant and Not 
Commensurate with the Beneﬁts 
 
DISCUS and its members greatly appreciate the Bureau’s thorough and detailed cost analysis 
outlined in the NPRM and eﬀorts to keep potential costs down for industry members, 
particularly for smaller participants in the marketplace. TTB’s decision not to require product 
testing and to provide a robust implementation period will go a long way to reducing the 
potential cost burden on producers resulting from this rule. However, the anticipated ﬁnancial 
impact of this rule cannot be overlooked, as it will still be signiﬁcant and potentially unbearable 
for some marketplace participants, especially given the current economic downturn in the 
industry. Flexibility for producers, including the ability to utilize QR codes or website references, 
is critically important and would blunt much of these anticipated ﬁnancial hardships and allow 
for a more reasoned implementation of this proposal.  
 
A. Diﬃcult Moment in the Spirits Industry to Introduce Additional Regulatory Burdens 
 
The distilled spirits sector, and overall beverage alcohol industry, is currently dealing with a 
multitude of headwinds and external constraints, which have resulted in a constricting and 
increasingly diﬃcult marketplace in which to operate. The slowing post-pandemic marketplace 
has hampered U.S. spirits industry revenue, which decreased by $424M in 2024—a 1.1% year 
over year decline
7—and these trends have only continued in 2025. According to the National 
Beverage Alcohol Control Association (NABCA), in control states, spirits dollar sales are down 
1.4% annually in the 12-month period ending in May 2025.

Mexico have also declined 16% in April and 18%9 in May in terms of dollar value compared to 
same month a year ago and, from March through the end of April, sales of U.S. spirits in Canada 
plummeted more than 66%10, highlighting the growing trade-related challenges for the industry.  
 
Operating a craft distillery already comes with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risks—with small margins, 
intense competition, distribution obstacles, challenges building brand equity, rising production 
and materials costs due to inﬂation and tariﬀs, and the daily responsibility of welcoming visitors 
to your distillery and tasting room and keeping your staﬀ paid on time. This economic 
environment has only exacerbated the ﬁnancial constraints on craft distilleries around the 
country. A quick Google search can highlight the sheer number of craft distilleries that have 
closed or ﬁled for bankruptcy over the last several years, as they contend with these broader 
marketplace challenges, which have resulted in craft spirits sales declining by volume and value 
in 2023 for the ﬁrst time.11  
 
Even the larger multinational producers are contending with these economic headwinds by 
downsizing staﬀ, selling oﬀ assets like brands and sites, and even pausing production at 
distilleries around the world. The beverage alcohol industry has been navigating a challenging 
market for the last few years and is being further impacted by ongoing trade disputes. Staﬀ at 
beverage alcohol companies, already dealing with team reductions in many cases, are also 
being tasked with navigating increasingly burdensome regulatory requirements, such as 
extended producer responsibility (EPR) initiatives across a number of states. With the larger 
companies simply trying to keep up with these evolving requirements, smaller producers are at 
a distinct disadvantage as they most likely do not have internal compliance expertise and thus 
need to engage costly outside consultants. 
 
Given these myriad of challenges, it’s not hyperbole to posit that the adoption of this proposal 
with the assumed costs discussed in the NPRM could lead to the closure of even more craft 
distilleries and further attrition throughout the industry. The distilled spirits sector truly cannot 
withstand any additional unplanned regulatory expenditures. 
 
B. Existing Voluntary Commitments Will Not Actively Reduce Potential Relabeling Costs  
 
While TTB mentions that many industry members are already providing nutrient content 
information related to their products, which they argue should reduce overall costs for the 
industry, this information is often being provided through a host of diﬀerent means and formats 
so label redesign will be inevitable for essentially all producers. The NPRM references the 
DISCUS Serving Facts Commitment as one such initiative. The DISCUS Commitment directs

members to provide “Serving Facts” information in either of the currently approved TTB formats 
(either serving facts panel or statement of average analysis) located either on the product label 
or on a company website with an on-label QR code or website reference.  
 
Many DISCUS members elected to include this information via QR code or website reference to 
achieve the eﬃciencies detailed above. While they now have this nutrient content information 
publicly available online, our members would need to redesign their labels to include the 
statement along with the rest of the industry. TTB states in the NPRM that their cost estimate 
model “assumes that 100 percent of brand name products can coordinate a regulatory label 
change with a regularly scheduled label change within two years.”
12  We can say from 
experience that this assumption is false. Even for the DISCUS commitment, members needed at 
least a two-year runway to eﬀectuate the QR code and website revisions, even with many 
companies already having much of the information for the products and a QR code on their 
labels that could be repurposed for this commitment. This NPRM would be a much heavier lift 
to implement and would take substantially longer for companies to eﬀectuate.  
 
Even if the proposed revisions to the Serving Facts label are adopted, such as the title change to 
Alcohol Facts and the mandated ABV and ﬂuid ounce information, those producers with a 
voluntary Serving Facts label on their products will need to redesign every label to 
accommodate this new format. Every beer, wine, and spirits producer will need to incur some 
form of label redesign and printing costs, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of 
nutrient content information.  
 
For a coordinated labeling change (changes that can be coordinated with scheduled changes), 
TTB “estimates the costs per universal product code (UPC) would be $1,636.52 and for an 
uncoordinated distilled spirits labeling change over a ﬁve-year period it would be $10,427.36.”
13 
Even if we accept this cost estimate for a coordinated label change, some of our member 
companies have had thousands of active COLA registrations over the last 20 years and most 
have diverse portfolios of wine, beer, and spirits products that would all need to be relabeled. It 
is clear that this proposal is likely to cost the industry millions of dollars—on the low end—and 
could potentially hamper future innovation or personalization in label design with the prospect 
of increased costs and decreased ﬂexibility. TTB recognizes the potentially severe ﬁnancial 
implications of this proposal when they “estimate the one-time total relabeling costs associated 
with this proposed rule to be approximately $214 million (or $43 million per year) assuming a 
compliance date of 5 years.”
14  
 
The costs estimated by the Bureau most likely fall short of the actual costs of implementing this 
proposal and pose an unreasonable burden on industry members. Allowing ﬂexibility and a 
cost-eﬀective option in QR codes or website references is the only way that distilled spirits

producers across the board can aﬀord to provide nutrient content information to consumers at 
this present time. The beneﬁts of having the nutrient content statements on label as opposed to 
accessible through a QR code are not worth imposing these types of burdensome costs on 
producers attempting to stay aﬂoat and keep their staﬀ employed.  
 
C. Voluntary Testing Costs Should Be Included in TTB’s Cost Estimates   
 
DISCUS agrees that the Bureau should be including the cost of voluntary testing in their cost 
analysis estimates. While testing is thankfully not required in the proposal, industry members 
will likely choose to test some of their products, either initially upon development or routinely 
as batches or formulas change to ensure accurate reporting of the nutrients on label. The 
testing frequency and ultimate cost would vary depending on the size of the company, brand 
portfolio, and characteristics of the particular distilled spirits plant and/or production line.  
 
Most distillers are small businesses and are not familiar with nutrient calculations, and any 
additional compliance burdens can quickly become expensive hurdles for smaller players in the 
industry. For example, many craft distillers may have to hire consultants or companies to handle 
these label/formula elements for their brands, adding costs that they cannot aﬀord in an 
already constricting and diﬃcult marketplace. As we heard from small distillers in the ﬁrst 
comment period on these topics last year, even the act of redesigning and reprinting labels to ﬁt 
this additional information will prove costly, as many do not design these in-house, with some 
distillers in the listening sessions predicting it would cost them thousands of dollars to comply. 
While many craft distillers may utilize calculation methods and databases to prepare their 
nutrient content information, there will be a signiﬁcant proportion of them that will not have 
the time or resources necessary to learn how to integrate these tools and will feel obligated to 
send their products oﬀ to the lab for testing—often, as TTB notes in the NPRM, at several 
hundred dollars per test at many of the preeminent industry labs.  
 
TTB themselves state that “[i]f…industry members will continue to send each product 
formulation for analytical testing each year, the ongoing annualized cost of the proposed rule 
would be approximately $64 million.”
 15 Even spread out over the vast numbers of distillers, 
brewers, vintners, and importers in the United States marketplace, this recurring cost would 
place an unnecessary burden on producers who are simply trying to comply with this regulation 
and ensure their data is accurate.  
 
D. Potential for Signiﬁcant Burdens and Impacts on TTB Staﬀ  
 
When considering new labeling proposals, it is critical to also ensure that any new regulations 
do not overburden TTB staﬀ or create confusion for industry members, consumers, and the 
Bureau alike. While this proposal would thankfully not require the submission of additional  
 
15 90 Fed. Reg. at 6682. Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 11 
 
   
 
certiﬁcates of label approval (COLAs) to facilitate the inclusion of the nutrient content 
statements, the Bureau still has the daunting task of ensuring industry compliance with the rule.  
 
Unfortunately, we understand that the Bureau has undergone signiﬁcant attrition (over 20% 
agency wide) over the course of this year in response to the whole of government staﬀ 
reductions and early retirements, and that TTB is unable to backﬁll any vacancies due to a 
federal hiring freeze until at least October. As a result, TTB staﬀ are being asked to do more with 
less and would have a diﬃcult time implementing and enforcing additional regulatory 
responsibilities under these circumstances. While we would like to think TTB will have their 
staﬃng and budgetary apportionments raised over the next few years, there is no indication 
that this will be the case, and the Bureau should reassess the proposal through this lens. 
 
Even before the staﬀ losses in 2025, TTB, as a whole, had been experiencing signiﬁcant levels of 
attrition over the last several years, including losing roughly 15% of their workforce from 2020-
2022 through a combination of retirements and other departures.
16 This substantial attrition 
has also been seen in the Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD) with the staﬀ tasked 
with conducting these label and formula reviews. Adding increased label or formula 
components will necessitate specialist review and experience and, thus, has the potential to add 
substantial burdens for TTB staﬀ and delays for industry members in the review and approval 
processes. The Bureau has demonstrated considerable positive gains in this area over the last 
decade; delays and label returns have the potential to undo some of this progress, as they have 
signiﬁcant impacts on product timelines and can upend routes to market, seasonal product 
releases, state brand registrations, marketing campaigns, and production schedules. 
 
If mandatory nutrient labeling is implemented, TTB will need to assess how to approach current 
labels in the marketplace and how to ensure industry member compliance with the rules, both 
of which will inevitably lead to complicated implementation and procedural questions. Will TTB 
staﬀ have the bandwidth and technical expertise to assess and review nutrient content 
statements for accuracy? What’s to stop a bad actor from simply including arbitrary numbers on 
their labels? While it’s not cost eﬀective or feasible for TTB to test each product to ensure 
accuracy, there surely must be the need for some oversight and market compliance programs in 
place, which will deplete the Bureau’s budget and staﬀ time. These technical considerations 
could potentially increase burdens on TTB staﬀ and industry members alike and need to be 
thoroughly contemplated during this rulemaking process.  
 
E. This Proposal May Be Inconsistent with Recent Deregulatory Executive Orders 
 
Another consideration the Bureau will need to assess as they prepare a ﬁnal rule is the 
deregulatory priorities of the Trump Administration. In the Trump Administration’s Executive 
Order on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” (January 31, 2025), agencies have been 
 
16 2023 Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Annual Report, pg. 65, available at 
https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/ttbar2023.pdf. Ms. Amy Greenberg

Page 12 
 
   
 
directed to identify at least 10 prior regulations for elimination for each new regulation issued, 
as well as to “ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed 
regulations, being ﬁnalized this year, shall be signiﬁcantly less than zero.”  
 
Given the Bureau’s own extensive and substantial cost estimates included in the NPRM, it 
remains to be seen how this proposal could be ﬁnalized in its current form and comply with the 
directives of this Executive Order. There has been no proposal to eliminate any regulations to 
oﬀset these new proposed regulations, which would need to be carefully evaluated. Further, 
TTB should evaluate any potential unintended consequences of eliminating regulations that 
industry has become accustomed to and supports, as it could lead to other signiﬁcant issues. 
The distilled spirits industry generally supports our regulatory structure, and we have based our 
entire business models around the current set of regulations. Doing away with 50 regulations, 
for example, to implement this proposal could introduce a host of uncertainty and confusion.  
 
We respectfully suggest that oﬀering compliance ﬂexibility to regulated entities will be key to 
achieving that balance. Complicated and costly rules could be diﬃcult for industry members to 
understand and properly comply with. Providing industry members with several avenues to 
comply with the regulations would be useful, given the various label designs, container sizes, 
international markets, and existing commitments that would be impacted by these regulations 
throughout the industry.  
 
3. Standard Drink Metrics Should Be the Preferred Method of Providing Alcohol Information 
 
DISCUS urges the Bureau to maintain its existing position related to the disclosure of ﬂuid 
ounces of alcohol in Serving Facts statements. Listing the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving is 
an optional declaration under Ruling 2013-2 and should remain optional under this new 
scheme. Mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per 
serving by itself on every beverage alcohol product could be confusing for consumers and not 
useful in helping them follow beverage alcohol moderation guidance.  
 
Consumers will be confused how the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol relate to a particular serving of 
alcohol, so a consumer education campaign would be necessary if it were required to appear on 
every label. And, unfortunately, standard labels do not have enough space to clearly articulate 
the signiﬁcance of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. If producers wish to include it voluntarily as part of a 
broader statement, however, along with standard drink information, the option should be 
available to further educate consumers about the particulars of a standard drink.  
 
In lieu of mandatory information related to the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving, DISCUS 
supports the inclusion of standard drink information, either through text or the use of an icon, 
as part of any Alcohol or Serving Facts statement. Consumers have far more familiarity with 
standard drink terminology than with the calculation of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. And the  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 13 
 
   
 
inclusion of standard drinks along with a recommended serving size will communicate 
information that facilitates responsibility, in a manner that is consistent with general consumer 
understanding. 
 
Since 1985, information about standard drinks has been a key part of the Dietary Guidelines for 
American’s guidance on moderate consumption. Government experts and public health 
organizations – in the U.S. and worldwide – have long recognized the importance of providing 
standard drink information. The Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, in 
consultation with health experts around the nation, consistently have deﬁned a standard drink 
in the various editions of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as containing 0.6 ﬂ. oz. (14 
grams) of alcohol. Also provided in the Dietary Guidelines are examples of standard drink 
equivalents, such as 12 ﬂ. oz. of 5% ABV regular beer, 5 ﬂ. oz. of 12% ABV wine or 1.5 ﬂ. oz. of 
40% ABV (80 proof) distilled spirits. 
 
Consumers have become accustomed to framing their responsible consumption practices 
around these drink measurements. DISCUS believes inclusion of standard drink information in 
relation to serving size nutrient content information will be a beneﬁcial tool for consumers and 
suggests that an icon might be the most eﬀective way to communicate this, whether it is 
through a QR code scan or on label. An example of icons that TTB could look to emulate are 
those currently in use in the Australian market:  
 
 
These icons clearly communicate to the consumer the approximate number of standard drinks 
present in each package. We believe this might be the most eﬃcient and consumer friendly 
method to display alcohol per serving information, and TTB should explore mandating a 
standard drink icon if they seek to ﬁnalize this proposal.  
 
In the NPRM, TTB also queries whether labels should include a summary of the Dietary 
Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking that would be updated based on any changes in the 
guidelines over time. Although we support consumer education when it comes to moderate 
alcohol consumption, DISCUS does not support including moderate drinking guidance from the 
Dietary Guidelines on spirits labels, given that this information would take up additional label 
space and can change with the issuance of each new edition. The standard drink information or 
icon suﬃciently provides responsible consumption information. And, if information can be 
provided via a QR code, the landing page would have space to provide information on the 
Dietary Guidelines and can include a link to the Guidelines, themselves.

4. TTB’s Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts in the Nutrient Content Statements Will 
Create Consumer Confusion, Damage Brand Equity, and Impede Innovation 
 
We respectfully submit that TTB's proposed approach to ""serving sizes"" as a basis for the 
Nutrient Content Statement is ﬂawed: mandating proposed serving sizes (based on Ruling 
2013-2) for many current and future products would be confusing to the consumer and 
damaging to brands, as it is contrary to how it is intended to be enjoyed. It will also impede 
innovation based on consumer trends, such as the current trend to provide lower ABV options. 
TTB’s proposed serving sizes seem to be centered around the assumption that the only means 
of drinking a wine, beer, or spirits product is straight, unmixed with other beverages. While this 
may be mostly true for wine and beer products, it most certainly is not the case for distilled 
spirits products, which often serve as “ingredients” in a wide-range of cocktails. Accordingly, it is 
imperative that producers have more ﬂexibility in deﬁning the serving size for each product.  
 
The terminology “serving size” communicates to the consumer that this is the recommended 
serving that they should be consuming. TTB states that these serving size reference amounts are 
intended “only as a basis for the consumer to determine alcohol, calorie, and nutrient intake 
and not as a recommended consumption amount.”
17  Most consumers will not understand this 
distinction and will rightly assume that the serving size listed on the bottle refers to the 
recommended amount that the consumer should pour into a serving. If the stated serving size is 
5 oz., the consumer will believe that a normal serving for that product is 5 oz. This could be 
misleading and damaging to the brand equity for these brands and inadvertently lead to the 
consumption of more alcohol. A few examples of this confusion and damage to brand equity are 
outlined below.  
 
First, there are many liqueurs, cordials, and specialty products currently on the market that 
producers recommend be enjoyed in a 2oz pour (sometimes as part of a cocktail), but would fall 
into a 5 oz. required serving size in the current proposal. Recommending a 5 oz. pour would 
make the experience less enjoyable and may turn a consumer oﬀ from the product altogether. It 
would also increase the recommended amount of alcohol and calories, which is not the desire 
of producers or consumers, and we do not believe is the goal of the present rulemaking. The 
stated ABV cutoﬀs simply do not align with traditional serving sizes or how the manufacturer 
would recommend that many products are consumed.

.37

Page 15 
 
   
 
Second, there is also a growing trend to oﬀer lower ABV versions of popular products. If there is 
a rigid serving size requirement based on ABV, there could be an unintended consequence of 
forcing a lower ABV product into the 5 oz. serving size which could have a greater amount of 
alcohol than the original full proof product with a serving size of 1.5 oz. See the example below, 
whereby the current requirements would have the unintended consequence of recommending 
a serving size for the lower ABV version that has 25% more alcohol than the serving size for the 
regular full-strength product.  
 
Product Serving Size Standard Drink (Per USDG) 
Full proof product – 40%

ABV 
5 oz. Serving Size (per 
proposal) 
1.25 
 1.5 oz. Serving Size (per 
producer recommended 
serving) 
0.38  
 
There has been growing interest in lower ABV alternatives to consumers’ favorite products and 
mandating this rigid serving size protocol will certainly chill innovation in that space and no 
doubt other future areas of consumer choice that have yet to materialize.  
 
Third, the proposed serving sizes will create confusion in the increasingly popular Ready-to-
Drink (RTD) space, as there are a variety of ABVs and intended serving suggestions. For example, 
two nearly identical products – one at 7% ABV and one at 8% ABV – that are intended to be 
enjoyed in a similar fashion could result in a very diﬀerent suggested serving, with impacts to 
the suggested alcohol and caloric intake.

Instead of mandating the 2013-2 serving sizes, we urge the Bureau to oﬀer producers the option 
to recommend the appropriate serving size for the product and not be forced to display serving 
sizes that may not ﬁt every type of product. This option is complementary to our suggested 
inclusion of standard drink information, which would clearly communicate the serving size as it 
is intended to be enjoyed, as well as the amount of alcohol in that serving in the context of the 
standard drink (which as discussed above, will be easier for consumers to understand).  
 
Speciﬁc Comments on Other Aspects of the Proposal 
 
Questions/Issues: 
 
I. Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement  
 
With regards to the proposal to amend the title of the beverage alcohol information statement, 
we do not see a reason to alter the existing “Serving Facts” terminology and merge these 
statements under the “Alcohol Facts” moniker.  
 
Consumers readily understand the terminology of “Serving Facts” and have been encountering 
these statements on beverage alcohol products for over a decade now. Altering the title of 
these statements now could lead to consumer confusion, especially considering that the title of 
“Serving Facts” better describes the nature of the information being presented to the consumer 
and that most producers, if looking to include additional consumer information on label, have 
opted to utilize the Serving Facts statement over the existing Alcohol Facts statement.   
 
As such, our members have indicated that a mandated change in the terminology to “Alcohol 
Facts” would increase compliance costs for products already containing a “Serving Facts” panel, 
as every label with a voluntarily ""Serving Facts"" statement would need to be revised. They 
would incur ﬁnancial impacts for creating new print plates, printing new labels, and writing oﬀ 
costs for ""Serving Facts"" labels that could no longer be used. One member indicated that this 
change would aﬀect over 1,000 labels in their portfolio that would need to be revised from 
""Serving Facts"" to ""Alcohol Facts."" 
 
Switching the terminology to “Alcohol Facts” would obscure the main purpose of providing this 
information to the consumer, which is to share the nutrient content information related to a 
serving of the product. We urge TTB to maintain the longstanding “Serving Facts” terminology. 
 
II. Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information 
 
A. A Host of Nutrient Content Information is Currently Available to Consumers  
 
As we detail in our submission last year, many spirits producers currently voluntarily provide 
nutrient information to consumers. In 2022, DISCUS Members committed to provide consumers Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 17 
 
   
 
with nutrient content information, such as serving size, number of calories and grams of carbs, 
protein, and fat per serving size, through either of the currently TTB-approved formats (Serving 
Facts panel or statement of average analysis) on new labels by June 2024.18 This information is 
now available for all spirits products distributed in the United States by DISCUS Director 
Members, either displayed directly on the label or via a URL or scannable QR code on the label.  
 
The majority of multi-national producers also provide nutrient content information on their 
brand and corporate websites to satisfy voluntary commitments made in other markets, such as 
in Europe, as well as on some e-commerce platforms at the point of purchase.  
 
Beyond what distillers provide directly, many governmental and private websites also provide 
serving fact information for categories of standards of identity, which generally do not vary 
dramatically across brand given the strict requirements on production, ingredients, and alcohol 
content. For example, the USDA FoodData Central database includes information for general 
categories of beverage alcohol. The page for “Alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof” 
provides that 1 ﬂ. oz. contains 64.2 kcals.
19 As with most spirits products, the value for most of 
the other nutrients for that product, including protein, fat, and carbs, is zero.   
 
B. Harmonizing Nutrient Labeling Requirements with FDA Would Be Inappropriate and 
Overly Burdensome 
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks for the industry’s views on whether they should seek greater 
harmonization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on nutrient content statements 
and if TTB should adopt FDA’s Nutrition Facts panel. DISCUS strongly supports TTB’s 
longstanding jurisdiction over beverage alcohol labeling and the Bureau’s approach to nutrient 
content labeling and opposes adoption of the FDA’s nutrition labeling scheme.  
 
We believe that the many diﬀerences between distilled spirits and other non-alcohol beverages 
make it unnecessary and even misleading to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on 
food labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction. One major concern is that listing the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients on an alcoholic beverage label could 
mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on beverage alcohol consumption to satisfy 
part of their daily nutrient requirements. There is no daily recommendation/Dietary Reference  
  
 
18 DISCUS Director Members announced this voluntary commitment to provide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products 
as part of the 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. The commitment by DISCUS Director Members to 
provide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products empowers consumers to make healthy choices and foster environments 
that enable people to make informed decisions. This commitment did not extend to DISCUS Craft Members, who may not have 
as many resources to dedicate to calculate and conform this information to TTB required speciﬁcations. It also does not extend 
to limited-run test products available on-site at production facilities and tasting rooms.

Intake for alcohol. Distilled spirits producers would not in any way want to make that implication 
on our brand labels and strongly oppose the inclusion of daily values on TTB-regulated 
products.  
 
On this point, it’s important to note that no other country requires daily value information for 
listed nutrients on distilled spirits labels, so this would be a departure from common global 
practices. Over the past ﬁve years, our members indicated they have not received any consumer 
inquires for many of these nutrients, such as fat (including saturated fat and trans-fat), sodium, 
protein, and cholesterol. This experience demonstrates that this information is not relevant to 
beverage alcohol products or consumers and should not be required to be listed on labels. 
 
DISCUS also opposes mandated inclusion of any additional components that the FDA may 
require, like sodium, as they would not provide any value to the consumer given their typically 
low or non-existent levels in beverage alcohol products.  
 
The adoption of FDA nutrition facts labels on TTB-regulated products would also impose 
signiﬁcant costs and burdens on industry members as it would require extensive testing and a 
complete overhaul of existing labels, whereas the proposed statements could be implemented 
with less disruption to label portfolios. Requiring a full FDA nutrition facts table would take up 
even more space on already limited labels and hamper competition throughout the industry. 
 
Additionally, unlike most food and beverage products, spirits undergo a rigorous pre-approval 
process at TTB for their labels and formulas to ensure compliance with the Bureau’s rules and 
regulations. This pre-approval process is unique in relation to products by the FDA, where there 
is no pre-approval process before products can enter the marketplace. Beverage alcohol 
products under the FDA’s purview contain the full FDA nutrition and ingredients label, but they 
are not required to go through the same pre-approval process as those regulated by TTB and 
are only subject to post-market sampling enforcement eﬀorts to ensure product compliance and 
safety.  
 
As part of its pre-approval process, TTB reviews every proposed label submission for all distilled 
spirits products, with a particular focus on whether the product meets its identiﬁed class/type 
and does not mislead consumers about the nature of the product. Through this review, TTB also 
essentially signals that spirits labels in the marketplace contain accurate and understandable 
information that consumers can rely on to make their purchasing decisions.  
 
The mandate of any additional information—either through TTB’s proposed statement or an 
FDA nutrition facts label—will inevitably be complicated by the pre-approval process and should 
be carefully evaluated through that lens. In particular, there will be acute complications if 
information is required to be presented on the label (rather than via scannable QR code or URL)  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg

and if the longstanding acceptable practice of providing ingredient ranges for formulas is 
disallowed or compromised through the adoption of an FDA-like system of labeling ingredients 
in order of predominance.  
 
Reasonable timelines for formula and label approvals are key to manage industry member 
production, marketing, and state registration requirements. Additional delays or complications 
in this process could cause undue ﬁnancial hardships for industry members—hardships that 
other food and beverage products do not face in the FDA process with no prior approval. Testing 
for nutrients, particularly if an FDA nutrition facts label was required, would be cost prohibitive 
for the majority of industry members and would create signiﬁcant burdens on their operations. 
This is particularly true for innovators that release several new brands or limited releases each 
year. Formula ranges have been allowed for decades and shifting this policy now would create 
havoc for every industry member who has a formula currently approved with the TTB, as these 
would need to be revisited and altered.  
 
C. Sugar Content Statements Should Remain Optional 
 
In its NPRM, TTB proposed to allow optional sugar content statements as part of the Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statement. DISCUS supports the optional inclusion of sugar content statements, 
consistent with the current approach, and agree with its inclusion in the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement if provided.  
 
D. Inclusion of Micronutrients Should Remain Optional 
 
DISCUS strongly suggests that micronutrients should remain an optional inclusion. In most 
instances, micronutrient values would be zero and would not provide consumer beneﬁt to being 
included in the Alcohol Facts statement but might cause consumer confusion.  
 
E. Spirits Products Should Have the Ability to List Only Nutrients Present in the Product 
 
We can appreciate the Bureau’s response to our previous comment on this topic in the NPRM 
that “[w]hile certain alcohol beverages are unlikely to contain certain nutrients, such as fat or 
protein, even the absence of these components provides information and may be of interest to 
consumers.”
20 While some consumers certainly may be interested in seeing the absence of 
those components on the label, we believe the vast majority of consumers are well aware that 
whiskey or vodka products, for example, do not contain any fat or protein. These nutrients are 
not commonly associated with distilled spirits products, unless they contain cream or other 
such ingredients. Allowing the listing of calories alone on label for products without any other 
nutrients would also align the U.S. with the EU marketplace, creating additional eﬃciencies for 
exporters.  
 
 
20 90 Fed. Reg. at 6665. Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 20 
 
   
 
At a minimum, TTB should consider allowing producers to employ a short-hand version of the 
statement for products containing only calories that identiﬁes the absence of other nutrients, 
without having to print the entire statement with only zeros. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein 
should only be required to be included on label to the extent they are actually present in the 
product at certain levels. 
 
F. Vitamin or Mineral Statements Should Be Prohibited 
 
The distilled spirits industry strongly opposes the inclusion of vitamin or mineral statements on 
labels. We believe that including numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of 
alcohol beverages could create an erroneous impression to consumers that the consumption of 
beverage alcohol has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts, or is part of their daily 
dietary needs. We know TTB strictly enforces potential health claims under the current 
regulations and allowing vitamin or mineral statements will only lead to increased confusion 
around health claims for both consumers and the Bureau. As such, we strongly recommend 
against including such a numerical statement.  
 
III. Calculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels 
 
In this NPRM, TTB proposes modifying the tolerance levels outlined in TTB Procedure 2020-1 by 
eliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice 
limitations"" and shifting to an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20% either above 
or below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. DISCUS supports this 
proposal.  
 
The proposed 20% above or below the labeled amount is reasonable and broad enough to 
facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating 
calorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to 
consumers. Further clariﬁcation would be welcomed, however, on how the tolerance might 
apply for products making speciﬁc calorie claims (e.g. ""only 100 calories.”) 
 
The ability to continue to rely on databases and this updated tolerance will be critical for 
industry compliance with this proposal. Relying on databases and calculators allows industry 
members to provide nutrient content information without conducting costly and burdensome 
laboratory testing on each of their products, particularly for brand extensions that might have 
variation in ABV from bottle to bottle, such as bottled-in-bond or barrel strength whiskies. TTB’s 
continued recognition that databases and calculation methods can accurately determine 
nutrient content information is appreciated and will help lessen burdens associated with this 
proposal and increase eﬃciencies with international markets.

IV. Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on all Alcohol Beverage Products  
 
While we do not support mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl 
alcohol per serving by itself on every beverage alcohol product, we fully support and applaud 
the Bureau's proposal to require the disclosure of the alcohol content, expressed as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), for all beverage alcohol products both under its 
jurisdiction and FDA’s. By this action, TTB will ﬁnally require all regulated alcohol products to 
bear an alcohol content statement, which has long been required for all distilled spirits 
products. There’s no rationale to exempt certain beverage alcohol products from declaring their 
alcohol content on label while others are required to do so and the Bureau’s action will ensure 
consumers can be increasingly aware of the alcohol content of their alcohol beverage of choice.  
 
Importantly, TTB also proposed to mandate alcohol content labeling on non-alcohol beverage 
products, which DISCUS greatly supports. As the non-alcohol beverage space continues to 
become more popular, industry would welcome guidance on labeling requirements since many 
of these products may straddle TTB and FDA labeling requirements. Ambiguity in this category 
and proper regulatory authority has resulted in inconsistent labeling practices across the 
marketplace. 
 
V. Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement 
 
As raised by the Bureau in the NPRM, we respectfully request that the alcohol content 
statement not be mandated as part of an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement and that the 
alcohol by volume statement on the brand label remain the primary alcohol content statement 
required. Distilled spirits consumers are accustomed to interacting with ABV information in the 
same ﬁeld of vision as other mandatory information on the front of most distilled spirits bottles, 
so moving the required statement onto an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement could lead to 
consumer confusion or inconvenience. If this change was adopted, consumers will not, in most 
cases, readily be able to see the ABV statement while perusing product at a retail location as 
they will need to turn container to look for the ABV disclosure in the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement.  
 
Given that this would be an enormous departure from how distilled spirits labels have 
historically been organized, TTB does not provide suﬃcient rationale in the NPRM for why the 
Alcohol or Serving Facts statement is the appropriate mandatory location for this information or 
why a currently optional declaration under the voluntary scheme outlined by TTB Ruling 2013-2 
is now becoming required. Current Serving Facts panels under the voluntary scheme are only 
required to list serving size, servings per container, calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  
 
If information related to serving size and the number of standard drinks per serving are included 
in the Alcohol or Serving Facts panel, this information is adequate, in terms of what a consumer 
needs to help inform their responsible consumption. If the ABV is already stated in another Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 22 
 
   
 
location on the product, the producer should have the option and ﬂexibility to include it in an 
Alcohol or Serving Facts statement if they choose to do so. Producers wanting to maintain their 
current label design and placement of the ABV on the front of the label should not be burdened 
with displaying the same information twice on their label in order for it to be compliant with 
this new scheme.  
 
VI. Linear Display and Type Size of Alcohol Facts Information  
 
A. Proposed Linear Display Increases Flexibility and Should Not Require a Box 
 
DISCUS appreciates the inclusion of a linear display option for the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement, as this will increase the ﬂexibility for industry members in how they choose to 
display the mandated information based upon their speciﬁc label characteristics and available 
space. There is no reason to believe that the linear display option would be diﬃcult for 
consumers to understand or locate on label, as TTB has essentially permitted a similar 
statement for over 20 years. Consumers have become accustomed to engaging with statements 
of average analysis since the Bureau approved them in 2004 and, while they do not include all 
of the information outlined in this proposal, they do provide all of the nutrient content 
information included in the Serving Facts format, without a box surrounding the statement. 
Given the similarities between this linear display and statements of average analysis, consumers 
should be able to easily locate and understand this information.  
 
DISCUS urges the Bureau to revise the proposal to make the box around both the linear and 
panel display Alcohol Facts statements optional. Given the amount of information being 
provided in the statement, consumers will have no trouble locating these statements on the 
label. The box is another element that adds complexity to designing labeling that meets all 
mandatory requirements with limited space availability. The Bureau allows this ﬂexibility now, 
as many Serving Facts statements are provided on label without a box around them, and they 
are just as recognizable for consumers. TTB also pre-approves every label and will retain the 
option to send a COLA back for correction if a specialist felt a producer was trying to obscure or 
hide an Alcohol Facts statement. Industry members should be given maximum ﬂexibility to 
decide how to best implement this proposal for their products - whether with a linear or panel 
display, as well as where it is located on label.  
 
B. Formatting and Type Size Requirements 
 
DISCUS agrees with TTB’s proposal that, if required on label, the type size for an Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statement should be consistent with the existing mandatory disclosures. While 
pertaining to beer and wine products only, DISCUS also supports the elimination of the 
maximum type size limitation. 
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 23 
 
   
 
C. Cost Estimates for Linear Display  
 
While we discuss the anticipated cost of this proposal in depth above, we would like to stress 
that, even with a linear display allowance, each label will need to be reviewed and readjusted to 
ﬁt this additional information. For those labels that are space constrained, dielines would have 
to increase for the inclusion of the Alcohol Facts statement, which could have a detrimental 
environmental and sustainability impact. Every statement option aside from a QR code would 
pose a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden to update all product labels to include Alcohol Facts 
statements. Among the on-pack options, the linear display format will impose the least burdens 
for industry members because it takes up much less space, in what is already a limited area for 
many of our products. This ﬁnancial impact would also decrease if the box around the linear 
and panel displays was made optional, as producers could then ﬁt the required information into 
even more space on the label.  
 
VII. Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display 
 
DISCUS agrees that the dual-column alcohol facts panels should remain optional. We also agree 
with TTB’s proposal to allow the dual-column format on alcohol beverages sold in containers 
holding at least 200 percent and less than 500 percent of the serving size reference amount, as 
this would more accurately reﬂect the way in which alcohol beverages are bottled and labeled 
and how producers might want to utilize these panels. 
 
Education may be needed, however, around the meaning of dual-column labels for the 
consumer to correctly read and understand dual-column labels and to understand how the 
manufacturer is intending the consumer to approach the servings shown. It’s possible that dual-
column displays could create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol 
beverage at once or in one sitting is expected or recommended. In other regions, such as the 
EU, most companies only provide nutrient content facts per 100mL measurements. With so 
many diﬀerent serving sizes and container sizes in the US, it would be practically very diﬃcult 
for companies to implement a dual-column display for every bottle size and SKU.  
 
In addition, if TTB does not allow Alcohol or Serving Facts statements to be provided by QR 
codes, the amount of space required to print dual-column panels information can impact 
already limited label space availability, so allowing producers the option of including a dual-
column display at their discretion rather than requiring it provides essential ﬂexibility.  
 
VIII. Implementation Period 
 
Thousands of brands will be aﬀected by this initiative, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the global commerce in beverage alcohol products and the multitude of products that 
are imported into the United States, DISCUS appreciates the ﬁve-year phase-in period included Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 24 
 
   
 
in the proposal and believes that this implementation timeframe should be suﬃcient to 
eﬀectuate the necessary labeling and branding changes. 
 
This length of time will be essential to address label development and redesign, along with the 
associated resources and outside expertise required in a label initiative aﬀecting the industry. 
DISCUS appreciates the Bureau not requiring resubmission of COLAs to include Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statements, as this would greatly increase burdens throughout the industry and 
for the Bureau’s ALFD staﬀ by creating a tidal wave of applications. A ﬁve-year phase-in 
timetable for compliance provides a more orderly transition period across a company's brand 
portfolio - be it a large, medium or small portfolio and/or with ""fast moving"" or ""slow moving"" 
brands. This timeframe would allow companies to transition to new labeling requirements in a 
structured manner, which would beneﬁt all stakeholders. 
 
Even with this ﬁve-year implementation period, exceptions would need to be considered for 
legacy products or products that have aged in bottle (e.g., ice wine, etc.). A waiver or other 
mechanic should be in place to help protect investments that may not comply. Further 
clariﬁcation is also needed regarding the exact mechanics of the ultimate compliance date and 
which products it could impact that are already in the marketplace. Would it only be applicable 
to new products produced after the ﬁnal rule goes into eﬀect? What about inventory sitting 
either in a warehouse or on a store shelf? Would existing inventory need to be reworked to 
comply with the ﬁnal rule? These important questions demonstrate the realities producers will 
need to contend with if this proposal is ﬁnalized, as well as the type of questions the Bureau 
should be prepared to respond to either in the rule language itself or an accompanying FAQ 
guidance document.  
 
In the NPRM, the Bureau asked how frequently labels are changed on beverage alcohol 
products, and the answer truly diﬀers based on producer and brand. Each brand is unique in 
the frequency that labels are changed. While not always the case, generally speaking, straight 
spirits brands change product labels less frequently than formulated products or certain 
categories like ready-to-drink (RTDs). A shorter amount of time to comply than the proposed 
ﬁve years isn't realistic given the uniqueness of each label. Each label size will need to be 
analyzed and possibly reworked to provide enough space for the inclusion of an Alcohol Facts 
statement. Labels may have to increase their dieline to meet the requirements, which from an 
environmental and sustainability practice introduces additional burden to the industry.  
 
Companies that choose to comply earlier obviously would be free to do so and, if QR code 
transmission was permitted, we believe you would see a host of companies able to comply in 
very quick order given the ease of updating or changing information hosted on those webpages. 
If required on label, however, some of our members indicated that they would opt to begin to 
include the required information as a brand goes through a redesign or is being updated. This 
would reduce the amount of times a label has to be touched, thus helping to reduce the cost 
associated with updating a label, but would result in a slower roll-out than if there was more Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 25 
 
   
 
ﬂexibility. Our members relayed that they would need to begin taking steps towards the 
implementation of the labeling changes right away in order to become compliant before the 
compliance period begins in ﬁve years. 
  
We also urge the Bureau to synchronize the implementation of any mandatory labeling changes 
so that industry members are able to comply with these new requirements in the most eﬃcient 
manner. This would include not only the mandatory allergen labeling requirements, but also 
any ingredient labeling proposal the Bureau might be considering.  
 
While we understand that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking related to ingredient 
labeling was withdrawn earlier this year prior to its release, if the Bureau intends to revive it in 
another form, it’s critical to note that any eventual ingredient labeling requirements being on a 
diﬀerent implementation track would be ﬁnancially and logistically devasting for industry 
members large and small. It would be unreasonable to ask industry members to undergo costly 
label redesign to include nutrient content and allergen information and begin production on 
those new labels across all their product lines, only to be notiﬁed they will need to restart label 
redesign to incorporate ingredient information in a couple years. We respectfully request that 
TTB consider this important point as they seek to ﬁnalize these pending rulemakings and 
prepare their future regulatory agenda.  
 
Conclusion and Summary 
 
DISCUS supports TTB’s objective to provide consumers with clear, consistent information about 
alcohol. It is critical that the ﬁnal rule serves the public's interests, without placing undue 
burden on distillers, overwhelming agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confusing consumers. We 
believe this proposal, if adopted as-is, would not meet these objectives, and we urge TTB to 
reconsider certain aspects.  
 
We request greater ﬂexibility in terms of how and where the Alcohol Facts information is 
provided. Most critically, we propose the option to include it via QR codes or links. This 
approach: 
• Ensures broad consumer access (e.g., QR codes/links in advertising) and readability (e.g., 
multiple languages for non-English speakers);  
• Oﬀers the ability to provide consumers with up-to-date, detailed information, while 
accounts for small product/label space limitations;  
• Reduces burden on producers, especially craft distillers, who are already facing 
economic headwinds; 
• Allows producers to be nimble in responding to labeling changes and/or geographical 
diﬀerences (e.g., bottle return) and, thus, minimizes waste; and 
• Aligns with labeling in other regions of the world, including the EU, which results in 
greater consistency and can reduce potential trade barriers. 
 Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 26 
 
   
 
DISCUS recommends that Alcohol Facts information specify the number of standard drinks 
per container – potentially via a graphic alongside text that states the number of servings. The 
inclusion of standard drink information better aligns with consumer understanding than the 
proposed requirement to list the amount of pure alcohol in grams, which could result in 
consumer confusion. 
 
DISCUS has concerns regarding the signiﬁcant anticipated costs associated with this proposal, 
which are not commensurate with the stated beneﬁts. TTB’s own cost estimates anticipate 
implementing this Alcohol Facts proposal will cost producers millions of dollars in label redesign, 
marketing, logistics, and printing expenditures, at a time when the industry is constricting and 
unable to absorb these unbudgeted costs. Allowing for ﬂexibility in transmission of this 
information will enable broad industry compliance.   
 
DISCUS believes TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts for the nutrient content 
statements will create consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. 
The Ruling 2013-2 serving sizes do not appropriately ﬁt with consumer understanding around 
traditional pours for many products and misrepresent serving sizes for many liqueurs and lower 
ABV products. Allowing ﬂexibility for producers to provide their recommended serving size 
when a prescribed one does not neatly ﬁt is required if this proposal were to be adopted.   
 
* * * * * 
 
America’s distillers and marketers of spirits want to ensure that consumers have access to the 
information they need, but this proposal leaves several important issues unaddressed and 
opens distillers up to potential costs that might be insurmountable in the current market. We 
implore TTB to carefully evaluate all potential implications of this proposal to avoid undue 
burden on distillers and TTB staﬀ, as well as any inadvertent consumer confusion. We believe 
ﬂexibility and clarity will be the key to ﬁnding a balanced approach.   
 
Thank you again for providing an opportunity to discuss this important topic and we look 
forward to liaising with the Bureau on these matters going forward. If you have any questions 
regarding our submission, please do not hesitate to reach out.  
 
Best regards,

 RE:   ACSA’s  Comments  on  Notice  No.  237  Alcohol  Facts  Statement  in  the  Labeling  
of
 
Wine,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages
 
 
[Submitted  electronically  on  https://www.regulations.gov]  
 
Introduction  
This  is  a  challenging  time  for  U.S.  small  businesses,  and  distilleries  are  no  exception.  While  new  
distilled
 
spirits
 
plants
 
(DSPs)
 
continue
 
to
 
open
 
across
 
the
 
country,
 
many
 
others
 
are
 
closing,
 
and
 
those
 
that
 
remain
 
are
 
struggling
 
to
 
stay
 
afloat.
 
In
 
light
 
of
 
this,
 
ACSA
 
is
 
disappointed
 
that,
 
in
 
evaluating
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
proposed
 
regulations
 
on
 
small
 
business,
 
TTB
 
does
 
not
 
propose
 
different
 
rulemakings
 
for
 
small
 
businesses
 
to
 
ease
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
their
 
operations.
  
TTB’s
 
primary
 
rulemakings
 
include
 
none
 
that
 
ease
 
the
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
producers.
 
Instead,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
proposal
 
would
 
disproportionately
 
harm
 
our
 
small
 
business
 
manufacturers
 
without
 
delivering
 
any
 
meaningful
 
public
 
benefit
 
to
 
offset
 
the
 
damage.
 
1  
 
If  TTB  does  proceed  with  an  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  rule,  it  should  exempt  small  DSPs.  ACSA  
strongly
 
urges
 
TTB
 
to
 
reexamine
 
its
 
typical
 
policy
 
of
 
promulgating
 
uniform
 
regulations
 
for
 
entities
 
of
 
all
 
sizes.
 
 
Additionally,  TTB’s  proposed  rules  get  consumer  information  and  public  health  needs  
backwards.
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
consumer
 
information
 
on
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
label
 
is
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
In
 
labeling
 
and
 
graphic
 
design,
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
info
 
gets
 
the
 
most
 
square
 
inches.
 
Yet
 
TTB’s
 
own
 
proposed
 
panels
 
in
 
this
 
rulemaking
 
take
 
up
 
over
 
50
 
times
 
the
 
surface
 
area
 
of
 
a
 
compliant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
while
 
potentially
 
only
 
adding
 
calorie
 
information
 
that
 
few
 
consumers
 
need
 
or
 
want.
 
Only
 
4%
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
report
 
that
 
consumers
 
have
 
requested
 
nutritional
 
information.
 
However,  ACSA  is  not  opposed  to  TTB’s  proposal  to  require  allergen  labeling.  Unlike  the  
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
labeling
 
rule,
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
serves
 
a
 
compelling
 
consumer
 
and
 
public
 
health
 
need
 
while
 
adding
 
minimal
 
burden
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
We  recognize  that  consumers  need  to  be  informed  about  the  risk  of  consuming  an  ingredient  
that
 
might
 
cause
 
a
 
dangerous
 
allergic
 
reaction.
 
Unlike
 
calorie
 
counts
 
in
 
non-nutritive
 
products,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
life-or-death
 
information
 
for
 
certain
 
consumers.
 
 
As  for  the  burden,  allergen  information  costs  us  nothing  to  obtain  as  we  know  what  goes  in  our  
products.
 
It
 
would
 
take
 
up
 
very
 
little
 
label
 
space,
 
limiting
 
graphic
 
design
 
and
 
printing
 
costs.
 
And
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
exemptions
 
would
 
mean
 
most
 
products
 
wouldn’t
 
need
 
to
 
include
 
any
 
new
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
labels
 
at
 
all.
 
Exempt  Small  DSPs  from  Additional  Labeling  
Requirements.
 
TTB  states  that  this  initiative  emerged  from  the  Competitiveness  Executive  Order  that  was  
intended
 
to
 
help
 
small
 
businesses
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry.
 
Yet
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM,
 
TTB
 
proposes
 
to
 
follow
 
almost
 
all
 
FDA
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
EXCEPT
 
those
 
exempting
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
ACSA  strongly  urges  TTB  to  reconsider  this  position.   
We  propose  that  TTB  consider  those  DSPs  that  removed  fewer  than  100,000  taxable  proof  
gallons
 
from
 
bond
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
calendar
 
year,
 
and
 
that
 
reasonably
 
expect
 
to
 
remove
 
fewer
 
than
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallon
 
bonds
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
calendar
 
year,
 
to
 
be
 
small
 
producers
 
for
 
the
 
purposes
 
of
 
these
 
rules.
 
This
 
threshold
 
is
 
in
 
keeping
 
with
 
the
 
intent
 
of
 
Congress’
 
having
 
set
 
that
 
threshold
 
for
 
reduced
 
excise
 
tax
 
payment
 
in
 
the
 
Craft
 
Beverage
 
Modernization
 
Act,
 
and
 
just
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
CBMTRA,
 
distillers
 
should
 
be
 
independent
 
of
 
control
 
groups
 
removing
 
more
 
than
 
that
 
proof
 
gallon
 
threshold.
 
 
According  to  TTB’s  data,  a  100,000  proof  gallon  threshold  for  new  labeling  requirements  would  
remove
 
burdens
 
from
 
small
 
businesses
 
while
 
providing
 
nutritional
 
information
 
on
 
97%
 
of
 
spirits
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
2   
Precedent  for  Exempting  Small  Businesses  From  Nutrition  Info  
Labeling
 
TTB  and  its  predecessor  ATF  have  followed  FDA’s  lead  on  nutritional  information  labeling  for  
decades,
 
and
 
this
 
NPRM
 
proposes
 
to
 
continue
 
and
 
expand
 
that
 
practice.
 
FDA
 
is
 
the
 
nation’s
 
leading
 
authority
 
on
 
nutrition
 
labeling.
 
TTB’s
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
NRPM
 
invokes
 
FDA’s
 
name
 
91
 
times.
 
TTB
 
is
 
considering
 
how
 
closely
 
its
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
requirements
 
and
 
graphic
 
design
 
should
 
mirror
 
FDA’s
 
Nutrition
 
Facts
 
labels.
 
What’s
 
more,
 
TTB
 
proposes
 
to
 
peg
 
numerous
 
nutritional
 
information
 
rules
 
to
 
FDA’s,
 
including
 
the
 
tolerance
 
for
 
calorie
 
labeling
 
accuracy
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
round
 
calories
 
to
 
the
 
nearest
 
multiple
 
of
 
ten.
 
 
As  TTB  notes  in  this  NPRM,  FDA  exempts  small  businesses  from  its  nutritional  information  
labeling
 
and
 
restaurant
 
menu
 
nutritional
 
information
 
posting
 
requirements.
 
As  TTB  well  knows,  FDA  is  responsible  for  labeling  regulations  for  certain  alcoholic  beverages,  
such
 
as
 
cider
 
with
 
under
 
7%
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume.
 
In
 
general,
 
these
 
ciders
 
must
 
follow
 
FDA’s
 
ingredient
 
and
 
nutrition
 
labeling
 
rules.
 
But
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions,
 
small
 
cider
 
producers
 
are
 
exempt.
 
See
 
the
 
below
 
slide
 
from
 
TTB’s
 
presentation
 
at
 
CiderCon
 
2023,
 
and
 
its
 
footnote
 
pointing
 
out
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions:
 
Given  that  an  entire  alcoholic  beverage  category  has  been  on  the  market  for  years  with  a  
two-tiered
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
regulation
 
that
 
exempts
 
small
 
businesses,
 
ACSA
 
encourages
 
TTB
 
to
 
consult
 
with
 
FDA
 
closely
 
on
 
consumer
 
feedback
 
on
 
this
 
issue.
 
 
Has  there  been  a  groundswell  of  consumer  comment  seeking  nutritional  and  ingredient  
information
 
labeling
 
on
 
sub-7%
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume
 
ciders
 
made
 
by
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
If  not,  is  it  worth  imposing  similar  requirements  on  thousands  of  struggling  small  distilleries  who  
collectively
 
represent
 
just
 
3%
 
of
 
the
 
spirits
 
market?
 
3  
 
TTB  Does  Have  the  Latitude  to  Exempt  Small  Businesses   
TTB  suggests  in  this  NPRM  that,  unlike  the  FDA,  it  can’t  exempt  small  businesses  from  these  
requirements.
 
It
 
makes
 
three
 
primary
 
arguments
 
to
 
support
 
this
 
position,
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
ACSA
 
vigorously
 
opposes.
 
 
TTB’s  First  Argument:  “One  of  the  primary  purposes  of  this  proposed  rule  is  to  provide  additional  information  to  
consumers.
 
This
 
purpose
 
would
 
be
 
weakened
 
by
 
a
 
permanent
 
exemption
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.”
  If  TTB  adopts  ACSA’s  proposed  100,000  proof  gallon  threshold  for  nutritional  information  
labeling,
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
spirits
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
with
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
would
 
jump
 
from
 
roughly
 
0%
 
to
 
roughly
 
97%.
 
This
 
represents
 
a
 
massive
 
increase
 
in
 
information
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
consumer
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
  The  increase  in  consumer  information  on  the  market  is  especially  drastic  considering  the  large  
proportion
 
of
 
small
 
producers’
 
volume
 
sold
 
in
 
their
 
tasting
 
rooms.
 
According
 
to
 
ACSA’s
 
annual
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Data
 
Project
 
survey,
 
the
 
smallest
 
2500
 
distilleries
 
tend
 
to
 
sell
 
nearly
 
50%
 
of
 
their
 
volume
 
within
 
their
 
own
 
tasting
 
rooms.
 
Consumers
 
buying
 
these
 
products
 
are
 
not
 
lacking
 
information
 
about
 
these
 
products-
 
we’re
 
doing
 
our
 
utmost
 
to
 
bombard
 
them
 
with
 
information
 
about
 
our
 
products
 
while
 
they’re
 
in
 
our
 
tasting
 
rooms.
  Further,  if  it’s  very  important  to  a  consumer  to  have  calorie  counts  on  their  alcohol  products,  they  
can
 
choose
 
to
 
buy
 
products
 
from
 
large
 
brands
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
include
 
that
 
information
 
in
 
their
 
labels.
 
They
 
can
 
vote
 
with
 
their
 
wallet.
 
Small
 
businesses
 
can
 
then
 
choose
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
include
 
that
 
info
 
on
 
their
 
labels
 
if
 
they
 
find
 
that
 
it’s
 
important
 
to
 
their
 
consumers.
 
  ACSA’s  members  report  that  they’ve  received  very  few  requests  for  this  information  from  
consumers.
 
In
 
a
 
member
 
survey,
 
just
 
4%
 
of
 
respondents
 
reported
 
that
 
consumers
 
had
 
ever
 
requested
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
contemplated
 
by
 
this
 
NPRM.
 
Compared
 
to
 
29%
 
of
 
survey
 
respondents
 
who
 
reported
 
having
 
received
 
consumer
 
inquiries
 
about
 
allergen
 
information,
 
that’s
 
quite
 
a
 
low
 
indication
 
of
 
consumer
 
demand
 
or
 
expectation
 
for
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
about
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
made
 
by
 
small
 
producers.
 
TTB’s  Second  Argument:  “TTB  questions  whether  a  permanent  exemption  from  mandatory  labeling  requirements  
would
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
mandate
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
labels
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity,
 
quality,
 
and
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
product.”
  The  above  argument  is  inconsistent  with  TTB’s  own  arguments  elsewhere  in  this  NPRM,  where  
TTB
 
establishes
 
its
 
authority
 
to
 
require
 
or
 
not
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
In
 
NPRM
 
4   
Section  II.  D.,  TTB  states  that  the  FAA  Act  and  the  federal  court  system  give  it  “broad  discretion”  
over
 
what
 
constitutes
 
“adequate
 
information”
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
labeling:
 
“The  FAA  Act  expressly  conveys  broad  discretion  to  the  agency  and  leaves  it  with  
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
prescribe
 
such
 
labeling
 
regulations
 
‘as
 
will
 
provide
 
the
 
consumer
 
with
 
adequate
 
information’
 
as
 
to,
 
among
 
other
 
things,
 
the
 
products’
 
‘identity
 
and
 
quality’
 
and
 
‘net
 
contents.’

U.S.C.
 
205(e).
 
In
 
1986,
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
ingredient
 
labeling,
 
the
 
D.C.
 
Circuit
 
recognized
 
that
 
the
 
obligation
 
under
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
‘to
 
ensure
 
that
 
disclosure
 
is
 
adequate
 
squarely
 
implicates
 
discretionary
 
judgment
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Secretary.
’
 
…
 
The
 
court
 
held
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
‘plain
 
meaning
 
of
 
the
 
phrase
 
‘adequate
 
information’
 
which
 
indicates
 
Congress’
 
intent
 
as
 
to
 
whether
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
either
 
requires
 
or
 
prohibits
 
ingredient
 
disclosure
 
regulations.’
 
…
 
The
 
court
 
upheld
 
ATF’s
 
conclusion
 
that
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
‘vests
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
zone
 
of
 
discretion
 
within
 
which
 
it
 
can
 
choose
 
to
 
require
 
or
 
not
 
require
 
ingredient
 
disclosure,
 
as
 
necessary
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information.’
 
Id.
 
It
 
is
 
TTB’s
 
view
 
that
 
rulemaking
 
on
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
similarly
 
falls
 
within
 
the
 
Secretary’s
 
discretion
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
such
 
information
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
‘‘adequate
 
information”
 
about
 
the
 
product.”
 
So  in  this  NPRM,  to  establish  its  authority  to  require  nutritional  information  labeling,  TTB  relies  
on
 
a
 
court
 
decision
 
in
 
favor
 
of
 
its
 
predecessor
 
agency’s
 
decision
 
not
 
to
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
That
 
decision
 
says
 
that
 
the
 
Secretary
 
has
 
broad
 
discretion
 
to
 
promulgate
 
these
 
rules
 
precisely
 
because
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
contains
 
no
 
guidance
 
whatsoever
 
on
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
Since
 
TTB
 
cites
 
this
 
decision
 
in
 
this
 
very
 
NPRM,
 
it
 
must
 
not
 
view
 
the
 
decision
 
as
 
outdated
 
or
 
incorrect.
 
And  yet  elsewhere  in  this  NPRM,  in  arguing  against  exempting  small  businesses  from  these  
new
 
rules,
 
TTB
 
says
 
it
 
questions
 
if
 
a
 
small
 
business
 
exemption
 
“would
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
mandate
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
labels
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information.”
 
But
 
if
 
TTB
 
not
 
only
 
agrees
 
with,
 
but
 
in
 
part
 
derives
 
its
 
authority
 
to
 
promulgate
 
these
 
rules
 
from,
 
the
 
court’s
 
finding
 
that
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
does
 
not
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling,
 
how
 
can
 
TTB
 
in
 
good
 
faith
 
argue
 
that
 
it
 
must
 
impose
 
new
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
on
 
small
 
businesses
 
because
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
requires
 
it
 
to?
 
TTB  can’t  have  it  both  ways.   
For  the  past  90  years,  TTB  and  its  predecessors  have  used  their  broad  discretion  in  this  area  to  
exempt
 
100%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
from
 
including
 
nutritional
 
information.
 
ACSA
 
asks
 
that
 
this
 
policy
 
be
 
continued
 
going
 
forward
 
for
 
spirits
 
produced
 
by
 
DSPs
 
whose
 
output
 
today
 
represents
 
just
 
3%
 
of
 
spirits
 
removed
 
from
 
bond.
 
5   
TTB’s  Third  Argument  
“TTB  notes  that  there  is  no  specific  statutory  authority  for  exempting  small  businesses  
from
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
under
 
the
 
Federal
 
Food,
 
Drug,
 
and
 
Cosmetic
 
Act
 
for
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
regulated
 
by
 
the
 
FDA.”
  Here,  TTB  suggests  that  it  lacks  the  authority  to  differentiate  these  regulations  based  on  size,  
because
 
while
 
FDA’s
 
authorizing
 
statute
 
requires
 
it
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
requirements,
 
TTB’s
 
does
 
not.
 
  TTB  draws  exactly  the  wrong  conclusion  from  FDA’s  small  business  exemptions.  The  existence  
of
 
a
 
statutory
 
exemption
 
at
 
another
 
agency
 
does
 
not
 
automatically
 
mean
 
that
 
TTB
 
lacks
 
authority
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
regulatory
 
exemption,
 
especially
 
considering
 
the
 
history.
  The  small  business  exemptions  in  the  1973  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act  predate  the  
1980
 
Regulatory
 
Flexibility
 
Act
 
(RFA).
 
In
 
1973,
 
agencies
 
needed
 
more
 
specific
 
authority
 
and
 
prompting
 
by
 
Congress
 
to
 
regulate
 
small
 
businesses
 
differently.
 
But
 
since
 
1980,
 
this
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
the
 
case.
 
In
 
the
 
RFA,
 
Congress
 
not
 
only
 
requires
 
that
 
agencies
 
consider
 
the
 
small
 
businesses
 
impact
 
of
 
new
 
rules.
 
It
 
also
 
states
 
that
 
agencies
 
must
 
consider
 
exemptions
 
for
 
small
 
businesses
 
when
 
contemplating
 
new
 
rules.
 
A
 
post-RFA
 
rulemaking
 
should
 
not
 
look
 
to
 
a
 
pre-RFA
 
rulemaking
 
for
 
guidance
 
on
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
Congress
 
vs.
 
the
 
Executive
 
in
 
establishing
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions.
 
Congress
 
did
 
direct
 
TTB
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
rules
 
like
 
this-
 
it
 
did
 
so
 
in
 
the
 
RFA.
  In  light  of  the  above,  ACSA  does  not  consider  TTB’s  analysis  of  small  business  exemptions  
adequate.
 
Further  RFA  Analysis  Requested   Per  the  US  SBA  Office  of  Advocacy  Guide  for  Government  Agencies  “How  to  Comply  with  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act” agencies  must  think  of  regulatory  impact  in  the  following  terms:    In  order  to  certify  a  rule  under  the  RFA,  an  agency  should  be  able  to  answer  the  following  types  
of
 
questions:
  1.  Which  small  entities  will  be  affected?  All  distilleries  will  be  affected  by  the  proposed  rule,  
without
 
exemptions.
 
Per
 
the
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Data
 
Project,
 
small
 
producers,
 
the
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
qualify
 
for
 
exemptions
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
rules,
 
which
 
we
 
think
 
would
 
be
 
reasonable,
 
number
 
about
 
2800
 
of
 
the
 
5300
 
licensed
 
distilleries
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
extremely
  
large
 
number
 
of
 
affected
 
small
 
businesses,
 
considering
 
that
 
97%
 
of
 
the
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
consumed
 
are
 
manufactured
 
by
 
large
 
conglomerates.
  2.  Have  adequate  economic  data  been  obtained?    
6   
In  Section  IX,  Cost  Analysis  of  Docket  No.  TTB-2025-0002;  Notice  No.  237  Alcohol  Facts  
Statements…,
 
TTB
 
gives
 
various
 
estimates
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
cost
 
borne
 
by
 
the
 
industry
 
through
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
labeling
 
requirements.
 
TTB
 
did
 
not
 
include
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
costs
 
incurred
 
by
 
companies
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
sales
 
value
 
of
 
such
 
products.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
under
 
the
 
RFA,
 
TTB
 
must
 
analyze
 
these
 
differences.
  For  each  individual  product,  graphic  design  costs  tend  to  be  thousands  of  dollars.  New  dies  for  
cutting
 
new
 
labels,
 
depending
 
on
 
size,
 
shape,
 
and
 
additional
 
features
 
such
 
as
 
embossing,
 
debossing,
 
or
 
foil,
 
can
 
cost
 
hundreds
 
to
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
For
 
an
 
ACSA
 
member
 
distillery
 
who
 
might
 
incur
 
these
 
costs
 
upfront
 
for
 
a
 
product
 
of
 
which
 
it
 
may
 
sell
 
just
 
hundreds
 
of
 
bottles,
 
and
 
those
 
at
 
a
 
price
 
depressed
 
to
 
compete
 
for
 
shelf
 
space
 
with
 
the
 
economies
 
of
 
scale
 
achieved
 
by
 
larger
 
industry
 
members,
 
these
 
costs
 
represent
 
a
 
significant
 
portion
 
of
 
revenue
 
from
 
that
 
product.
 
For
 
a
 
large
 
conglomerate
 
that
 
incurs
 
those
 
same
 
fees
 
but
 
amortises
 
them
 
over
 
millions
 
of
 
units
 
sold,
 
they’re
 
barely
 
a
 
consideration.
  The  alternative  to  re-printing  labels  would  be  to  add  a  new  label  for  the  sole  purpose  of  
containing
 
the
 
newly
 
required
 
information.
 
This
 
is
 
hardly
 
a
 
better
 
option,
 
as
 
it
 
requires
 
time
 
and
 
therefore
 
also
 
money.
 
For
 
small
 
distilleries
 
who
 
cannot
 
afford
 
automated
 
packaging
 
equipment,
 
adding
 
a
 
new
 
sticker
 
means
 
adding
 
a
 
new
 
person
 
to
 
the
 
bottling
 
team,
 
or
 
perhaps
 
just
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
existing
 
bottling
 
team’s
 
output
 
will
 
be
 
lowered.
 
Both
 
options
 
carry
 
significant
 
costs.
  3.  What  are  the  economic  implications/impacts  of  the  proposal  or  do  the  data  reveal  a  
significant
 
economic
 
impact
 
on
 
a
 
substantial
 
number
 
of
 
small
 
entities?
 
  Congress  also  states  that  “Agencies  should  not  give  a  narrow  reading  to  what  constitutes  a  
“significant
 
economic
 
impact”…a
 
determination
 
of
 
significant
 
economic
 
effect
 
is
 
not
 
limited
 
to
 
easily
 
quantifiable
 
costs.”
 
Congress
 
has
 
identified
 
several
 
examples
 
of
 
“significant
 
impact”:
 
a
 
rule
 
that
 
provides
 
a
 
strong
 
disincentive
 
to
 
seek
 
capital;
 
175
 
staff
 
hours
 
per
 
year
 
for
 
recordkeeping;
 
impacts
 
greater
 
than
 
the
 
$500
 
fine
 
(in
 
1980
 
dollars)
 
imposed
 
for
 
noncompliance;
 
new
 
capital
 
requirements
 
beyond
 
the
 
reach
 
of
 
the
 
entity;
 
and
 
any
 
impact
 
less
 
cost-efficient
 
than
 
another
 
reasonable
 
regulatory
 
alternative.
 
Note
 
that
 
even
 
below
 
these
 
thresholds,
 
impacts
 
may
 
be
 
significant.
 
Other,
 
more
 
specific
 
examples
 
are
 
contained
 
in
 
the
 
House
 
of
 
Representatives
 
Report
 
on
 
the
 
RFA.”
 
  Given  the  challenges  in  competition  in  the  spirits  industry  cited  in  President  Biden’s  E.O.  14036,  
Promoting
 
Competition
 
in
 
the
 
American
 
Economy
 
(July
 
9,
 
2022),
 
the
 
Executive
 
Order
 
directed
 
the
 
Secretary
 
of
 
the
 
Treasury,
 
through
 
the
 
Administrator
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
and
 
Tobacco
 
Tax
 
and
 
Trade
 
Bureau
 
(TTB),
 
to
 
consider:
 
(i)
 
initiating
 
rulemaking
 
to
 
update
 
TTB's
 
trade
 
practice
 
regulations;
 
(ii)
 
rescinding
 
or
 
revising
 
any
 
regulations
 
of
 
the
 
beer,
 
wine,
 
and
 
spirits
 
industries
 
that
 
may
 
unnecessarily
 
inhibit
 
competition;
 
and
 
(iii)
 
reducing
 
any
 
barriers
 
that
 
impede
 
market
 
access
 
for
 
smaller
 
and
 
independent
 
brewers,
 
winemakers,
 
and
 
distilleries.
 
  We  posit  that  the  TTB’s  exclusion  of  FDA’s  established  practice  of  providing  small  business  
exemptions
 
to
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
would
 
be
 
inhibiting
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
small
 
spirits
 
7   
producers  to  compete  effectively  in  an  industry  where  97%  of  the  spirits  removed  from  bond  are  
made
 
by
 
large
 
producers,
 
and
 
the
 
consolidation
 
of
 
companies
 
at
 
the
 
wholesale
 
and
 
retail
 
levels
 
would
 
make
 
it
 
difficult,
 
if
 
not
 
impossible
 
for
 
small
 
companies
 
to
 
recoup
 
any
 
of
 
these
 
costs.
 
In
 
fact,
 
these
 
expenditures
 
will
 
further
 
inhibit
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
small
 
companies
 
to
 
break
 
through
 
the
 
complete
 
market
 
domination
 
by
 
large
 
conglomerates. 
Alternate  Proposal:  Calorie  Statement  
In  the  event  that  TTB  will  not  consider  a  small  business  exemption,  ACSA  urges  TTB  to  
consider
 
less
 
burdensome
 
alternatives
 
to
 
the
 
panels
 
it
 
proposes.
 
We
 
support
 
the
 
various
 
alternatives
 
raised
 
in
 
TTB’s
 
NPRM,
 
such
 
as
 
QR
 
codes,
 
as
 
will
 
be
 
discussed
 
later
 
in
 
these
 
comments.
 
But
 
we
 
also
 
offer
 
a
 
new
 
proposal:
 
Where
 
the
 
only
 
net
 
new
 
information
 
not
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
a
 
label
 
would
 
be
 
calories,
 
just
 
require
 
that
 
the
 
calorie
 
count
 
be
 
disclosed
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
consistent
 
with
 
existing
 
TTB
 
rules
 
about
 
required
 
information.
  This  has  several  benefits.  First,  many  of  the  most  common  distilled  spirits  contain  nothing  more  
than
 
the
 
distillate
 
and
 
some
 
proofing
 
water,
 
and
 
will
 
therefore
 
have
 
very
 
little
 
added
 
information
 
in
 
either
 
the
 
panel
 
or
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
proposed
 
by
 
TTB.
 
Even
 
if
 
not
 
required
 
to
 
list
 
that
 
information
 
where
 
the
 
values
 
would
 
be
 
zero,
 
the
 
large
 
formats
 
of
 
these
 
proposed
 
displays
 
present
 
a
 
large
 
burden.
 
  In  addition,  the  existing  government  warning  could  be  expanded  to  include  a  statement  to  the  
effect
 
of
 
“this
 
product
 
contains
 
no
 
nutritive
 
value.”
 
Dispelling
 
the
 
potential
 
consumer
 
misconception
 
that
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
products
 
contain
 
meaningful
 
nutrition,
 
within
 
the
 
existing
 
display
 
of
 
government
 
health
 
disclaimers
 
about
 
alcohol
 
consumption,
 
would
 
accomplish
 
public
 
health
 
aims
 
without
 
requiring
 
as
 
extensive
 
a
 
cost
 
burden
 
of
 
our
 
small
 
distillers.
 
It
 
would
 
also
 
clarify
 
why
 
no
 
nutritional
 
information
 
beyond
 
calorie
 
count
 
is
 
contained
 
on
 
that
 
product’s
 
label.
  To  support  this  proposal,  ACSA  examined  the  impact  of  TTB’s  proposed  displays  on  label  
surface
 
area.
 
In
 
small
 
formats
 
with
 
geometric
 
limitations,
 
every
 
tiny
 
scrap
 
of
 
label
 
is
 
vital
 
real
 
estate.
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
example
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
panel
 
and
 
linear
 
display
 
provided
 
by
 
TTB
 
in
 
the
 
NPRM
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
with
 
ACSA
 
coloring
 
and
 
annotation:
 
8   
 
The  vast  majority  of  the  valuable  space  occupied  by  both  displays  is  dedicated  to  redundant  
information
 
or
 
takes
 
up
 
valuable
 
space
 
for
 
no
 
reason
 
other
 
than
 
to
 
mirror
 
FDA’s
 
nutritional
 
information
 
format.
 
The
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume
 
and
 
proof
 
are
 
redundant
 
pieces
 
of
 
information
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
labels.
 
Fl
 
oz
 
of
 
alcohol
 
is
 
another
 
way
 
of
 
stating
 
the
 
same
 
information,
 
but
 
in
 
a
 
less
 
usable
 
format
 
for
 
consumers.
 
As
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
example
 
panel,
 
there
 
will
 
in
 
many
 
if
 
not
 
most
 
cases
 
be
 
zero
 
value
 
associated
 
with
 
carbohydrate,
 
fat,
 
and
 
protein
 
on
 
most
 
common
 
distilled
 
spirits.
 
And
 
the
 
serving
 
size
 
is
 
a
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
very
 
widely
 
disseminated
 
by
 
the
 
CDC.
  The  only  entirely  new  piece  of  information,  the  calorie  count,  takes  up  less  than  3%  of  the  panel  
display’s
 
surface
 
area,
 
and
 
slightly
 
more
 
than
 
4%
 
of
 
the
 
linear
 
display’s
 
area.
 
We
 
believe
 
there
 
are
 
better
 
ways
 
to
 
deliver
 
this
 
information
 
that
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
lower
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens.
 
These
 
bulky
 
displays
 
will
 
be
 
difficult
 
to
 
fit
 
into
 
carefully
 
balanced
 
works
 
of
 
graphic
 
design
 
on
 
small
 
packages,
 
all
 
to
 
add
 
relatively
 
little
 
new
 
information.
  ACSA’s  proposal  to  simply  require  a  calorie  statement  would  take  up  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  space  
that
 
these
 
TTB
 
proposals
 
would,
 
and
 
it
 
would
 
add
 
almost
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
information.

Any  New  Regulation  Must  Reflect  Digital  Reality  
ACSA  members  are  concerned  by  the  difficult-to-understand  enforcement  of  existing  regulations  
about
 
the
 
depiction
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
labels
 
online.
 
They’re
 
concerned
 
that
 
this
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
regulations
 
might
 
increase
 
online
 
compliance
 
risk
 
without
 
meaningful
 
public
 
health
 
benefit.
 
A
 
case
 
study
 
from
 
an
 
ACSA
 
member
 
distillery
 
will
 
illustrate
 
the
 
cause
 
for
 
concern:
   An  ACSA  member  was  contacted  by  TTB’s  Market  Compliance  Office.  They  told  him  
that
 
a
 
product
 
photo
 
on
 
his
 
website
 
was
 
too
 
low
 
resolution
 
for
 
the
 
required
 
statement
 
of
 
disclosure
 
of
 
caramel
 
coloring
 
to
 
be
 
legible,
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
initiating
 
a
 
broader
 
audit
 
of
 
his
 
DSP’s
 
practices
 
as
 
a
 
result.
  Looking  through  the  DSP’s  digital  presence,  the  TTB  representatives  told  the  DSP  
operator
 
that
 
if
 
he
 
posts
 
a
 
photo
 
of
 
a
 
product
 
that
 
has
 
the
 
caramel
 
/
 
food
 
color
 
disclosure
 
on
 
the
 
rear
 
label,
 
which
 
is
 
allowed
 
by
 
COLAs,
 
he
 
must
 
also
 
post
 
a
 
photo
 
of
 
the
 
rear
 
label
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
disclosure.
  The  DSP  operator  asked  if  he  also  had  to  ensure  the  Government  Warning  and  alcohol  
content
 
statement
 
were
 
legible
 
as
 
well.
 
They
 
told
 
him
 
that
 
no,
 
it’s
 
just
 
about
 
the
 
coloring
 
disclosures.
  The  TTB  representatives  further  informed  him  that  if  any  consumer  were  to  post  a  photo  
on
 
social
 
media
 
of
 
his
 
product
 
without
 
the
 
coloring
 
statement
 
being
 
legible,
 
and
 
the
 
DSP’s
 
social
 
media
 
account
 
liked
 
the
 
photo,
 
that
 
would
 
constitute
 
a
 
prohibited
 
market
 
practice.
  The  above  story  indicates  an  inexplicable  prioritization  of  the  legibility  of  a  label  statement  that,  
while
 
required,
 
is
 
orders
 
of
 
magnitude
 
less
 
important
 
to
 
a
 
consumer
 
than,
 
for
 
example,
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
Yet
 
TTB
 
viewed
 
this
 
as
 
an
 
important
 
enough
 
issue
 
to
 
initiate
 
a
 
broader
 
investigation.
 
In
 
light
 
of
 
stories
 
like
 
this,
 
when
 
ACSA
 
members
 
are
 
confronted
 
with
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
a
 
broad
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
labeling
 
requirements,
 
they
 
understandably
 
wonder
 
if
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
enforced
 
in
 
a
 
sensible
 
manner.
 
  ACSA  therefore  requests  that  TTB  take  a  hard  look  at  how  any  new  proposed  labeling  
regulation
 
would
 
relate
 
to
 
its
 
rules
 
about
 
online
 
conduct.
 
It
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
practical
 
or
 
in
 
many
 
cases
 
even
 
possible
 
to
 
show
 
100%
 
of
 
label
 
information
 
on
 
a
 
three-dimensional
 
object
 
in
 
many
 
forms
 
of
 
online
 
communication
 
or
 
marketing.
 
The
 
rules
 
need
 
to
 
reflect
 
that.
 
And
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
prioritize
 
what
 
information
 
truly
 
matters
 
most.
  
10   
ANSWERS  TO  SPECIFIC  TTB  QUESTIONS  
TTB’s  NPRM  asks  for  input  on  a  number  of  specific  questions.  Below  we  provide  answers  to  
those
 
questions
 
not
 
answered
 
elsewhere
 
in
 
these
 
comments.
 
 
Alcohol  Facts  
1.  Title  of  the  Alcohol  Beverage  Information  Statement  
1.1.  Which  title,  ‘‘Serving  Facts’’  or  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts,’’  would  be  more  informative  
to
 
consumers?
 
Does
 
the
 
title
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
better
 
describe
 
the
 
information
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
statement,
 
which
 
includes
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information?
 
 
“Serving  Facts”  more  clearly  communicates  that  this  applies  to  the  specific  
product.
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
sounds
 
like
 
it
 
applies
 
generally
 
to
 
alcohol,
 
not
 
necessarily
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
product
 
in
 
question,
 
as
 
though
 
the
 
same
 
information
 
might
 
be
 
on
 
every
 
label
 
for
 
every
 
product.
 
The
 
same
 
way
 
we
 
all
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
“Government
 
Warning”
 
label.
 
 
The  proposed  panel  already  says  “serving”  and  “Serving  facts”  in  multiple  
locations.
 
1.2.  Would  the  use  of  the  title  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts’’  affect  compliance  costs  or  
regulatory
 
burdens
 
by
 
requiring
 
a
 
title
 
change
 
for
 
products
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
labeled
 
with
 
a
 
‘‘Serving
 
Facts’’
 
statement?
 
 
Yes.  Any  change  requires  paying  graphic  design  fees  and  additional  printing  
fees.
 
1.3.  Are  consumers  accustomed  to  finding  nutrient  content  information  in  a  
Serving
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
Would
 
changing
 
the
 
title
 
to
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
cause
 
confusion?
 
Yes,  “Alcohol  Facts”  sounds  like  it’s  telling  consumers  facts  about  alcohol  in  
general.
 
This
 
may
 
be
 
confusing.
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
sounds
 
more
 
familiar
 
based
 
on
 
existing
 
FDA
 
Nutritional
 
Facts,
 
and
 
makes
 
more
 
clear
 
that
 
it
 
applies
 
to
 
a
 
single
 
serving
 
of
 
the
 
labeled
 
product.
 
In  a  significant  number  of  alcoholic  beverages,  the  majority  of  the  calories,  fats,  
and
 
sugars
 
can
 
come
 
from
 
ingredients
 
in
 
the
 
beverages
 
which
 
have
 
nothing
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
ethanol.
 
Take
 
for
 
example
 
a
 
canned
 
Pina
 
Colada,
 
which
 
would
 
likely
 
contain
 
considerable
 
amounts
 
of
 
added
 
sugar
 
and
 
fat,
 
whose
 
additional
 
calories
 
would
 
not
 
be
 
from
 
alcohol.
 
11   
1.4.  Alternatively,  does  the  title  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts’’  make  it  easier  for  consumers  to  
readily
 
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items?
 
We  do  not  consider  this  a  serious  concern.  Other  labeling  regulations  make  it  
clear
 
what
 
product
 
is
 
what.
 
Whiskey
 
says
 
“whiskey”
 
on
 
it,
 
ketchup
 
says
 
“ketchup”
 
on
 
it.
 
Consumers
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
product
 
name,
 
not
 
the
 
fine
 
print
 
to
 
identify
 
products.
 
 
2.  Mandatory  Calorie  and  Nutrient  Information  
2.1.  TTB  specifically  seeks  comments  on  whether  fat  and  protein,  which  are  not  
typically
 
found
 
in
 
certain
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
only
 
if
 
present
 
at
 
specific
 
levels.
 
If
 
so,
 
what
 
levels
 
should
 
trigger
 
these
 
requirements?
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
any
 
other
 
nutrients,
 
such
 
as
 
sodium,
 
caffeine,
 
or
 
sugar,
 
should
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
if
 
present
 
at
 
a
 
specific
 
level,
 
even
 
if
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
otherwise
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed.
 
Yes,  only  require  fat  and  protein  to  be  disclosed  if  above  a  certain  threshold.  
Requiring
 
space
 
for
 
those
 
to
 
be
 
set
 
aside
 
on
 
most
 
labels,
 
where
 
the
 
amount
 
will
 
be
 
zero,
 
will
 
be
 
unnecessarily
 
disruptive
 
and
 
expensive.
 
Some  Standards  of  Identity  allow  any  number  of  added  ingredients,  and  many  
products
 
conform
 
to
 
Standards
 
of
 
Identity
 
which
 
do
 
not
 
allow
 
any
 
additives.
 
TTB
 
should
 
consider
 
allowing
 
minimal
 
information
 
for
 
such
 
Standards
 
of
 
Identity,
 
reserving
 
the
 
full
 
panel
 
for
 
those
 
products
 
with
 
added
 
flavors,
 
fats
 
and
 
sugars.
 
For  example,  a  bourbon  is  not  permitted  to  contain  any  Coloring,  Flavoring,  or  
Blending
 
materials.
 
If
 
it
 
meets
 
the
 
standard
 
of
 
identity,
 
it
 
should
 
contain
 
no
 
added
 
sugar,
 
fat,
 
or
 
protein,
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
list
 
their
 
concentrations.
 
2.2.  Should  TTB’s  proposed  nutrient  content  labeling  statement  be  more  
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
Nutrition
 
Facts
 
Label
 
found
 
on
 
foods
 
that
 
are
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction?
 
Alternatively,
 
do
 
the
 
differences
 
between
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
and
 
other
 
foods
 
make
 
it
 
unnecessary,
 
or
 
even
 
misleading,
 
to
 
adopt
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
required
 
on
 
food
 
labels
 
that
 
are
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction?
 
For
 
example,
 
would
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
daily
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
listed
 
nutrients
 
provided
 
by
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
be
 
useful
 
information
 
for
 
consumers?
 
Alternatively,
 
could
 
such
 
statements
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
implying
 
that
 
they
 
may
 
rely
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
consumption
 
to
 
satisfy
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
daily
 
nutrient
 
requirements?
 
Displaying  nutritional  information  in  the  same  exact  manner  as  food  labels  might  
mislead
 
consumers.
 
Without
 
a
 
thorough
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
 
an
 
ingredient
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
processed
 
in
 
the
 
fermentation
 
and
 
distillation
 
process,
 
they
 
might
 
think
 
its
 
inclusion
 
on
 
an
 
ingredient
 
list,
 
alongside
 
a
 
nutrition
 
facts
 
panel,
 
means
 
there’s
 
12   
nutritive  value  in  the  product.  Alcoholic  beverages  should  not  be  regarded  as  a  
source
 
of
 
nutrition,
 
and
 
should
 
therefore
 
be
 
labeled
 
differently
 
to
 
make
 
that
 
clear.
 
2.3.  For  greater  consistency  with  the  FDA  Nutrition  Facts  Label,  should  Alcohol  
Facts
 
statements
 
be
 
allowed
 
or
 
required
 
to
 
include
 
other
 
elements
 
(such
 
as
 
sodium
 
and
 
cholesterol)
 
or
 
a
 
further
 
breakdown
 
of
 
fat
 
(to
 
include
 
saturated
 
fat
 
and
 
trans-fat)?
 
TTB’s  required  statements,  if  this  rule  is  adopted,  should  only  require  listing  of  
elements
 
that
 
are
 
commonly
 
found
 
in
 
significant
 
amounts
 
in
 
spirits
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
class
 
and
 
type.
 
Additions
 
of
 
other
 
elements
 
should
 
be
 
allowed
 
but
 
not
 
required.
 
2.4.  Would  the  inclusion  of  elements  not  ordinarily  expected  to  be  found  in  
alcohol
 
beverages
 
(such
 
as
 
trans-fat
 
and
 
dietary
 
fiber)
 
be
 
useful
 
or
 
potentially
 
misleading?
 
This  would  not  be  useful.  It  would  be  akin  to  requiring  a  statement  of  alcohol  
content
 
on
 
cartons
 
of
 
milk.
 
This
 
would
 
be
 
misleading.
 
Consumers
 
would
 
see
 
the
 
contents
 
labeled
 
as
 
zero,
 
but
 
the
 
implication
 
of
 
its
 
inclusion
 
would
 
be
 
that
 
many
 
similar
 
products
 
must
 
have
 
a
 
significant
 
enough
 
concentration
 
of
 
the
 
element
 
in
 
question
 
that
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
its
 
content
 
be
 
included,
 
when
 
in
 
fact
 
the
 
opposite
 
is
 
true.
 
This
 
would
 
create
 
the
 
question
 
in
 
consumers’
 
minds-
 
have
 
I
 
been
 
unknowingly
 
consuming
 
products
 
containing
 
this
 
element,
 
but
 
I
 
just
 
never
 
noticed?
 
2.5.  Should  TTB  allow  numerical  statements  of  the  vitamin  and  mineral  content  
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
assuming
 
the
 
product
 
contains
 
vitamins
 
or
 
minerals,
 
or
 
could
 
such
 
a
 
statement
 
create
 
an
 
erroneous
 
impression
 
that
 
consumption
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
has
 
nutritional
 
value
 
or
 
other
 
health
 
related
 
benefits?
 
 
No.
 
This
 
would
 
muddy
 
the
 
waters
 
regarding
 
the
 
prohibition
 
on
 
making
 
health
 
claims
 
on
 
spirits
 
labels.
 
We
 
maintain
 
our
 
stance
 
that
 
alcohol
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
considered
 
to
 
have
 
nutritive
 
value.
 
2.6.  How  many  industry  members  already  provide  nutrient  content  information  
on
 
labels,
 
in
 
advertisements
 
(such
 
as
 
websites),
 
or
 
upon
 
request
 
(for
 
example,
 
to
 
consumers
 
or
 
restaurants)?
 
 
 
In
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
our
 
members,
 
3%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
they
 
include
 
this
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
labels.
 
 
2.7.  Do  consumers  want  to  see  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  on  alcohol  beverage  
products?
 
How
 
might
 
consumers
 
benefit
 
from
 
such
 
a
 
label?
 
Do
 
consumers
 
have
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
alcohol
 
13   
beverages  if  alcohol  beverage  containers  do  not  include  Alcohol  Facts  
labeling?
 
How
 
do
 
those
 
benefits
 
compare
 
to
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
associated
 
with
 
such
 
revisions?
 
 
In
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
our
 
members,
 
just
 
4%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
consumers
 
had
 
ever
 
requested
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
from
 
their
 
companies.
 
Compare
 
that
 
to
 
29%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
consumers
 
had
 
requested
 
allergen
 
info.
 
 
 
Very,
 
very
 
few
 
of
 
our
 
consumers
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
this
 
information
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
broad
 
understanding
 
that
 
alcohol
 
does
 
not
 
contain
 
nutritive
 
value.
 
2.8.  How,  if  at  all,  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  
competition
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
market?
 
 
 
Every
 
additional
 
regulatory
 
requirement
 
disproportionately
 
burdens
 
small
 
businesses.
 
This
 
common-sense
 
principle
 
is
 
behind
 
countless
 
federal
 
laws
 
and
 
regulations,
 
including
 
of
 
course
 
the
 
Regulatory
 
Flexibility
 
Act.
 
For
 
us,
 
a
 
dollar
 
spent
 
on
 
graphic
 
design
 
fees
 
or
 
label
 
printing
 
means
 
a
 
dollar
 
not
 
spent
 
on
 
wages,
 
on
 
marketing,
 
or
 
on
 
our
 
many
 
other
 
under-funded
 
needs
 
costs.
 
 
 
For
 
the
 
large
 
producers
 
that
 
dominate
 
the
 
market,
 
a
 
dollar
 
spent
 
on
 
meeting
 
these
 
requirements
 
means
 
a
 
dollar
 
less
 
of
 
their
 
multi-million
 
or
 
-billion
 
dollar
 
profits.
 
As
 
small
 
producers
 
are
 
already
 
burdened
 
disproportionally
 
to
 
their
 
market
 
or
 
tax
 
liability
 
impact
 
in
 
reporting
 
requirements,
 
this
 
will
 
add
 
an
 
extra
 
level
 
of
 
testing
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
labels
 
are
 
accurate,
 
or
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
not,
 
a
 
more
 
serious
 
vulnerability
 
to
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
any
 
TTB
 
penalties
 
or
 
costs
 
of
 
initiating
 
corrections,
 
if
 
the
 
labels
 
are
 
found
 
during
 
examination
 
to
 
be
 
insufficiently
 
accurate.
 
2.9.  How  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  small  
businesses
 
and,
 
in
 
particular,
 
new
 
businesses
 
entering
 
into
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
marketplace?
 
 
See  above.  
2.10.  How,  if  at  all,  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  
international
 
trade
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages?
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
information
 
that
 
should,
 
or
 
should
 
not,
 
be
 
included
 
to
 
align
 
the
 
proposed
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
with
 
those
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
Alignment  to  international  standards  are  generally  to  be  desired.  Costs  of  
changes
 
to
 
labels
 
for
 
export
 
purposes
 
are
 
again,
 
disproportionately
 
impactful
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.

3.  Calculating  Panel  Elements  and  Tolerance  Levels  
3.1.  TTB  seeks  comments  on  whether  the  proposed  tolerances  are  broad  
enough
 
to
 
facilitate
 
reliance
 
on
 
databases
 
for
 
standard
 
products,
 
among
 
other
 
methods
 
for
 
calculating
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
content,
 
but
 
still
 
specific
 
enough
 
to
 
provide
 
accurate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
Specifically,
 
TTB
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
it
 
should
 
instead
 
propose
 
the
 
same
 
tolerances
 
set
 
forth
 
in
 
TTB
 
Procedure
 
2020–1
 
or
 
whether
 
another
 
approach
 
should
 
be
 
considered.
 
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
real
 
concern.
 
For
 
small
 
producers
 
especially,
 
the
 
least
 
expensive
 
methods
 
are
 
those
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
used,
 
and
 
without
 
clear
 
guidance
 
from
 
TTB
 
on
 
acceptable
 
calculators,
 
many
 
will
 
use
 
what
 
they
 
find
 
online.
 
TTB
 
should
 
consider
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
when
 
calculating
 
tolerance
 
-
 
small
 
producers
 
making
 
hundreds
 
of
 
units
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
judged
 
like
 
large
 
conglomerates
 
producing
 
millions
 
of
 
units.
 
4.  Mandatory  Listing  of  Alcohol  by  Volume  on  All  Alcohol  Beverage  
Products
 
 
4.1.  What  are  the  potential  benefits  to  consumers  and  industry  members  from  a  
requirement
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements,
 
expressed
 
as
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume,
 
on
 
the
 
labels
 
of
 
all
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
products?
 
 
ACSA  advocates  for  parity  in  alcohol  regulations  between  product  categories,  
and
 
this
 
is
 
no
 
different.
 
Ethanol
 
is
 
ethanol.
 
Beer
 
and
 
wine
 
should
 
have
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
guidelines
 
that
 
spirits
 
do.
 
 
There’s
 
no
 
compelling
 
reason
 
that
 
a
 
spirit-based
 
RTD
 
with
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
12%
 
should
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
carry
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
while
 
a
 
table
 
wine
 
containing
 
12%
 
alcohol
 
does
 
not.
 
Alcohol
 
is
 
a
 
controlled
 
substance
 
and
 
consumers
 
deserve
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
it
 
they
 
are
 
consuming.
 
 
This  disparity  in  labeling  regulations  is  part  of  the  increasingly  outdated  
penalization
 
of
 
spirits
 
relative
 
to
 
beer
 
and
 
wine.
 
It
 
is
 
also
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
flawed
 
assumption
 
that
 
products
 
from
 
these
 
different
 
product
 
categories
 
are
 
always
 
consumed
 
in
 
a
 
particular
 
manner-
 
e.g.,
 
that
 
wine
 
is
 
consumed
 
thoughtfully
 
with
 
dinner
 
while
 
spirits
 
are
 
downed
 
by
 
the
 
shot
 
at
 
a
 
saloon.
 
Wines
 
may
 
be
 
consumed
 
irresponsibly,
 
while
 
spirits
 
may
 
be
 
slowly
 
sipped
 
and
 
savored.
 
Parity
 
in
 
labeling
 
alcohol
 
content
 
regulations
 
would
 
remove
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
the
 
information
 
consumers
 
need
 
to
 
make
 
responsible
 
decisions
 
about
 
their
 
alcohol
 
consumption.
 
4.2.  Will  the  proposed  requirement  for  alcohol  content  labeling  for  all  beer  and  
malt
 
beverages
 
result
 
in
 
additional
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
for
 
brewers
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
small
 
businesses?
 
Will
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
alcohol
 
15   
content  tolerances  mitigate  or  reduce  those  costs  and  burdens?   
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
brewers
 
on
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
of
 
this
 
issue.
 
4.3.  Will  the  proposed  increase  in  alcohol  content  tolerances  for  malt  beverages  
mislead
 
consumers?
 
If
 
so,
 
does
 
the
 
same
 
argument
 
apply
 
to
 
wines,
 
which
 
currently
 
have
 
a
 
1.5
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
wines
 
up
 
to
 
14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume,
 
and
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
wines
 
with
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
over
 
14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume?
 
 
TTB
 
suggests
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM
 
that
 
its
 
proposal
 
to
 
increase
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
is
 
in
 
large
 
part
 
out
 
of
 
consideration
 
for
 
the
 
concern
 
of
 
small
 
brewers.
  
The
 
NPRM
 
notes
 
that
 
the
 
Brewers’
 
Association
 
and
 
independent
 
brewers
 
argued
 
in
 
past
 
rulemaking
 
processes
 
that
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
accurate
 
compliance
 
is
 
burdensome
 
to
 
small
 
producers
 
and
 
would
 
deter
 
new
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
starting.
 
 
 
ACSA
 
completely
 
agrees
 
with
 
the
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
Brewers
 
Association
 
and
 
the
 
independent
 
brewers
 
referred
 
to
 
in
 
TTB’s
 
NPRM.
 
It
 
is
 
too
 
expensive
 
and
 
too
 
difficult
 
for
 
small
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
producers
 
to
 
meet
 
a
 
0.3%
 
percentage
 
point
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
tolerance.
 
 
 
NEW
 
ACSA
 
PROPOSAL:
 
INCREASE
 
ALCOHOL
 
CONTENT
 
TOLERANCES
 
FOR
 
SMALL
 
BREWERIES
 
AND
 
DISTILLERIES
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
proceeding
 
with
 
this
 
proposal
 
despite
 
opposition
 
from
 
the
 
Beer
 
Institute,
 
which
 
tends
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
larger
 
beer
 
brands.
 
We
 
applaud
 
TTB’s
 
consideration
 
for
 
the
 
challenges
 
particular
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
But
 
applying
 
this
 
tolerance
 
to
 
large
 
and
 
small
 
breweries
 
alike
 
is
 
unwise.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
labeling
 
tolerance
 
represents
 
a
 
massive
 
variation
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content
 
for
 
relatively
 
low-alcohol
 
malt
 
beverages
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
varieties.
 
This
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
dangerous
 
discrepancy
 
between
 
the
 
true
 
and
 
expected
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages.
 
 
Many
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
Malt
 
Beverages
 
are
 
Hard
 
Seltzers,
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
of
 
which
 
tend
 
to
 
contain
 
about
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
on
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
constitutes
 
a
 
20%
 
tolerance
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
The
 
below
 
chart
 
demonstrates
 
that
 
with
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance,
 
a
 
12-oz
 
can
 
of
 
malt
 
beverage
 
with
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
might
 
contain
 
anywhere
 
from
 
11.2
 
to
 
16.8
 
mL
 
of
 
Ethyl
 
Alcohol,
 
or
 
0.8
 
to
 
1.2
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
Put
 
another
 
way,
 
a
 
can
 
containing
 
.8
 
standard
 
drinks
 
could
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
as
 
a
 
can
 
containing
 
1.2
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
16   
 
This  effect  is  more  dangerously  exaggerated  when  extrapolated  to  a  binge  
drinking
 
session.
 
Five
 
12-oz
 
cans
 
of
 
malt
 
beverage
 
with
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
might
 
contain
 
anywhere
 
from
 
four
 
to
 
six
 
standard
 
drinks
 
with
 
a
 
1%
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance.
 
Imagine
 
a
 
consumer
 
who
 
on
 
one
 
occasion
 
drank
 
five
 
cans
 
of
 
the
 
malt
 
beverage
 
in
 
question,
 
and
 
that
 
batch
 
had
 
an
 
actual
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
4%
 
by
 
volume.
 
They
 
felt
 
confident
 
they
 
were
 
under
 
the
 
legal
 
limit,
 
then
 
drove
 
home.
 
A
 
couple
 
weeks
 
later,
 
they
 
drink
 
five
 
cans
 
from
 
a
 
different
 
batch.
 
This
 
one
 
has
 
an
 
actual
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
6%.
 
They
 
consumed
 
fifty
 
percent
 
more
 
alcohol
 
than
 
last
 
time,
 
but
 
the
 
package
 
says
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
is
 
the
 
same.
 
Might
 
they
 
assume
 
that
 
since
 
they
 
were
 
OK
 
to
 
drive
 
last
 
time,
 
they’re
 
probably
 
ok
 
this
 
time?
 
Applying  a  1%  tolerance  to  malt  beverages  produced  by  small  brewers  and  a  .3%  
tolerance
 
to
 
large
 
brewers
 
would
 
address
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
concerns
 
TTB
 
is
 
juggling
 
here.
 
It
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages
 
from
 
small
 
breweries
 
more
 
information
 
than
 
labels
 
currently
 
require,
 
while
 
acknowledging
 
the
 
reality
 
that
 
small
 
brewers
 
have
 
a
 
difficult
 
time
 
maintaining
 
precision
 
in
 
this
 
arena.
 
And
 
the
 
.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
applied
 
to
 
large
 
brewers’
 
malt
 
beverages
 
would
 
apply
 
a
 
rigorous
 
standard
 
to
 
the
 
vast,
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
malt
 
beverage
 
market,
 
addressing
 
the
 
consumer
 
information
 
concerns
 
in
 
most
 
situations.
 
 
For  the  most  popular  distilled  spirits,  the  math  works  out  very  differently.  For  a  
standard
 
serving
 
of
 
1.5
 
Oz.
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits,
 
the
 
current
 
0.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
results
 
in
 
a
 
permissible
 
range
 
of
 
17.9
 
to
 
18.1
 
mL
 
of
 
ethyl
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
1.007
 
to
 
1.022
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
1.5-Oz.
 
serving
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits
 
containing
 
17.6
 
to
 
18.5
 
mL
 
of
 
ethyl
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
17  
 
0.99  to  1.04  standard  drinks.  This  represents  a  variation  in  ethyl  alcohol  content  
of
 
just
 
2.5%
 
relative
 
to
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
This
 
is
 
less
 
variation
 
than
 
exists
 
under
 
even
 
the
 
current
 
.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
on
 
a
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
beverage.
 
 
Applying  the  lens  of  a  five-serving  binge  drinking  session  to  this  tolerance  
question
 
in
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
we
 
again
 
find
 
that
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
minimal
 
variation
 
in
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed.
 
At
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
40%,
 
the
 
proposed
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed
 
of
 
4.95
 
to
 
5.2.
 
In
 
both
 
cases,
 
essentially
 
five
 
drinks.
 
Compare
 
this
 
to
 
the
 
50%
 
swing
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
4
 
drinks
 
to
 
6
 
drinks
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
in
 
a
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
Malt
 
Beverage.
 
We  need  to  point  out  that  of  course  distilled  spirits  can  have  low  alcohol  contents  
as
 
well,
 
and
 
can
 
therefore
 
also
 
experience
 
the
 
large
 
relative
 
swings
 
from
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance.
 
 
But  we  argue  that  regulations  should  be  built  around  market  realities.  Most  spirits  
on
 
the
 
market
 
are
 
of
 
higher
 
proof
 
than
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
and
 
therefore
 
the
 
same
 
label
 
tolerance
 
results
 
in
 
a
 
tighter
 
range
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
There’s
 
a
 
reason
 
CDC
 
expresses
 
its
 
standard
 
drink
 
guidance
 
for
 
spirits
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits:
 
it’s
 
something
 
of
 
an
 
industry
 
standard
 
and
 
a
 
consumer
 
expectation.
 
In
 
the
 
RTD
 
beverage
 
space,
 
where
 
malt
 
beverages
 
and
 
spirits-based
 
RTDs
 
tend
 
to
 
most
 
often
 
have
 
similar
 
alcohol
 
contents,
 
malt
 
beverages
 
account
 
for
 
a
 
much
 
larger
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
market.
 
They
 
tend
 
to
 
enjoy
 
lower
 
excise
 
tax
 
rates
 
and
 
less
 
18  
 
restrictive  distribution  and  retailing  regimes  than  spirit-based  RTDs,  so  large  
companies
 
often
 
favor
 
them,
 
and
 
they’re
 
more
 
widely
 
available
 
to
 
consumers.
 
The  discrepancy  in  market  position  between  malt  beverage-  and  spirit-based  
RTDs
 
described
 
above
 
is
 
especially
 
true
 
among
 
smaller
 
craft
 
distilleries
 
to
 
whom
 
we
 
propose
 
that
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
apply.
 
The
 
processing
 
and
 
canning
 
equipment
 
required
 
to
 
produce
 
these
 
is
 
too
 
expensive
 
for
 
most
 
small
 
distilleries
 
to
 
purchase.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
only
 
a
 
relatively
 
small
 
portion
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
produced
 
by
 
small
 
distillers
 
under
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
low
 
enough
 
alcohol
 
content
 
to
 
experience
 
a
 
significant
 
variation
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
We  also  acknowledge  that  labeled  vs.  actual  alcohol  content  carries  different  tax  
implications
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
than
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
and
 
wines.
 
Of
 
course
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
are
 
taxed
 
on
 
a
 
proof
 
gallon
 
basis,
 
where
 
other
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
taxed
 
by
 
volume,
 
or
 
by
 
volume
 
within
 
alcohol
 
content
 
ranges.
 
There
 
is
 
therefore
 
a
 
potential
 
concern
 
that
 
if
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
have
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance,
 
tax
 
revenue
 
could
 
be
 
impacted.
 
If
 
a
 
spirit
 
labeled
 
at
 
40%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
and
 
is
 
taxed
 
accordingly,
 
but
 
in
 
fact
 
contains
 
40.6%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol,
 
that
 
spirit
 
was
 
undertaxed.
 
But  TTB’s  data  shows  that  the  potential  revenue  impact  of  a  1  percentage  point  
alcohol
 
content
 
tolerance
 
for
 
distillers
 
removing
 
less
 
than
 
100,000
 
Proof
 
Gallons
 
from
 
bond
 
per
 
year
 
would
 
be
 
minimal.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
most
 
recently
 
released
 
version
 
of
 
TTB’s
 
“Statistical
 
Report
 
-
 
Distilled
 
Spirits
 
Permit
 
Counts
 
and
 
Average
 
Removals
 
by
 
Year,”
 
distillers
 
of
 
this
 
size
 
accounted
 
for
 
about
 
94.5%
 
of
 
DSPs
 
and
 
about
 
3.5%
 
of
 
taxable
 
removals
 
in
 
2022.
 
Assuming
 
that
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
removals
 
were
 
taxed
 
at
 
the
 
$2.70
 
/
 
Proof
 
Gallon
 
rate,
 
the
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
from
 
these
 
small
 
distillers
 
amounted
 
to
 
about
 
$35
 
million,
 
or
 
less
 
than
 
1%
 
of
 
total
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
that
 
year.
 
Against  that  $35  million  total  the  current  allowable  .3  percentage  point  tolerance  
could
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
maximum
 
variation
 
in
 
excise
 
tax
 
income
 
of
 
$105,177.
 
This
 
would
 
only
 
occur
 
if
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
spirits
 
in
 
this
 
category
 
were
 
the
 
full
 
.3
 
percentage
 
points
 
off
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
direction.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
unlikely
 
outcome
 
as
 
some
 
spirits
 
will
 
be
 
overproof,
 
some
 
under.
 
This
 
improbable
 
$105,177
 
variation
 
in
 
tax
 
revenue
 
would
 
account
 
for
 
just
 
0.0023%
 
of
 
all
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
in
 
2022.
 
Against  that  $35  million  base,  a  1  percentage  point  tolerance  for  producers  with  
under
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallons
 
of
 
removal
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
maximum
 
excise
 
tax
 
revenue
 
variation
 
of
 
$350,590
 
if
 
every
 
single
 
bottle
 
were
 
fully
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
off
 
the
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
direction.
 
This
 
would
 
account
 
for
 
just
 
0.0075%
 
of
 
all
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
in
 
2022.
 
 
Put  differently,  changing  the  tolerance  from  .3  percentage  points  to  1  percentage  
point
 
for
 
distilleries
 
removing
 
less
 
than
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallons
 
from
 
bond,
 
could
 
19   
under  a  highly  improbable  set  of  circumstances  result  in  an  increase  of  potential  
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
revenue
 
variation
 
from
 
0.0023%
 
to
 
0.0075%
 
of
 
total
 
revenue.
 
ACSA
 
argues
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
significant
 
revenue
 
impact.
 
Additionally,  this  would  align  closer  with  the  reality  of  the  marketplace.  In  2018’s  
Notice
 
No.
 
176,
 
which
 
proposed
 
the
 
liberalization
 
of
 
the
 
prior
 
tolerance,
 
TTB
 
stated
 
that
 
the
 
discrepancy
 
between
 
real
 
world
 
results
 
and
 
the
 
regulation
 
drove
 
the
 
rule
 
change.
 
This
 
makes
 
sense-
 
if
 
nearly
 
¾
 
of
 
spirits
 
sampled
 
can’t
 
meet
 
a
 
rule,
 
the
 
rule
 
might
 
be
 
unrealistic.
 
And
 
that
 
was
 
indeed
 
the
 
case
 
at
 
the
 
time-
 
the
 
most
 
recently
 
published
 
TTB
 
Alcohol
 
Beverage
 
Sampling
 
Program
 
results
 
are
 
from
 
2016,
 
when
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
tolerance
 
for
 
being
 
overproof
 
and
 
a
 
.15%
 
under
 
proof
 
tolerance.
 
Under
 
those
 
tighter
 
tolerances,
 
TTB
 
found
 
73.5%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
sampled
 
in
 
2016
 
to
 
have
 
alcohol
 
content
 
out
 
of
 
tolerance.
 
In
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
more
 
recent
 
data,
 
applying
 
some
 
assumptions
 
to
 
that
 
2016
 
data
 
suggests
 
that
 
approximately
 
33%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
were
 
likely
 
out
 
of
 
tolerance
 
with
 
the
 
current
 
.3%
 
tolerance.
 
Given
 
the
 
difficulty
 
and
 
expense
 
required
 
for
 
smaller
 
producers
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
wine,
 
and
 
spirits
 
to
 
hit
 
tight
 
tolerances,
 
and
 
the
 
growing
 
number
 
of
 
small
 
producers
 
since
 
2016,
 
it
 
seems
 
likely
 
that
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
spirits
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
today
 
are
 
out
 
of
 
compliance.
 
4.4.  Do  the  proposed  labeling  requirements  for  non-alcoholic  malt  beverages  
adequately
 
advise
 
the
 
consumer
 
that
 
the
 
products
 
contain
 
less
 
than
 
0.5
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume?
 
Should
 
non-alcoholic
 
malt
 
beverages
 
be
 
exempted
 
from
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
requirements?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
brewers
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
4.5.  What,  if  any,  additional  costs  or  burdens  would  requiring  numerical  alcohol  
content
 
statements
 
for
 
table
 
wines
 
impose
 
on
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
4.6.  Would  an  alternative  that  allowed  table  wines  to  indicate  alcohol  content  as  
a
 
range
 
(e.g.,
 
7–14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume)
 
place
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers?
 
Would
 
this
 
approach
 
provide
 
sufficient
 
information
 
to
 
consumers?
 
 
 
Should
 
a
 
canned
 
Vodka
 
Soda
 
of
 
14%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
carry
 
the
 
same
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
as
 
a
 
7%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
Vodka
 
Soda?
 
How
 
does
 
this
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
make
 
responsible
 
drinking
 
decisions?
 
And
 
how
 
does
 
this
 
make
 
sense
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
a
 
rulemaking
 
whose
 
primary
 
purpose,
 
according
 
to
 
TTB,
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
more
 
information?
 
 
A
 
14%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
serving
 
of
 
wine
 
contains
 
twice
 
the
 
alcohol
 
of
 
a
 
7%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
20   
serving.  Stated  another  way,  it  contains  100%  more  alcohol.  That  7  percentage  
point
 
tolerance
 
amounts
 
to
 
a
 
100%
 
tolerance.
 
Yet
 
the
 
two
 
can
 
currently
 
be
 
labeled
 
the
 
same,
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
rulemaking
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
proposes
 
a
 
20%
 
tolerance
 
for
 
calorie
 
content
 
labeling
 
TTB
 
is
 
considering
 
extending
 
this
 
regulation
 
into
 
the
 
future.
 
This
 
pair
 
of
 
rules,
 
taken
 
together,
 
say
 
that
 
it’s
 
more
 
important
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
calories
 
you’re
 
consuming
 
than
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
alcohol
 
you’re
 
consuming.
 
That
 
is
 
completely
 
backwards.
 
 
From
 
spirit
 
producers’
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
this
 
is
 
especially
 
intolerable
 
when
 
our
 
allowable
 
tolerance
 
is
 
so
 
small,
 
and
 
when
 
a
 
looser
 
tolerance
 
for
 
small
 
distillers
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
negligible
 
impact
 
on
 
revenue
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
expected
 
number
 
based
 
on
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
5.  Placement  of  Alcohol  Content  Statements  as  Part  of  the  Alcohol  
Facts
 
Statement
 
5.1.  Would  it  be  easier  for  consumers  to  locate  alcohol  content  information  on  a  
label
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
and
 
if
 
so,
 
why?
 
 
No.
 
Consumers
 
have
 
known
 
where
 
to
 
find
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
on
 
bottles
 
for
 
years.
 
We
 
have
 
seen
 
no
 
evidence
 
that
 
consumers
 
have
 
difficulty
 
locating
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
on
 
our
 
products,
 
so
 
why
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel?
 
5.2.  Alternatively,  should  TTB  allow  alcohol  content  labeling  as  an  optional  
element
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
an
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
statement
 
is
 
required,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
include
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement.
 
5.3.  Does  the  placement  of  alcohol  content  information  affect  costs  of  
compliance
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
If
 
so,
 
how?
 
 
Yes,
 
any
 
addition
 
of
 
new
 
labeling
 
elements
 
or
 
requirement
 
that
 
existing
 
required
 
elements
 
be
 
relocated
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
additional
 
graphic
 
design
 
and
 
printing
 
fees
 
for
 
our
 
members.
 
5.4.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  alcohol  content  information  as  part  of  the  
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
affect
 
competition
 
or
 
issues
 
addressed
 
by
 
international
 
trade
 
agreements
 
or
 
international
 
standards?
 
 
Yes,
 
every
 
additional
 
regulatory
 
cost
 
or
 
burden
 
is
 
felt
 
disproportionately
 
by
 
small
 
businesses.
 
21   
6.  Mandatory  Statement  of  Alcohol  in  Fluid  Ounces  of  Pure  Alcohol  per  
Serving
 
 
6.1.  Would  including  information  about  the  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  
per
 
serving
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
improve
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
consumers
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
consumption
 
and
 
moderation
 
advice
 
provided
 
by
 
governmental
 
and
 
health
 
agencies,
 
if
 
they
 
so
 
choose?
 
 
Consumers  are  not  familiar  with  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  as  a  unit-  this  
is
 
meaningless
 
to
 
consumers.
 
6.2.  Would  requiring  information  about  the  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  
per
 
serving
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
burdens
 
for
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
for
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
 
Every
 
regulatory
 
requirement
 
disproportionately
 
burdens
 
small
 
businesses.
 
However,
 
if
 
TTB
 
proceeds
 
by
 
requiring
 
some
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
adding
 
this
 
particular
 
piece
 
of
 
info
 
does
 
not
 
add
 
a
 
meaningful
 
burden,
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
simple
 
calculation.
 
6.3.  Is  there  a  better  way  of  presenting  the  volume  of  alcohol  content  per  
serving?
 
Specifically,
 
should
 
the
 
term
 
‘‘standard
 
drink’’
 
be
 
defined
 
and
 
used
 
in
 
place
 
of
 
or
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
pure
 
ethyl
 
alcohol
 
per
 
serving?
 
 
See
 
above-
 
if
 
TTB
 
does
 
implement
 
a
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
ACSA
 
supports
 
including
 
either
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
content
 
or
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
ounces
 
of
 
pure
 
ethyl
 
alcohol
 
per
 
serving.
 
6.4.  TTB  notes  that  the  Dietary  Guidelines  for  Americans,  2020–2025,  use  the  
terms
 
‘‘drink,’’
 
and
 
‘‘alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent,’’
 
and
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
any
 
of
 
those
 
terms
 
should
 
be
 
used
 
or
 
defined
 
for
 
use
 
on
 
labels.
 
 
 
“Alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent”
 
is
 
unnecessarily
 
garbled.
 
While
 
many
 
consumers
 
understand
 
what
 
a
 
“drink”
 
is,
 
few
 
have
 
ever
 
encountered
 
the
 
phrase
 
“alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent.”
 
If
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
providing
 
consumers
 
information,
 
provide
 
it
 
in
 
simple
 
terms
 
they
 
understand.
 
“Standard
 
Drink”
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
well
 
understood.
 
6.5.  Should  the  proposed  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  statement  include  a  
summary
 
of
 
the
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines’
 
advice
 
on
 
moderate
 
drinking
 
(to
 
be
 
updated
 
based
 
on
 
any
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
guidelines
 
over
 
time)?
 
TTB
 
also
 
specifically
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
these
 
proposals
 
would
 
provide
 
useful
 
information
 
to
 
consumers
 
or
 
would
 
instead
 
be
 
confusing
 
or
 
misleading,
 
and
 
whether
 
inclusion
 
of
 
these
 
elements
 
would
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
compliance
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens.
 
 
22   
 
No.
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines
 
are
 
revised
 
as
 
frequently
 
as
 
every
 
five
 
years.
 
Five
 
years
 
is
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
timeline
 
for
 
compliance
 
with
 
a
 
new
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
requirement
 
in
 
large
 
part
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
and
 
difficulty
 
associated
 
with
 
changing
 
labels.
 
Requiring
 
inclusion
 
of
 
information
 
that
 
can
 
change
 
every
 
five
 
years
 
would
 
not
 
only
 
be
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
for
 
our
 
small
 
business
 
members
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
with,
 
but
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
a
 
compliance
 
nightmare.
 
A
 
bottle
 
of
 
our
 
products
 
might
 
live
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
for
 
months
 
or
 
years
 
after
 
it
 
is
 
produced,
 
producing
 
considerable
 
opportunities
 
for
 
confusion
 
here.
 
 
7.  Statements  of  Average  Analysis  and  Serving  Facts  Statements   
7.1.  N/A  
8.  Linear  Display,  Type  Size,  and  Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  
Information
 
 
8.1.  Would  consumers  have  trouble  locating  Alcohol  Facts  information  if  that  
information
 
is
 
presented
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display?
 
 
 
No,
 
they
 
would
 
not
 
have
 
trouble
 
locating
 
this
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display.
 
While
 
smaller
 
than
 
the
 
large
 
proposed
 
panel
 
display,
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
is
 
nonetheless
 
quite
 
large.
 
Compare
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
required
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Content
 
Statement
 
under
 
current
 
regulations.
 
 
 
ACSA
 
considers
 
Alcohol
 
Content
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
single
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
for
 
consumers
 
on
 
an
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
label.
 
The
 
linear
 
display
 
example
 
for
 
a
 
50-mL
 
container
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
provided
 
by
 
TTB
 
in
 
the
 
NPRM
 
is
 
many
 
times
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
a
 
standard
 
statement
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
on
 
a
 
50-mL
 
container
 
under
 
current
 
rules.
 
If
 
consumers
 
have
 
for
 
decades
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
most
 
important
 
information
 
at
 
that
 
tiny
 
size,
 
the
 
panel
 
size
 
is
 
surely
 
large
 
enough
 
to
 
communicate
 
calorie
 
content
 
and
 
redundant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information.
 
 
ACSA
 
supports
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
option
 
to
 
include
 
any
 
additional
 
required
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning
 
statement.
 
 
Containers
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
are
 
by
 
definition
 
quite
 
a
 
manageable
 
size,
 
since
 
the
 
largest
 
possible
 
container
 
now
 
is
 
3.75L,
 
and
 
therefore
 
any
 
required
 
information
 
contained
 
on
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
labels
 
in
 
a
 
compliant
 
manner
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
too
 
difficult
 
for
 
a
 
consumer
 
to
 
find.
 
We
 
therefore
 
urge
 
TTB,
 
if
 
it
 
does
 
adopt
 
these
 
rules,
 
not
 
to
 
follow
 
in
 
FDA’s
 
footsteps
 
as
 
FDA
 
considers
 
requiring
 
nutritional
 
info
 to  be  disclosed  on  the  front  of  food  products.  See  Docket  No.  FDA-2024-N-2910.   
23   
 
If
 
in
 
enacting
 
these
 
regulations
 
TTB
 
decides
 
to
 
adhere
 
closely
 
to
 
FDA
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
rules
 
going
 
forward,
 
and
 
TTB
 
follows
 
FDA
 
on
 
moving
 
nutritional
 
info
 
panels
 
to
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
packaging
 
some
 
years
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
this
 
change
 
would
 
even
 
further
 
burden
 
small
 
businesses
 
who
 
by
 
this
 
point
 
would
 
already
 
have
 
redesigned
 
and
 
reproduced
 
their
 
labels
 
and
 
associated
 
production
 
tooling.
 
FDA’s
 
change
 
will
 
not
 
burden
 
small
 
businesses,
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
exempt
 
from
 
its
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
rules,
 
but
 
if
 
TTB
 
continues
 
to
 
refuse
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses,
 
this
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
concerning
 
development.
 
8.2.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  the  linear  display  to  appear  in  a  box  with  the  
title
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
in
 
bold-face
 
type
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
better
 
locate
 
the
 
information?
 
Alternatively,
 
should
 
industry
 
members
 
be
 
allowed
 
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
surrounded
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
 
Bold-face
 
type
 
and
 
a
 
box
 
are
 
not
 
necessary
 
for
 
a
 
linear
 
display.
 
Alcohol
 
content,
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
for
 
consumers
 
on
 
an
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
label,
 
has
 
for
 
decades
 
been
 
permitted
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
in
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
formats
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
it
 
meets
 
legibility
 
and
 
type
 
size
 
requirements.
 
Requiring
 
redundant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information
 
and
 
calorie
 
counts
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
more
 
prominently
 
and
 
with
 
less
 
flexibility
 
does
 
not
 
make
 
sense.
 
8.3.  Do  consumers,  industry  members,  or  other  interested  parties  have  
comments
 
on
 
the
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
general
 
formatting
 
requirements
 
proposed
 
for
 
both
 
linear
 
displays
 
and
 
panels?
 
 
If
 
TTB
 
has
 
not
 
received
 
an
 
avalanche
 
of
 
consumer
 
comments
 
suggesting
 
that
 
current
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
rules
 
for
 
statements
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
are
 
insufficient,
 
ACSA
 
does
 
not
 
see
 
a
 
compelling
 
reason
 
for
 
this
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
to
 
have
 
any
 
additional
 
requirements.
 
The
 
current
 
rules
 
for
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
are
 
adequate
 
to
 
communicate
 
vital
 
health
 
and
 
safety
 
information
 
to
 
consumers,
 
while
 
also
 
giving
 
the
 
industry
 
latitude
 
to
 
create
 
attractive
 
and
 
original
 
label
 
designs.
 
We
 
support
 
this
 
flexible
 
yet
 
effective
 
form
 
of
 
display
 
requirements.
 
8.4.  How  would  the  proposed  formatting  requirements,  including  the  linear  
display
 
option,
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
formatting
 
requirements?
 
 
 
The
 
more
 
rigid
 
the
 
display
 
requirements,
 
the
 
more
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
the
 
regulation.
 
A
 
box
 
of
 
specific
 
sizes
 
and
 
proportions
 
is
 
more
 
difficult
 
to
 
fit
 
into
 
existing
 
label
 
artwork
 
than
 
a
 
few
 
lines
 
of
 
text.
 
Graphic
 
design
 
fees
 
are
 
extremely
 
expensive
 
to
 
our
 
small
 
businesses,
 
often
 
running
 
into
 
the
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
 
If
 
TTB
 
does
 
implement
 
a
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
ACSA
 
strongly
 
24   
urges  it  to  allow  the  statement  to  appear  in  the  widest  possible  variety  of  formats,  
with
 
the
 
most
 
flexibility
 
extended
 
to
 
small
 
producers.
 
8.5.  Should  TTB  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  mandatory  
statements
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
appear
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
For
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
should
 
TTB
 
remove
 
the
 
maximum
 
type
 
size
 
limitation
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
that
 
may
 
appear
 
elsewhere
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
well?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
the
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverage
 
industries
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
8.6.  What  alternatives  exist  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers?  
How,
 
if
 
it
 
all,
 
would
 
the
 
alternatives
 
affect
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
displaying
 
the
 
information
 
as
 
proposed
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
aligning
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
 
 
ACSA
 
strongly
 
urges
 
TTB
 
to
 
consider
 
permitting
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
online
 
via
 
QR
 
code.
 
Alternatively,
 
ACSA
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
information
 
TTB
 
ultimately
 
requires
 
to
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
to
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
labels.
 
 
Without
 
an
 
exemption
 
for
 
small
 
businesses,
 
alternatives
 
for
 
display
 
would
 
provide
 
the
 
best
 
effect
 
on
 
competition
 
for
 
small
 
distillers.
 
Large
 
international
 
corporations
 
that
 
dominate
 
the
 
industry
 
have
 
massive
 
budgets
 
for
 
branding
 
and
 
graphic
 
design.
 
They
 
can
 
afford
 
the
 
six-figure
 
design
 
fees
 
of
 
the
 
world’s
 
top
 
packaging
 
designers,
 
who
 
will
 
find
 
attractive
 
ways
 
to
 
fit
 
this
 
new
 
information
 
onto
 
their
 
labels.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
much
 
more
 
difficult
 
for
 
our
 
members
 
to
 
fit
 
large,
 
unsightly
 
displays
 
onto
 
our
 
packaging.
 
 
Our
 
labels
 
are
 
often
 
the
 
only
 
opportunity
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
an
 
impression
 
on
 
consumers.
 
We
 
can’t
 
afford
 
global
 
ad
 
campaigns
 
to
 
promote
 
brand
 
awareness-
 
if
 
we’re
 
lucky
 
enough
 
to
 
get
 
on
 
a
 
shelf,
 
that’s
 
often
 
the
 
only
 
place
 
a
 
consumer
 
will
 
ever
 
see
 
our
 
product
 
or
 
our
 
name.
 
If
 
new
 
requirements
 
make
 
it
 
more
 
difficult
 
for
 
our
 
products
 
to
 
look
 
attractive,
 
to
 
communicate
 
our
 
story,
 
and
 
to
 
stand
 
out,
 
that
 
will
 
become
 
even
 
harder.
 
 
More
 
compact
 
display
 
alternatives
 
not
 
only
 
provide
 
more
 
flexibility
 
within
 
existing
 
labels,
 
they
 
also
 
help
 
remove
 
the
 
unappealing
 
alternative
 
of
 
adding
 
an
 
additional
 
small
 
label.
 
Most
 
small
 
distillers
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
automated
 
labeling
 
machinery-
 
many
 
of
 
us
 
label
 
by
 
hand
 
or
 
with
 
manually
 
operated
 
machinery.
 
This
 
makes
 
packaging
 
labor
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
expensive
 
parts
 
of
 
our
 
products.
 
Adding
 
a
 
separate
 
sticker
 
just
 
for
 
this
 
information
 
would
 
add
 
considerable
 
additional
 
labor
 
cost
 
and
 
burden
 
over
 
time.
 
 
25   
The  EU,  which  generally  has  stricter  requirements  than  the  US  for  consumer  
product
 
labeling,
 
such
 
as
 
in
 
its
 
tobacco
 
products
 
regulation,
 
allows
 
nutritional
 
info
 
to
 
be
 
shared
 
by
 
QR
 
code.
 
8.7.  If  TTB  adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  for  alcohol  beverages,  
should
 
it
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
satisfying
 
the
 
requirement
 
by
 
making
 
the
 
information
 
available
 
electronically,
 
for
 
example
 
by
 
including
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
to
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
view
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
the
 
product
 
label?
 
Would
 
this
 
option
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
sufficient
 
access
 
to
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
at
 
the
 
retail
 
store
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions,
 
given
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
potential
 
issues
 
regarding
 
the
 
adequacy
 
of
 
cellular
 
or
 
Wi-Fi
 
coverage
 
at
 
some
 
retail
 
stores,
 
and
 
other
 
potential
 
technological
 
challenges?
 
Would
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
disclosures
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
create
 
disproportional
 
barriers
 
to
 
access
 
for
 
particular
 
communities?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
TTB
 
adopts
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements,
 
TTB
 
should
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
make
 
required
 
information
 
available
 
electronically.
 
This
 
would
 
not
 
create
 
a
 
meaningful
 
barrier
 
to
 
access
 
to
 
information.
 
 
According
 
to
 
Pew
 
Research,
 
in
 
2024,
 
91%
 
of
 
Americans
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone.
 
This
 
constitutes
 
a
 
ten
 
percentage
 
point
 
increase
 
from
 
five
 
years
 
earlier,
 
in
 
2019,
 
when
 
81%
 
of
 
Americans
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone.
 
Five
 
years
 
from
 
now,
 
when
 
these
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
regulations
 
would
 
be
 
implemented,
 
that
 
number
 
will
 
be
 
even
 
closer
 
to
 
100%.
 
Those
 
who
 
don’t
 
own
 
smartphones
 
are
 
disproportionately
 
those
 
not
 
yet
 
of
 
drinking
 
age,
 
who
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
of
 
concern
 
in
 
this
 
rulemaking. 
8.8.  How  would  the  option  of  disclosing  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  
information
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
disclosure
 
via
 
electronic
 
means?
 
 
 
Disclosing
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
less
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
QR
 
codes
 
take
 
up
 
very
 
little
 
space
 
on
 
a
 
label
 
and
 
would
 
create
 
very
 
limited
 
additional
 
graphic
 
design,
 
printing,
 
and
 
bottling
 
labor
 
costs.
 
Adding
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
to
 
a
 
website
 
costs
 
very
 
little.
 
 
8.9.  If  TTB  were  to  allow  mandatory  information  to  be  disclosed  electronically,  
should
 
TTB
 
allow
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
electronically
 
or
 
should
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
 
 
If
 
any
 
form
 
of
 
labeling
 
is
 
mandated
 
for
 
small
 
business
 
by
 
TTB,
 
a
 
hybrid
 
digital
 
-
 
printed
 
solution
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
less
 
burdensome
 
to
 
our
 
small
 
and
 
even
 
26   
medium-sized  business  members.   
 
For
 
example,
 
requiring
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
calories
 
that
 
follows
 
the
 
same
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
requirements
 
as
 
the
 
current
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
would
 
be
 
relatively
 
trivial,
 
even
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.
 
To
 
address
 
concerns
 
about
 
other
 
nutritional
 
info,
 
TTB
 
could
 
require
 
a
 
statement
 
to
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
“alcoholic
 
beverages
 
contain
 
no
 
nutritive
 
value”
 
to
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning.
 
Any
 
other
 
required
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
carbohydrate
 
and
 
protein
 
content,
 
could
 
be
 
made
 
available
 
online.
 
8.10.  If  TTB  allowed  multiple  options  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  
consumers,
 
could
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
uniformity
 
create
 
consumer
 
confusion?
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
note
 
that
 
FDA
 
finds
 
compelling
 
interest
 
in
 
small
 
business
 
protection
 
to
 
be
 
balanced
 
with
 
consumer
 
interests.
 
For
 
large
 
producers,
 
uniformity
 
of
 
information,
 
not
 
of
 
display,
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
believe
 
to
 
matter.
 
TTB’s
 
existing
 
rules
 
for
 
the
 
statement
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
guide
 
here.
 
Alcohol
 
content
 
must
 
be
 
stated
 
as
 
a
 
percent
 
by
 
volume,
 
while
 
an
 
additional
 
statement
 
in
 
proof
 
may
 
be
 
stated,
 
but
 
the
 
specifics
 
of
 
how
 
this
 
appears
 
visually
 
are
 
quite
 
flexible.
 
This
 
provides
 
vital
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
consistent
 
format,
 
but
 
gives
 
brands
 
design
 
flexibility
 
and
 
gives
 
consumers
 
credit
 
for
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
understand
 
clearly
 
displayed
 
information.
 
9.  Serving  Size  Reference  Amounts   
9.1.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  a  reasonably  accurate  representation  
of
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
serving?
 
If
 
not,
 
what
 
data
 
or
 
other
 
information
 
should
 
TTB
 
consider
 
that
 
would
 
give
 
a
 
better
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
amount
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
product
 
category?
 
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
follow
 
CDC’s
 
definitions
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
in
 
determining
 
allowable
 
serving
 
sizes,
 
but
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
understanding
 
that
 
the
 
definitions
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
standard
 
drinks
 
assume
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
40%.
 
9.2.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  more  accurate  than  the  serving  sizes  
set
 
forth
 
in
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2004–1
 
(1.5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
wines,
 
and
 
12
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
regardless
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content)?
 
Why

be
 
counterproductive
 
to
 
efforts

9.3.  Should  TTB  allow  greater  flexibility  in  serving  sizes?   
 
No.
 
If
 
serving
 
sizes
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
required
 
part
 
of
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
labels,
 
they
 
should
 
make
 
clear
 
to
 
consumers
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
given
 
product
 
constitutes
 
a
 
standard
 
drink.
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
a
 
non-resealable
 
container
 
like
 
a
 
can,
 
communicating
 
that
 
it
 
contains
 
1.5
 
drinks
 
is
 
useful
 
information.
 
9.4.  Should  the  serving  size  reference  amounts  be  exactly  equal  to  an  alcoholic  
drink
 
equivalent
 
of
 
0.6
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
would
 
this
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
not
 
recognizing
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
typically
 
consumed?
 
 
 
If
 
communicated
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
this
 
would
 
introduce
 
confusion.
 
Consumers
 
do
 
not
 
think
 
about
 
alcohol
 
in
 
this
 
way
 
and
 
would
 
be
 
likely
 
to
 
misinterpret
 
this
 
information.
 
 
But
 
if
 
.6
 
fluid
 
oz
 
of
 
alcohol
 
is
 
just
 
the
 
behind-the-scenes
 
basis
 
for
 
calculating
 
the

that
 
would
 
be
 
very
 
reasonable.
 
 
10.  Dual-Column  Alcohol  Facts  Panel  Display  
10.1.  Does  dual-column  labeling  create  the  impression  that  consumption  of  
multiple
 
servings
 
of
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
at
 
one
 
time
 
is
 
expected
 
or
 
recommended?
 
 
 
No
 
more
 
so
 
than
 
it
 
does
 
for
 
food
 
products.
 
10.2.  Should  dual-column  displays  be  limited  to  containers  with  three  or  fewer  
servings,
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FDA
 
regulations?
 
Or
 
is
 
a
 
limit
 
of
 
less
 
than
 
five
 
servings
 
better
 
suited
 
to
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
may
 
be
 
bottled
 
and
 
labeled?

10.3.  Should  dual-column  displays  be  allowed  on  any  container,  regardless  of  
the
 
number
 
of
 
servings
 
in
 
that
 
container,
 
consistent
 
with
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2013–2?
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
would
 
require
 
containers
 
with
 
a
 
net
 
content
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
100
 
percent
 
but
 
less
 
than
 
200
 
percent
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
serving
 
size
 
reference
 
amount
 
to
 
be
 
labeled
 
as
 
containing
 
a
 
single
 
serving.
 
TTB
 
solicits
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
convey
 
the
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutrient
 
content
 
of
 
these
 
products
 
to
 
consumers.
 
 
We
 
see
 
no
 
reason
 
to
 
forbid
 
dual-column
 
displays
 
on
 
any
 
container.
 
If
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
panels
 
are
 
intended
 
to
 
give
 
consumers
 
easier
 
access
 
to
 
information,
 
then
 
28   
permit  those  producers  who  wish  to  provide  an  easier  way  to  understand  that  
information
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
11.  Implementation  Period   
11.1.  How  frequently  do  bottlers  and  importers  of  alcohol  beverages  typically  
change
 
labels?
 
 
The
 
only
 
accurate
 
answer
 
to
 
this
 
is
 
“it
 
depends.”
 
Printing
 
labels
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
areas
 
of
 
our
 
industry
 
that
 
is
 
most
 
affected
 
by
 
economies
 
of
 
scale.
 
The
 
unit
 
cost
 
of
 
printing
 
the
 
same
 
exact
 
label
 
might
 
go
 
from
 
ten
 
cents
 
apiece
 
for
 
an
 
order
 
of
 
tens
 
of
 
thousands
 
to
 
several
 
dollars
 
apiece
 
for
 
an
 
order
 
of
 
a
 
couple
 
hundred.
 
As
 
such,
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
order
 
large
 
quantities
 
of
 
labels
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
use
 
for
 
years
 
to
 
decrease
 
unit
 
costs.
 
But
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
might
 
print
 
smaller
 
runs
 
more
 
frequently.
 
Some
 
members
 
only
 
make
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
products
 
that
 
stay
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
years.
 
Some
 
members
 
only
 
make
 
limited
 
release
 
products
 
and
 
require
 
new
 
labels
 
many
 
times
 
a
 
year
 
for
 
each
 
new
 
product.
 
Many
 
members
 
pursue
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
the
 
above
 
strategies.
 
11.2.  How  long  do  industry  members  need  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  
the
 
proposed
 
rule?
 
 
If
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule
 
goes
 
through
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses,
 
5
 
years
 
is
 
an
 
appropriate
 
implementation
 
timeline.
 
11.3.  Will  5  years  provide  enough  time  for  small  businesses  to  coordinate  
labeling
 
changes
 
required
 
by
 
regulatory
 
changes
 
with
 
labeling
 
changes
 
that
 
are
 
planned
 
in
 
the
 
ordinary
 
course
 
of
 
business?
 
 
 
We
 
urge
 
that
 
TTB
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
Small
 
businesses
 
are
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
implement
 
changes
 
to
 
their
 
labels
 
significant
 
enough
 
to
 
require
 
new
 
graphic
 
design
 
or
 
even
 
new
 
tooling
 
every
 
5
 
years
 
since
 
the
 
expense
 
is
 
significant.
 
Usually
 
a
 
small
 
business
 
will
 
spend
 
a
 
significant
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
in
 
branding
 
and
 
design
 
once
 
every
 
10
 
years
 
for
 
its
 
most
 
popular
 
products.
 
11.4.  Is  5  years  too  long  a  compliance  period?  Should  the  compliance  period  
instead
 
be
 
2
 
years,
 
3
 
years,
 
or
 
another
 
length
 
of
 
time?
 
 
 
For
 
large
 
companies,
 
every
 
5
 
years
 
should
 
be
 
fine.
 
For
 
small
 
companies,
 
there
 
should
 
be
 
an
 
exemption
 
process
 
available
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
with
 
food
 
products.
 
11.5.  If  a  final  rule  is  issued,  will  industry  members  begin  implementation  of  the  
labeling
 
changes
 
in
 
advance
 
of
 
the
 
compliance
 
date?
 
 
Some
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
if
 
it
 
aligns
 
with
 
their
 
priorities
 
and
 
needs.

Subject: Comments on: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages  
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance , a strategic collaboration  among 
companies and with institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable development of Mezcal. Its 
purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint 
projects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  
solutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines 
Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT 
Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in 
accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical 
regulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial 
proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods 
 
Key points of the proposal: 
• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol 
content per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number 
of servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of 
alcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   
• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal 
Register is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
General comments on the proposal:  
 
Alcohol content 
It is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to 
inform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by 
the average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, 
and that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without 
requiring placement in a specific panel or format. 
 
Serving and servings per container: 
The proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container 
across all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. 
While it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in 
a standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If 
mandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), 
which would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or 
commercial burdens. 
 
Nutritional information 
 
The proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and 
proteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may 
confuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol 
 
should not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into 
viewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions 
based on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol 
consumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. 
 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? 
Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it 
unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food 
labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful 
information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by 
implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily 
nutrient requirements? 
 
We believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any 
benefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is 
to prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could 
create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among 
consumers. 
 
We consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, 
sugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier 
than other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could 
confuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium 
content, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the 
consumer's diet and are not comparable. 
 
By its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental 
information on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that 
alcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision 
and favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of 
alcohol that each product contains. 
 
Making this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which 
goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  
trade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this 
information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible 
to consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
• Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Easy updating as regulations change. 
• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of 
harmful alcohol consumption. 
• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement 
these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in 
the U.S. 
 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
 
As previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels 
could lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious 
confusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) 
shows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is 
clear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion 
or misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. 
 
 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
 
As previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers 
to believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements 
like dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not 
recommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such 
declarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. 
 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
 
Including nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly 
believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like 
dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such 
information should not be required in any form.  
 
In Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits 
or therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus 
solely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness 
benefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising 
with alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising 
Regulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. 
These declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health 
messaging. 
 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health 
benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations 
on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
 
 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
 
 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity 
and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts 
labeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with 
such revisions? 
 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" 
panel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and 
regulatory burdens. 
 
 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
  
Making a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, 
this proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be 
more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -
fulfilment would create”. 
 
8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in 
particular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially 
small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging 
and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. 
This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
 
To reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is 
recommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements 
internationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Detailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health 
benefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid 
regulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers.

WIRSPA Submission to the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
Regarding: TTB Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  and TTB Notice No. 238 – Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
1. Introduction 
The West Indies Rum & Spirits Producers’ Association (WIRSPA) represents producers 
and brand owners of Authentic Caribbean Rum and other spirits across 15 countries. Our 
members are long -established exporters to the United States, with many products 
benefiting from recognition under the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative. The rum industry is 
a major economic driver and an important part of the cultural heritage of the Caribbean, 
supporting thousands of jobs in both production and tourism.   We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on TTB’s proposed rulemaking under Notice No. 237 and Notice 
No. 238. WIRSPA supports the goal of providing consumers with accurate, clear, and 
accessible information. However, we believe that the proposed approach requires 
adjustments to ensure that it is: 
→ Meaningful for consumers  — avoiding duplication, overly technical terms, or 
misleading nutritional framing. 
→ Flexible for producers  — recognising varied product types, serving traditions, and 
container sizes. 
→ Aligned internationally — to minimise trade barriers and regulatory divergence with 
other major markets. 
→ Practical and proportionate  — limiting compliance burdens, especially for small 
producers, and avoiding unnecessary label changes. 
Key Requests at a Glance: 
1. Change the panel title from “Alcohol Facts” to “Serving Facts”. 
2. Permit digital labeling (QR codes) to provide full information, with minimal mandatory 
on-pack content. 
3. Remove “pure alcohol in fluid ounces” and keep ABV optional in the panel. 
4. Omit irrelevant nutrients. 
5. Adapt serving sizes to reflect real-world consumption; allow justified deviations. 
6. Allow flexible formatting, including linear formats without boxed borders. 
7. Maintain ±20% tolerance and avoid unnecessary COLA resubmissions. 2 
 
8. Support 5-year transition with stock sell -through and alignment with allergen labeling 
timelines. 
9. Confirm no allergen labeling for pre -distillation ingredients, with case -by-case post-
distillation checks. 
2. Title of the Statement 
The proposed title “Alcohol Facts” risks misleading consumers into thinking that the 
panel offers a safety or health advisory, rather than factual serving information. It also 
differs from established voluntary practice and international norms. 
Argument: 
 “Serving Facts” is a more neutral, accurate descriptor. 
 The EU and many global producers already use “Serving Facts” or similar. 
 A consistent title fosters consumer understanding across markets. 
Conclusion / Ask: Replace “Alcohol Facts” with “Serving Facts” in all references and 
label examples. 
3. Digital Labeling (QR Codes and Online Access) 
The proposed rule requires all information to appear physically on the label, which can 
be restrictive for small containers, multilingual products, and brands selling in multiple 
markets. 
Argument: 
 Codex Guidelines (CXG 105 -2024) support the use of technology to deliver food and 
beverage information. 
 The EU already allows energy content on-pack with full nutrition information online . 
The Spirits Europe and DISCUS submission s both provide extensive background to 
justify this position. 
 Digital labeling reduces costs, supports sustainability, and avoids frequent reprints. 
 QR codes can provide richer, multilingual, and updated content. 
Conclusion / Ask: Allow mandatory particulars to be provided digitally via QR codes, with 
only essential on-label data required in physical print. 
4. Content of the Statement 
Several proposed elements are either duplicative or not relevant to distilled spirits. 
Argument: 
 ABV — already required elsewhere on the label; repeating it is redundant. 
 Fluid ounces of pure alcohol — unfamiliar to U.S. consumers and rarely used 
internationally. 
 Protein and fat — always negligible in distilled spirits; inclusion implies nutritional 
benefit. 3 
 
 Avoid adopting FDA -style nutrient label format –adopting FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” 
style could mislead consumers into thinking alcohol has health or nutritional benefits. 
Conclusion / Ask: Keep ABV optional in the panel; remove pure alcohol in fluid ounces; 
omit protein and fat unless above de minimis levels. 
5. Serving Sizes and Real-World Consumption 
The fixed ABV -based serving size table does not reflect actual consumption for many 
spirits categories. 
Argument: 
 Low-ABV liqueurs are often used in cocktails in portions smaller than proposed 
reference sizes. 
 High ABV spirits may be dispensed in smaller measures either on their own or as 
cocktail components, which is increasingly popular. 
 RTDs and high-ABV beers/ciders are often sold and consumed in containers larger 
than the proposed serving size. 
 FDA’s RACC methodology better matches consumer expectations. 
Conclusion / Ask: Greater flexibility on serving sizes – Allow sizes to reflect actual 
consumption patterns, product type, ABV, and category norms, rather than fixed ABV -
based thresholds. 
6. Format and Presentation 
The proposed boxed, prescriptive panel format is not always feasible, especially for small 
bottles or multi-market labels. Most spirits have applied label s which constrain the use 
of additional printed information. 
Argument: 
 Linear formats without a box can be clearer and more space efficient. 
 Excess formatting rules can create conflicts with other jurisdictions. 
Conclusion / Ask: Allow linear formats without boxed borders; permit integration with 
existing branding. 
7. Tolerances and Compliance 
Nutrient and alcohol content can vary slightly between production runs. 
Argument: 
 ±20% tolerance is reasonable and aligns with other jurisdictions. 
 Exempting minor 'Serving Facts' updates from COLA resubmission reduces burdens. 
Conclusion / Ask: Retain ±20% tolerance; avoid mandatory COLA resubmission for minor 
factual updates. 4 
 
8. Implementation Timeline and Stock Sell-Through 
Label changes are costly and time -consuming, especially for small -volume, long-shelf-
life products. 
Argument: 
 A 5-year transition is proportionate. 
 Stock sell-through avoids waste. 
 Coordinating allergen and nutrition changes reduces costs. 
Conclusion / Ask: Retain 5 -year transition; allow sell -through; align implementation 
dates for Notices 237 and 238. 
9. Allergen Labeling 
The proposed allergen labeling could unintentionally apply to ingredients used before 
distillation. 
Argument: 
 Scientific consensus supports exemption for allergens removed by distillation. 
 Many jurisdictions already exempt such cases. 
Conclusion / Ask: Confirm no allergen labeling for pre-distillation ingredients; apply case-
by-case checks for post-distillation additions. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to make a comment on these two important issues.

Red Stripe, pertaining to the US TTB Alcohol Facts Statements Proposed Rule: 
 
1. Support for Consumer Transparency and Public Health 
  
We support the intent of the proposed rule to provide consumers with clear, consistent, and 
accessible information regarding alcohol content, calories, and macronutrients. This aligns 
with public health goals and empowers consumers to make informed decisions. 
However, we urge TTB to ensure that the implementation of these requirements does not 
disproportionately burden small producers or create unintended barriers to market entry. 
  
2. Concerns Regarding Cost and Burden on Small Businesses 
While the proposed five-year compliance period is appreciated, we remain concerned about 
the cumulative costs of: 
• Label redesign and printing 
• Laboratory testing for nutrient content 
• Regulatory compliance and recordkeeping 
  
We recommend that TTB consider the following mitigations: 
• Providing a simplified compliance pathway for small producers, such as a tiered 
implementation schedule or reduced testing requirements. 
  
3. Flexibility in Label Format and Placement 
We support the proposed flexibility in allowing either panel or linear formats for the Alcohol 
Facts statement. This is particularly important for smaller containers and products with limited 
label space. 
We also support the removal of maximum type size restrictions and the allowance of dual-
column formats for multi-serving containers. 
  
4. Electronic Disclosure Options 
While we understand TTB’s concern about accessibility, we encourage the Bureau to 
reconsider allowing QR codes or web links as a supplemental—not exclusive—means of 
disclosure. This could reduce label clutter and allow for multilingual or dynamic content, 
especially for export markets. This is even more relevant in 2025 where in the USA nearly 90 % 
of the population owns a smartphone. 
  
5. Harmonization with FDA and International Standards 
We encourage TTB to continue aligning its labeling requirements with those of the FDA and 
international standards where feasible. This will reduce compliance complexity for producers 
operating across regulatory jurisdictions. 
  
6. Clarification on Alcohol Content Tolerances 
We support the proposed tolerances for alcohol content and nutrient declarations. However, 
we request clarification on how TTB will enforce these tolerances and whether periodic testing 
will be required post-implementation. 
  7. Implementation Timeline and COLA Flexibility 
  
We support the proposed five-year implementation period and the provision that new COLA 
applications will not be required solely for the addition of Alcohol Facts statements. This will 
significantly reduce administrative burden. 
  
8. Contrasting Label Background 
  
Additionally, please note that Red Stripe already discloses alcohol, calorie, and nutrient 
content on our labels in a clear and legible format, the introduction of a mandated contrasting 
background, without specific visual guidelines, poses practical concerns: 
• It could necessitate a complete redesign of label layouts across multiple SKUs, 
potentially impacting brand equity and incurring significant reprinting and compliance 
costs. 
• Without a clear and standardized definition of what qualifies as “contrasting,” there is a 
risk of inconsistent enforcement or rejection at port, which could disrupt exports. 
 
We would therefore recommend that TTB: 
• Provide clear design guidance or acceptable examples of compliant contrasting label 
background formats; 
• Allow some discretion in label design to preserve brand identity while meeting 
transparency objectives. 
  
Conclusion 
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking. We believe that with 
thoughtful adjustments, the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements can achieve their 
intended public health goals while minimizing undue burden on industry stakeholders.

Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages; and Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director, 
 
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide comments to The 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding  Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notice 
No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits. 
 
The SWA is the Scotch Whisky industry ’s trade association . We have over 90 member 
companies, from multinational spirits producers through to small family -run distillers, bottlers, 
blenders, and brand owners. Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky 
industry by production.  
 
Any rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the 
Scotch Whisky’s biggest market by value, with exports worth £971 million in 2024. In addition, 
many of our larger members are also investors in the United States. 
 
We fully support TTB's efforts to ensure that consumers have the relevant product information to 
make informed decisions. Our members have been doing this domestically and in their export 
markets, and consumers are already familiar with this practice. We w ould therefore like to 
submit specific comments below for your consideration on behalf of the Scotch Whisky industry. 
 
I. Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Additional on -product labelling requirements present numerous disadvantages both to 
consumers and businesses, particularly SMEs. Distilled spirits are one of the most highly 
regulated products in the United States, subject to rigorous pre -approval processes for labels 
and formulas. Despite this, the industry has proactively developed and implemented various 
self-regulatory initiatives to provide consumers with additional non -mandatory product 
information, exceeding TTB guidelines. For example, many distille rs already disclose allergen 
details and “Serving Facts” statements either on labels, websites, or via QR codes, 
SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237

demonstrating the industry’s leadership in enhancing product transparency. Companies using 
digital labelling in international markets have reported clear benefits.  
 
Voluntary information currently provided by our industry is displayed through a host of different 
means and formats . Specifying mandatory labelling requirements will  therefore inevitably cost 
every spirit producer, as they will be required to incur some form of label redesign and printing 
costs, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of product information.  The SWA 
therefore recommends retaining the voluntary approach to additional product information. 
However, should the TTB pursue a mandato ry regime, we recommend the following 
considerations be taken into account. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as 
flexible as possible, and do not result in unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while 
improving information to consumers. 
 
Product Information Statement: Serving Facts v. Alcohol Facts 
 
We recommend that the title of the alcohol beverages information statement be “Serving Facts” 
instead of “Alcohol Facts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the 
nutritional information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverag e. “Alcohol Facts” could 
confuse consumers as it may suggest that the statement includes general indications on the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages. In addition, consumers are accustomed to finding 
nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement because most operators who currently 
voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the title. Changing the labels of 
alcoholic beverages would generate additional costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors, negatively affecting an industry that already works well in disclosing information 
effectively. 
 
Display of the Product Information Statement: Digital labelling benefits  
 
We continue to recommend that “Serving Facts” information be allowed to be provided through 
digital labelling, particularly via digital QR codes. Spirits labels are already required to include a 
great deal of information in the same field of vision. Numero us studies have concluded that the 
more health information a physical label has, the less attention the consumer pays to that 
information. To avoid over-crowding labels, and consequently confusing consumers, any newly 
required information should be allowed to be provided through a website or QR code.  
 
While some consumer organisations oppose digital labelling on the grounds that it places the 
burden on consumers and puts them at a disadvantage , there are no significant studies that 
support this argument.  Digital labelling is not prohibitive for consumers considering that over 
90% of adult Americans own a smartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet.1 Notably, 
mobile phone ownership amongst senior citizens has been found to be as high as 94%, with 76% 
owning smartphones.2 The three largest phone carriers in the US currently each claim that their 
4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the US population, so consumers in both urban and 
rural areas should have access to the necessary coverage to access online information  in retail 
settings. Furthermore, digital labels can assist with accessibility requirements, facilitating 
product information in multiple languages and allowing auditory text -to-speech access on 
devices.

Some research suggests that gender, age, education and socioeconomic status might not have 
significant influence on intention to purchase product with a QR code applied to it.  Additionally, 
the presence of QR codes on products correlates to increased consumer comprehension and 
confidence about the product they are buying. It was likened to being in a traditional market, 
where one can speak to a vendor; a QR code allows the consu mer to find out much more than 
they would normally be able to do in a supermarket. QR codes also reduce the chances of there 
being multiple labels in market for the same brand as it goes through reformulation. This assists 
with avoiding consumer confusion when they encounter brand labels with different values side 
by side. Consumers are more trusting of digital label claims, in particular about the traceability 
of ingredients and components, manufacturing processes and environmental claims.3 
 
Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and user -friendly 
feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a smart phone 
or other electronic device. Digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: 
• Reduction of Costs for SMEs:  Digital labelling allows for quick adaptation to new legal 
requirements without having to design and print new labels. All companies, but 
especially SMEs, will reduce labelling costs and will have the opportunity to explore new 
export markets around the w orld, including the US. This will benefit foreign companies, 
but also US distillers, who will be able to use labels that are commonly used 
internationally with only additional information to be modified online. 
• Sustainability: digital labelling is beneficial for environmental protection, as  it reduces 
waste and costs associated with changes to traditional physical labels.  Many sectors 
(including the Scotch Whisky industry) are committed to sustainable packaging 
practices, of which labels are an essential part. The destruction of labels that are 
commonly used in the US market and the process of printing new la bels, with the 
significant amount of energy involved, will have a major environmental impact. This could 
be a recurring issue every time labelling regulations are updated. However, by using 
digital labelling businesses can reduce waste, conserve resources, and positively impact 
the environment. 
• Geo-specific information:  Recycling information and other sustainability -related 
information which are location -specific can easily be integrated into digital labels. One 
such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling information for glass 
bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels 
since last year.  
 
Digital labels have been broadly implemented as a solution to provide access to product 
information for consumers across Europe, and we believe this could be replicated for US 
consumers. The future of food and beverage labelling is digital. The use of this innovative 
measure is transformative and beneficial for the US market, where almost 97% of the population 
owns a mobile phone. Future trends predict that the number of American smartphone users 
will increase to more than 364 million people by 2040 4. Digital labelling would be more 
effective in enabling consumers to make informed choices about their health, dietary 
restrictions, and the environmental impact of their consumption.

In the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical 
label, we kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by 
a box. The space available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would 
unnecessarily take up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in 
bold type is sufficient to allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label.  
Furthermore, we request that TTB, at minimum, consider allowing producers to list only nutrients 
present in the product instead of having to print the entire statement with multiple zeros.  
We would like to stress that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement, technical 
regulations shall not be prepared, adopted, or applied with the purpose or effect of creating 
unnecessary obstacles to international trade to fulfill the legitimate objectives of member states. 
Content of Product Information Statement 
 
Distilled spirits are not significant sources of nutritional value for consumers. Scotch Whisky, 
under UK regulation, can only be produced in Scotland from cereals, water and yeast, with no 
flavourings or sweeteners. Because of the stringently regulated di stillation process, Scotch 
Whisky spirits do not contain carbohydrates, fat, or protein. Requiring extensive nutritional 
information on labels, especially when most of the nutritional facts are not applicable to distilled 
spirits, risks confusing consumers into the belief that they have a ""nutritional benefit” and that 
some alcoholic beverages are more nutritious than others. This is especially so if the statement 
contains additional information such as protein, vitamins and minerals, sodium, and further 
breakdown of fats, as considered in Notice No. 237.  
TTB asked for views on greater harmonization with the Food and Drug Administration’s  (FDA) 
nutrient content statements. We believe this would be unnecessary and misleading for the same 
reasons outlined above. No other country requires daily value information for listed nutrients on 
distilled spirits labels, as it would deviate from common global practices . It is well -understood 
that the consumption of spirits  provide no significant nutritional value and is not part of a 
consumer’s daily dietary needs. Furthermore, the adoption of FDA nutrition facts levels on spirits 
would also impose significant costs and burdens to our industry. 
The SWA therefore recommends that any nutritional information required to be provided under 
the “Serving Facts” be limited in scope and accessible via QR code. If the TTB adopts the 
requirement for a “Serving Facts” statement, the SWA would also recommend the following: 
• We welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations.  It 
would be beneficial for TTB to explicitly recognise that producers can continue to rely on 
databases and calculators to provide nutrient content information without having to 
undertake costly and burdensome laboratory testing on each of their products, 
particularly for brand extensions that might have variation in ABV from bottle to bottle, 
such as cask-strength whiskies. 
• The “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the alcohol content 
statement. For distilled spirits, the ABV is already required to appear in the same field of 
vision as the brand name and the class designation. Consumers are accustomed to  
finding this information on the main/front label. Particularly in the case of physical labels, 
space is limited and including it to the “Serving Facts” would not add any value.  
• We kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the 
“Serving Facts” statement optional. Providing this information without context would not 
necessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pur e 
alcohol is not well understood. The presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the 
provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237  
 
5 
 
drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary Guidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a 
physical label. 
• We would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes , which can 
vary from country to country depending on the ABV of the product. For instance, Scotch 
Whisky has a wide variety of products, some of which go beyond 40% ABV and for which 
the serving size would differ. Furthermore, r igid one-size-fits-all serving size 
requirements based on ABV could lead to several unintended consequences.  This 
includes consumers incorrectly conflat ing “serving size” with recommended 
consumption amount, the latter of which may drastically differ depending on the brand 
and ABV. This is especially so when the spirit is consumed as part of a mixed drink. Rigid 
serving sizes may undermine brand integrity and inadvertently encourage higher alcohol 
and calorie consumption. For these reasons, we recommend TTB’s proposed serving size 
guidelines remain optional, while permitting customized serving sizes where justified by 
product type and consumption patterns. 
• We welcome the fact that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA applications 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the “Serving 
Facts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the 
inclusion or al teration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” 
statement in this manner. 
 
Compliance Period, Stock Exhaustion, Alignment with TTB Notice No. 238  
 
In the event the proposed rulemaking contained in Notice No. 237 is adopted, the SWA endorses 
the proposed transition period of 5 years. Any shorter period for compliance would present 
difficulties for our members given our sector’s current economic climate. 
Furthermore, we would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock 
which was put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of 
our products can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. 
Finally, we further recommend that its implementation is aligned with that of Notice No. 238 on 
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, along with any other 
ingredient labeling proposal TTB might be considering . This would allow businesses to comply 
with all labelling requirements within similar implementation periods.  
In conclusion, the Scotch Whisky industry remains firmly committed to ensuring consumers 
have access to clear and relevant product information. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to 
carefully assess the potential impact of any new requirements —both to a void placing undue 
burdens on businesses, particularly SMEs, and to prevent consumer confusion regarding the 
nature of our products. 
 
Yours sincerely,

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
The undersigned organizations call on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to finalize 
the proposed rule mandating on-package labeling of alcohol content and nutritional information. These 
rules will be a step forward, as current alcohol labels do not provide the information that consumers need 
to make informed purchasing and consumption decisions. 
 
The “Alcohol Facts” panel set forth by the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of 
calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”
1  
While this information represents a major step forward, the rule could be strengthened by additionally 
requiring sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in milligrams, percent 
Daily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, number of standard drinks per container, the 
conversion between standard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and the 2020-2025 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans moderate drinking advice. The final rule should also make dual-column 
labeling mandatory. 
This additional information is important as part of a commonsense approach to promoting transparency, 
health, and safety for those who consume alcohol. Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various 
harms including motor vehicle accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.2 
Alcoholic beverages may also contribute to other forms of diet-related chronic disease as alcohol is 
calorie-dense and on average accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.3 Many alcoholic 
beverages also contain carbohydrates, added sugars, and other nutrients to limit. Alcohol content labeling 
is a straightforward approach that increases consumer awareness of the contents of alcoholic beverages 
through greater transparency.4 
 
Consumers desire this information and would use it to make decisions about alcohol consumption and 
purchasing. In a March 2024 poll of 1,509 adults who drink alcohol (commissioned by CSPI and 
conducted by Big Village), strong majorities (78-90%) said alcohol content, calorie content, and 
nutritional content, would be at least somewhat important for their alcohol purchasing decisions.
5 
 
We agree with the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on-
package and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this would 
specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology 
(including those who are older or living rurally). 
 
We urge TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts rule to ensure 
that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. To ensure timely 
consumer access to this important information, the final rule should adopt a shorter compliance period of 
3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed.

We
 
respectfully
 
submit
 
the
 
following
 
comments
 
on
 
TTB
 
Notice
 
237:
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
  Background   On  January  17,  2025   TTB  published  Notice  237:  Alcohol  Facts  Statements  in  the  Labeling  of  
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
18
 
years
 
since
 
TTB
 
last
 
proposed
 
substantive
 
changes
 
to
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labeling,
 
including
 
serving
 
facts
 
and
 
nutrition
 
information.
 
On  July  31,  2007,  TTB  published  Notice  No.  73,  a  proposed  rule  entitled  “Labeling  and  
Advertising
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages”.
 
In
 
that
 
document,
 
TTB
 
proposed
 
to
 
amend
 
the
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
to
 
set
 
forth
 
requirements
 
for
 
mandatory
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
presentation
 
of
 
certain
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
mandatory
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
panel.
 
The
 
proposed
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
panel
 
would
 
also
 
have
 
included
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
servings
 
per
 
container
 
and
 
the
 
serving
 
size.
 
TTB
 
did
 
not
 
finalize
 
the
 
rulemaking;
 
however,
 
on
 
May
 
28,
 
2013,
 
TTB
 
published
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2013-2,
 
Voluntary
 
Nutrient
 
Content
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
and
 
Advertising
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
The
 
ruling
 
announced
 
that
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels
 
could
 
include
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
a
 
voluntary
 
basis
 
while
 
the
 
Bureau
 
continued
 
to
 
consider
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
TTB
 
withdrew
 
the
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
rulemaking
 
from
 
the
 
Unified
 
Agenda
 
of
 
Federal
 
Regulatory
 
and
 
Deregulatory
 
Actions
 
in
 
the
 
fall
 
of
 
2017.
 
In  the  intervening  years,  the  TTB  has  received  letters  from  various  groups  to  revisit  the  potential  
for
 
changes
 
to
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labels.
 
Additionally,
 
in
 
2022
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury
 
issued
 
a
 
report,
 
“Competition
 
in
 
the
 
Markets
 
for
 
Beer,
 
Wine,
 
and
 
Spirits.”
 
The
 
competition
 
report
 
recommended
 
that
 
TTB
 
should
 
revive
 
or
 
initiate
 
rulemaking
 
proposing
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
and
 
mandatory  information  on  alcohol  content,  nutritional  content,  and  appropriate  serving  sizes.  
Consistent
 
with
 
that
 
recommendation,
 
TTB
 
published
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232,
 
which
 
announced
 
two
 
virtual
 
listening
 
sessions,
 
on
 
February
 
28
 
and
 
29,
 
2024,
 
and
 
the
 
opening
 
of
 
a
 
docket
 
to
 
receive
 
public
 
input
 
on
 
labeling
 
of
 
wine,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
with
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutritional
 
information,
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
and/or
 
ingredients.
 
TTB
 
received
 
over
 
5,000
 
written
 
comments
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232
 
and
 
heard
 
from
 
47
 
speakers
 
during
 
the
 
listening
 
sessions.
 
TTB  is  now  publishing  for  public  comment  a  new  proposal  that  would  require  “Alcohol  Facts”  
labeling
 
for
 
wines,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
provides
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutritional
 
information,
 
per
 
serving,
 
for
 
these
 
products
 
on
 
labels.
 
TTB
 
is
 
addressing
 
the
 
Competition
 
Report's
 
recommendations
 
and
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232
 
comments
 
from
 
the
 
listening
 
sessions
 
on
 
mandatory
 
allergen
 
and
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
in
 
separate
 
rulemaking
 
projects.
 
Title  of  the  Alcohol  Beverage  Statement  
TTB  is  proposing  “Alcohol  Facts”  as  the  title  of  the  informational  statement,  instead  of  “Serving  
Facts,”
 
which
 
was
 
proposed
 
in
 
2007.
 
WineAmerica
 
does
 
not
 
support
 
this
 
change
 
as
 
it
 
would
 
create
 
confusion
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
have
 
grown
 
accustomed
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
on
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labels.
  
We
 
will
 
now
 
address
 
TTB’s
 
specific
 
questions:
 
1.  Which  title,  “Serving  Facts”  or  “Alcohol  Facts,”  would  be  more  informative  to  consumers?  
Does
 
the
 
title
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
better
 
describe
 
the
 
information
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
statement,
 
which
 
includes
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information?
 
The  title  of  “Serving  Facts”  will  be  more  informative  to  consumers.  The  consumer  is  already  
accustomed
 
to
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
disclosure
 
to
 
inform
 
how
 
much
 
alcohol
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
labeled
 
product.
 
Creating
 
an
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
disclosure
 
will
 
only
 
confuse
 
the
 
consumer.
 
2.  Would  the  use  of  the  title  “Alcohol  Facts”  affect  compliance  costs  or  regulatory  burdens  by  
requiring
 
a
 
title
 
change
 
for
 
products
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
labeled
 
with
 
a
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
statement?
 
Yes,  the  producers  who  are  already  voluntarily  disclosing  serving  facts  and  nutrition  information  
will
 
need
 
to
 
redo
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
existing
 
labels
 
at
 
significant
 
cost.
 
 
3.  Are  consumers  accustomed  to  finding  nutrient  content  information  in  a  Serving  Facts  
statement?
 
Would
 
changing
 
the
 
title
 
to
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
cause
 
confusion?
 
Yes,  as  described  above,  the  consumer  already  knows  to  look  for  the  alcohol  content  statement,  
and
 
the
 
serving
 
facts
 
should
 
remain
 
separate
 
from
 
that.
 
4.  Alternatively,  does  the  title  “Alcohol  Facts”  make  it  easier  for  consumers  to  readily  
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items?
 
That  is  unknown,  as  it  does  not  currently  exist  in  any  form.  Alcohol  consumers  already  are  able  
to
 
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items
 
through
 
the
 
Government
 
Warning
 
statement
 
and
 
alcohol
 
disclosure,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
on
 
other
 
food
 
items.
 Linear  Display,  Type  Size,  and  Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  Information  
Linear  Display  
TTB  proposes  to  allow  the  option  of  a  linear  display  placed  on  the  container  (including  a  keg),  as  
long
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
set
 
apart
 
from
 
other
 
information
 
and
 
is
 
placed
 
inside
 
a
 
box
 
with
 
the
 
title
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-faced
 
type.
 
WineAmerica  supports  the  option  of  a  linear  display  placed  on  a  container  with  the  moniker  
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-faced
 
type,
 
separate
 
and
 
apart
 
from
 
the
 
existing
 
alcohol
 
content
 
disclosure.
 
We
 
agree
 
with
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
premise
 
that
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
will
 
allow
 
information
 
to
 
fit
 
on
 
labels
 
of
 
most
 
containers
 
without
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
back
 
label,
 
while
 
requiring
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
box
 
will
 
make
 
it
 
more
 
noticeable
 
to
 
consumers.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
should
 
only
 
be
 
one
 
option
 
for
 
disclosure.
 
Type  Size  
TTB  is  proposing  that  the  minimum  type  size  requirements  for  Alcohol  Facts  statements  mirror  
existing
 
type
 
size
 
requirements
 
for
 
mandatory
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
wine,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverage
 
regulations
 
in
 
parts
 
4,
 
5,
 
and
 
7,
 
respectively.
 
 
WineAmerica  agrees  with  TTB  for  on  label  disclosure,  if  the  producer  so  chooses  to  disclose  
their
 
serving
 
facts
 
information
 
on
 
label.
 
Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  Information  
TTB  considered,  but  is  not  proposing,  to  allow  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  panel  to  be  
distributed
 
by
 
electronic
 
means
 
via
 
a
 
link,
 
code,
 
or
 
other
 
marking
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
rather
 
than
 
requiring
 
the
 
full
 
panel
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
itself.
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
allowing
 
mandatory
 
information
 
to
 
appear
 
somewhere
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
would
 
decrease
 
consumer
 
accessibility
 
to
 
information
 
that
 
informs
 
decisions
 
about
 
purchasing
 
and
 
consuming
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.
 
WineAmerica  strongly  supports  the  disclosure  of  Serving  Facts  via  electronic  means.  The  
European
 
Union
 
has
 
already
 
allowed
 
for
 
this
 
and
 
it
 
makes
 
logical
 
sense
 
for
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
to
 
follow
 
suit.
 
TTB
 
notes
 
that
 
industry
 
comments
 
in
 
the
 
2024
 
Listening
 
Sessions
 
reflected
 
this
 
by
 
outlining
 
our
 
argument
 
as
 
such:
 
1.  Web-based  disclosure  is  a  cost-efficient  means  to  provide  information  to  consumers  that  
provides
 
producers
 
with
 
flexibility
 
and
 
reduces
 
time
 
to
 
market.
 
If
 
a
 
consumer
 
wishes
 
to
 
access
 
the
 
information
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
without
 
creating
 
significant
 
financial
 
burden
 
to
 
the
 
producer.
 
2.  The  EU  has  already  implemented  this  system.  It  benefits  producers  to  not  have  to  
produce
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
label
 
for
 
the
 
products
 
sold
 
in
 
different
 
markets.
 
Additionally,
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
allows
 
for
 
easier
 
tailoring
 
of
 
specific
 
information
 
to
 
different
 
markets
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
print
 
various
 
different
 
labels.
 3.  Web-based  disclosure  is  more  consumer  friendly.  For  example,  a  QR  code  can  prevent  
labels
 
from
 
becoming
 
cluttered,
 
which
 
can
 
ultimately
 
be
 
distracting
 
for
 
the
 
consumer.
 
We  will  now  address  TTB’s  specific  questions:  
1.  Would  consumers  have  trouble  locating  Alcohol  Facts  information  if  that  information  is  
presented
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display?
 
Consumers  would  not  have  trouble  locating  Serving  Facts  information  presented  in  a  linear  
display.
 
2.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  the  linear  display  to  appear  in  a  box  with  the  title  “Alcohol  
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-face
 
type
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
better
 
locate
 
the
 
information?
 
Alternatively,
 
should
 
industry
 
members
 
be
 
allowed
 
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
surrounded
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
A  box  should  not  be  required.  The  title  should  not  be  labeled  as  “Alcohol  Facts”  but  as  “Serving  
Facts”.
 
3.  Do  consumers,  industry  members,  or  other  interested  parties  have  comments  on  the  type  size  
and
 
general
 
formatting
 
requirements
 
proposed
 
for
 
both
 
linear
 
displays
 
and
 
panels?
 
WineAmerica  supports  minimum  type  size  requirements  for  an  “on  label”  disclosure  option.  
4.  How  would  the  proposed  formatting  requirements,  including  the  linear  display  option,  affect  
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
formatting
 
requirements?
 
Any  on-label  disclosure  will  increase  costs  for  producers.  Additionally,  there  is  limited  space  on  
a
 
label.
 
This
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
clutter
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
and
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
Thus,
 
an
 
“off-label”
 
solution
 
is
 
preferred
 
to
 
reduce
 
costs
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens.
 
5.  Should  TTB  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  mandatory  statements  of  alcohol  
content
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
appear
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
For
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
should
 
TTB
 
remove
 
the
 
maximum
 
type
 
size
 
limitation
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
that
 
may
 
appear
 
elsewhere
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
well?
 
The  TTB  should  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  any  serving  facts  disclosure  
6.  What  alternatives  exist  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers?  How,  if  it  all,  
would
 
the
 
alternatives
 
affect
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
displaying
 
the
 
information
 
as
 
proposed
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
aligning
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
There  should  be  an  “off-label”  option  for  disclosing  Serving  Facts.  This  will  allow  for  less  clutter  
on
 
the
 
product
 
label
 
and
 
avoid
 
confusion
 
among
 
consumers.
 
WineAmerica
 
does
 
not
 
believe
 
it
 
will
 
impact
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace.
 
The
 
main
 
benefit
 
for
 
aligning
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
information
 
with
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries
 
will
 
allow
 
producers
 
to
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
spend
 money  and  resources  creating  various  different  labels  for  various  different  markets.  A  web  based  
solution
 
allows
 
for
 
a
 
quick
 
ability
 
to
 
change
 
any
 
requirements
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
market.
 
7.  If  TTB  adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  for  alcohol  beverages,  should  it  include  the  
option
 
of
 
satisfying
 
the
 
requirement
 
by
 
making
 
the
 
information
 
available
 
electronically,
 
for
 
example
 
by
 
including
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
to
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
view
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
the
 
product
 
label?
 
Would
 
this
 
option
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
sufficient
 
access
 
to
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
at
 
the
 
retail
 
store
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions,
 
given
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
potential
 
issues
 
regarding
 
the
 
adequacy
 
of
 
cellular
 
or
 
Wi-Fi
 
coverage
 
at
 
some
 
retail
 
stores,
 
and
 
other
 
potential
 
technological
 
challenges?
 
Would
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
disclosures
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
create
 
disproportional
 
barriers
 
to
 
access
 
for
 
particular
 
communities?
 
TTB  should  allow  for  electronic  disclosure  of  Serving  Facts  labeling.  This  would  allow  for  the  
consumers
 
that
 
wish
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
information
 
readily
 
available
 
to
 
them,
 
and
 
allow
 
for
 
producers
 
to
 
have
 
flexibility
 
to
 
disclose
 
either
 
on
 
label
 
or
 
off
 
label.
 
Off-label
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
reduces
 
the
 
regulatory
 
and
 
financial
 
burden
 
of
 
producers.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
Pew
 
Research
 
Center,
 
98%
 
of
 
Americans
 
now
 
own
 
a
 
cell
 
phone
 
of
 
some
 
kind,
 
and
 
91%
 
of
 
cell
 
phone
 
owners
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone.
 (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/)  There  are  minimal  barriers  for  consumers  to  access  Serving  Facts  information  in  2025.  The  ubiquitousness  of  the  smartphone  
and
 
the
 
internet
 
allows
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
access
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
if
 
they
 
so
 
choose.
 
8.  How  would  the  option  of  disclosing  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  information  via  electronic  
means
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
disclosure
 
via
 
electronic
 
means?
 
Disclosing  Serving  Facts  via  electronic  means  lessens  the  costs  and  regulatory  burdens  for  small  
producers,
 
who
 
comprise
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
American
 
wine
 
industry.
 
The
 
ease
 
of
 
updating
 
this
 
information
 
for
 
different
 
vintages
 
of
 
wines
 
is
 
much
 
more
 
cost
 
effective
 
for
 
producers,
 
rather
 
than
 
having
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
for
 
each
 
product
 
whenever
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
the
 
information.
 
Certain
 
other
 
benefits
 
include
 
avoiding
 
clutter
 
on
 
a
 
label,
 
which
 
in
 
turn
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
The
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
also
 
allows
 
the
 
consumers
 
who
 
wish
 
to
 
view
 
the
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
in
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
dedicated
 
location.
 
 
9.  If  TTB  were  to  allow  mandatory  information  to  be  disclosed  electronically,  should  TTB  allow  
all
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
electronically
 
or
 
should
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
If  TTB  were  to  allow  for  electronic  disclosure  of  mandatory  information,  all  of  the  Serving  Facts  
information
 
that
 
TTB
 
may
 
require
 
should
 
be
 
disclosed
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
place
 
to
 
avoid
 
confusion.
 
10.  If  TTB  allowed  multiple  options  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers,  could  the  
lack
 
of
 
uniformity
 
create
 
consumer
 
confusion?
 
We  do  not  believe  so,  as  long  as  the  electronic  disclosure  is  clearly  notated.   
 Serving  Size  Reference  Amounts  
TTB  is  proposing  that  for  wine  that  is  7%  to  16%  alcohol  by  volume  a  serving  be  considered  5  
fluid
 
ounces
 
and
 
for
 
wine
 
that
 
is
 
16%
 
to
 
24%
 
a
 
serving
 
be
 
considered
 
2.5
 
fluid
 
ounces.
 
 
WineAmerica  supports  and  agrees  with  this.  We  also  agree  with  TTB  that  serving  size  reference  
amounts
 
are
 
not
 
intended
 
as
 
recommended
 
consumption
 
amounts
 
but
 
rather
 
are
 
intended
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
reference
 
amount
 
for
 
the
 
consumer
 
to
 
determine
 
alcohol,
 
nutrient,
 
and
 
calorie
 
intake.
 
 
On  the  specific  questions:  
1.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  a  reasonably  accurate  representation  of  the  amount  of  the  
product
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
serving?
 
If
 
not,
 
what
 
data
 
or
 
other
 
information
 
should
 
TTB
 
consider
 
that
 
would
 
give
 
a
 
better
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
amount
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
product
 
category?
 
Yes,  5  fluid  ounces  is  largely  considered  to  be  a  standard  serving  size  for  table  wine,  and  aligns  
with
 
the
 
current
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines
 
for
 
Americans.
 
 
2.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  more  accurate  than  the  serving  sizes  set  forth  in  TTB  
Ruling
 
2004-1
 
(1.5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
wines,
 
and
 
12
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
regardless
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content)?
 
Why
 
or
 
why
 
not?
 
Yes,  we  believe  this  is  accurate  for  wine.  
3.  Should  TTB  allow  greater  flexibility  in  serving  sizes?  
While  many  restaurants  serve  higher  fluid  ounces  per  serving,  it  is  widely  accepted  that  5  fluid  
ounces
 
is
 
a
 
standard
 
serving
 
for
 
wine.
 
 
4.  Should  the  serving  size  reference  amounts  be  exactly  equal  to  an  alcoholic  drink  equivalent  of  
0.6
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
would
 
this
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
not
 
recognizing
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
typically
 
consumed?
 
This  would  be  confusing  and  misleading  to  consumers.  The  amounts  that  TTB  suggests  are  what  
are
 
widely
 
known
 
and
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
standard
 
serving
 
sizes
 
for
 
beverage
 
alcohol.
 
 
Dual  Column  Alcohol  Facts  Display  Panel  
WineAmerica  opposes  a  Serving  Facts  panel  on  wine  labels.  We  are  in  favor  of  a  linear  
disclosure,
 
or
 
a
 
web
 
based,
 
off-label
 
disclosure.
 
 
Implementation  Period  
WineAmerica  agrees  with  TTB’s  proposal  of  a  five-year  implementation  period  for  Serving  
Facts
 
disclosure.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
will
 
provide
 
producers
 
with
 
adequate
 
time
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
changes
 
that
 
TTB
 
will
 
eventually
 
propose.
 
A
 
five
 
year
 
implementation
 
period
 
will
 
allow
 
for
 
producers
 
of
 
all
 
sizes
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
additions
 
to
 
their
 
existing
 
labels.
 
We
 
appreciate
 
that
 
TTB
 
is
 
not
 proposing  a  new  COLA  approval  when  the  serving  facts  information  will  be  the  only  addition  to  
the
 
label.
 
It
 
is
 
our
 
hope
 
that
 
will
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
for
 
off-label
 
disclosure.
 
 
TTB  asks  if  producers  will  begin  the  necessary  changes  before  the  end  of  the  implementation  
period.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
this
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
case.
 
Additional  Comments  on  Testing  of  Products  
WineAmerica  is  in  favor  of  disclosure  of  serving  facts,  but  in  a  way  that  is  not  over  burdensome  
to
 
wine
 
producers.
 
TTB
 
outlines
 
that
 
the
 
estimated
 
cost
 
of
 
changing
 
a
 
label
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
$1600
 
per
 
label.
 
This
 
cost
 
can
 
be
 
cut
 
down
 
considerably
 
if
 
an
 
off-label
 
disclosure
 
is
 
allowed.
 
●  Wineries  should  not  have  to  test  all  of  their  products  for  disclosure  of  serving  facts.  It  has  
been
 
estimated
 
that
 
it
 
could
 
cost
 
up
 
to
 
$500
 
per
 
product
 
if
 
comprehensive
 
testing
 
is
 
required.
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
would
 
not
 
require
 
industry
 
members
 
to
 
send
 
each
 
batch
 
of
 
a
 
product
 
to
 
a
 
laboratory
 
for
 
analysis
 
prior
 
to
 
labeling
 
the
 
product;
 
nor
 
would
 
it
 
require
 
any
 
testing
 
at
 
all.
 
Industry
 
members
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
analytical
 
testing,
 
published
 
databases,
 
mathematical
 
calculations
 
based
 
on
 
alcohol
 
content
 
(for
 
certain
 
products),
 
or
 
an
 
appropriate
 
blend
 
of
 
these
 
methods
 
to
 
accurately
 
label
 
their
 
products.
 
WineAmerica
 
supports
 
this.
 
 ●  TTB  issued  public  guidance  to  broaden  the  tolerance  levels  for  calorie  statements  on  
labels
 
and
 
in
 
advertisements.
 
In
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule,
 
TTB
 
has
 
included
 
this
 
expanded
 
tolerance
 
level
 
for
 
calories,
 
and
 
is
 
adopting
 
an
 
objective
 
standard
 
for
 
the
 
three
 
nutrients
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed,
 
allowing
 
a
 
tolerance
 
of
 
20
 
percent
 
above
 
or
 
below
 
the
 
labeled
 
amount.
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
these
 
proposed
 
changes
 
will
 
facilitate
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
“typical
 
values”
 
charts
 
and
 
other
 
methodologies
 
to
 
calculate
 
the
 
calories,
 
carbohydrates,
 
fat,
 
and
 
protein
 
content
 
of
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
product.
 
TTB
 
is
 
also
 
proposing
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverage
 
labeling
 
statements.
 
This
 
means
 
bottlers
 
would
 
be
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
change
 
labels
 
due
 
to
 
minor
 
variations
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content
 
among
 
different
 
batches.
 
Wine
 
America
 
supports
 
this
 
as
 
well.
 
 
Conclusion  
WineAmerica  would  like  to  thank  TTB  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  proposed  
rulemaking:
 
Notice
 
237:
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
To
 
sum
 
up
 
our
 
main
 
points:
  ●  An  off-label/web  based  solution  should  be  allowed  for  disclosure  of  serving  facts.  ●  On-label  disclosure  should  be  in  a  linear  format.  ●  In  order  to  avoid  confusion,  the  disclosure  should  be  referred  to  as  SERVING  FACTS,  
not
 
ALCOHOL
 
FACTS.
 ●  Testing  of  each  product  should  not  be  required.  ●  We  hope  that  TTB  will  bear  in  mind  that  the  10,000+  American  wineries  are  
predominantly
 
small
 
family
 
farms
 
with
 
very
 
limited
 
resources,
 
and
 
that
 
$1600
 
per
 
label
 
and
 
$500
 
per
 
product
 
test
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
major
 
financial
 
burden.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including 
many small, family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the 
nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   W e provide the 
following comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 237: Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (NPRM 237). 
 
In general, Wine Institute supports the current “Serving Facts” framework as voluntary.  If TTB 
imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling, we respectfully request a similar framework but 
with several important recommendations and considerations that we outline below.   
 
1. Wine is Unique—it is not a Recipe Product—and Wineries Vary Greatly in Size 
 
It is important to note at the outset that wine is u nique.  Wine is not a recipe product.  Unlike 
other beverages, wine is inherently tied to its place of origin.  Every vintage is different, and 
each wine varies by year, winegrape varietal, location, climate and growing conditions.   
Because the winemaking process is dynamic and highly variable, decisions impacting 
nutritional content can be made right up to the time of blending and bottling.  This is significant 
because wine labels are most often printed many months in advance of bottling and changes 
to those labels can take up to two years to implement. 
Beyond the vineyard and winery, the wine marketplace is also distinct in terms of both the 
number of producers and unique wines available.   According to TTB, there are currently more 
than 17,500 bonded wine producers across the US  and approximately 6,300 of them are in 
California.  Like our membership, the overwhelming majority of these are small, family-owned 
Page 2 of 10  
wineries that operate in a heavily regulated industry with correspondingly high cost s in 
establishing and maintaining their businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations 
be fiscally responsible, reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only 
if legitimate public goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  In furtherance 
of those good rulemaking principles, TTB should consider whether it has sufficient information 
and stakeholder input to design and implement new labeling rules  at this time.  We note that 
NPRM 237 poses more than  80 questions and expressly solicits comments on over 45 topics 
that range from general to specific.   That leaves many  of the issues subject to change  and 
creates a challenge for stakeholders to provide sufficient information and data in the time 
provided.  G iven that NPRM 237 constitute s a “significant regulatory action”  if adopted, it is 
important that the issues are fully vetted and TTB  is fully informed before deciding whether or 
how to proceed. 
 
Cost Burden Falls Unevenly on Wine 
It is appropriate that TTB is required to design regulations, including this proposed regulation, 
in the most cost-effective , least burdensome  manner while still achieving the intended 
regulatory objective.  We applaud TTB for seeking industry input in attempting to accurately 
estimate the costs, however, we are concerned that TTB ’s cost analysis does not fully reflect 
the likely fiscal impact on the nation’s 17,000+ wineries.  
 
TTB’s analysis of the cost impact on wineries is based in large part on NielsenIQ data including 
an estimate of the number of universal product codes (UPCs) associated with wines in the US 
marketplace.  We are very concerned that focusing on UPCs  may vastly undercount the 
number of wine labels that this proposal would require to be changed.  Many wine labels do 
not include a UPC  because thousands of wineries rely on non-traditional sales channels 
including direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales and winery tasting room sales  where a UPC is not 
needed.  DTC wine sales are a unique and important feature of the wine marketplace now that 
48 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of DTC wine sales.  Wine analytics firm, 
bw166, has done research showing that Nielsen/NIQ data represents only 54 percent of all tax 
paid volume entering the US wine market in 2024.
1  
 
If TTB’s analysis does  not appropriately account for the gaps in the data it is using , then it is 
likely that its analysis grossly underestimates the potential costs for wineries.   We are 
concerned this analysis undercount s the thousands of wines that do not reach consumers 
through traditional distribution and retail channels  and thus are not accounted for in the 
Nielsen data.  Between 2018 and 2024, TTB approved an average of 113,536 COLAs for wine 
per year.  In recent years, TTB has also expanded the list of items that may be revised on wine 
labels without the need to resubmit a new COLA application.  This list now includes forty 
different pieces of information that can be changed without the need for a new COLA which 
suggests that many COLAs may be active in the marketplace for multiple years  (if not many 
years).  As a result, bw166 estimates that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 distinct wine 
products for sale in the US at any given time  and which would require a newly designed label  
 
1 https://www.bw166.com/data-science-services/  Page 3 of 10  
as a result of this proposed regulation. 2  The sheer size and diversity of the wine marketplace 
means the cost of this proposal would be significant for wineries of all sizes. 
 
We also note that as presented in NPRM 237, TTB’s cost analysis demonstrates that the cost 
burden of the proposal will fall disproportionately on wine producers.  Table 4 shows that with 
a five-year compliance period, fully 49 percent  of the total cost of the proposal would fall to 
wineries, while spirits and beer producers would face half the cost  of wineries.  Yet when TTB 
estimates the number of Total Units in the marketplace in Table 1, wine constitutes only 18  
percent of the Total Units. Wine Institute is very concerned about the impact this uneven cost 
burden will have on the t housands of small and medium sized wineries in the US.  We are 
continuing to review TTB’s cost analysis and seek input from our winery members on the 
anticipated costs of this proposal and will be sharing that information with TTB when available. 
 
2. Wineries Should be Allowed to Provide Serving Facts Information by Electronic 
Means (e.g., QR Codes) 
 
In NPRM 237, TTB explains  that it considered but is not proposing to allow the Serving Facts 
panel to be distributed by electronic means via a link, code, or other marking on the physical 
label.  Instead, TTB proposes requiring the full panel to appear on the physical label, but it also 
sought comments about its assumptions on this topic. 
 
Established Benefits of Permitting QR Codes 
Permitting the use of electronic means —such as a Quick Response ( QR) code—to present 
Serving Facts would provide many be nefits to many  stakeholders including consumers, 
producers, retailers, and regulators.  In NPRM 237, TTB recognized some of the benefits.  They 
included cost -efficiency, flexibility, reduction in time -to-market, and the ability to present 
relevant information in a more consumer -friendly format that is away from overcrowded 
physical labels.  There are other benefits, however, including: 
 
• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer  in real time, which is 
not possible using physical labels.   This is already used to comply with the E uropean 
Union’s (EU) labeling requirements for wine—which permits mandatory nutrition and 
ingredient information via QR code—given the EU’s 24 official languages. 
• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired.
3 
• Reduced waste, consistent with industry sustainability goals, since the use of e-labels 
reduces label re-prints.

making-food-more-accessible-for-the-visually-impaired (“QR codes can link to audio descriptions when scanned with 
a smartphone.  This feature can provide detailed information about the product, including ingredients, cooking 
instructions, and dietary information.”) ; see also, BBC News, The codes helping visually -impaired people shop, 
available at https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57679943. Page 4 of 10  
QR Codes in the Marketplace 
Electronic means such as QR codes are already common in the marketplace.   For instance , 
in NPRM 237, TTB cited broad implementation of digital labels  for wine  in the EU and the 
benefits electronic information disclosure could have for international trade.   We agree that 
permitting Serving Facts information by electronic means in the US will help harmonize 
approaches, minimize negative trade impacts, and facilitate US wine exports.  
 
The EU is not the only place where mandatory disclosures are permitted exclusively via 
electronic means.   For example, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) permits products 
that are subject to the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard to provide the 
mandatory bioengineered symbol via QR code rather than on the physical label.
4  Likewise, in 
2023 amendments to the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act , 
the Legislature made clear that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recover y “may 
require that a beverage container intended for sale in the state be … marked with a scan code, 
a quick response (QR) code, or a universal product code or similar machine-readable indicia” 
when providing the mandatory California Redemption Value or “CRV” mark rather than 
printing or embossing it on the container.5 
  
Notably, GS1—the international global standards organization for developing and maintaining 
barcodes—is working toward what it calls Sunrise 2027.  That is the year by which the global 
supply chain (manufacturers and retailers ) will move toward “two-dimensional barcodes ” 
(e.g., QR codes) .  According to GS1, b y the end of 2027, retailers w ill need to ensure their 
point-of-sale systems are equipped with scanners capable of reading both traditional 
barcodes and 2D barcodes.  The shift has already begun with the new technology being tested 
in 48 countries across the world.  In short, QR codes will become more ubiquitous, common 
and familiar to consumers, and accessible as manufacturers and retailers make this shift in 
the coming years. 
 
QR Code Accessibility 
As a related point, it is critical for TTB to consider the direction and pace at which technologies 
are trending along with consumer access, familiarity, and preferences.  For example, in NPRM 
237, TTB references a 2023 survey that the Pew Research Center conducted .  TTB notes the 
survey found that “79 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned 
smartphones compared to 90-98 percent of higher income groups.”  The same survey data for 
2024, however,  shows that 84 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 
reported owning smartphones.
6  That is a five percent increase over just one year.  Pew’s 2024 
survey data also shows that nine out of ten (91 percent) Americans now own a smartphone. 
 
Other information at the inter section of technology, consumer products, and public policy  
demonstrates that  QR codes and other electronic means  of conveying information are 
 
4 See 7 CFR 66.100(b)(3). 
5 See California Public Resources Code section 14561(d). 
6 See Pew Research Center, Mobile Fact Sheet, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/ internet/fact-sheet/
mobile. Page 5 of 10  
increasingly feasible, accept ed, and effective .  The Information Technology and Innovation 
Foundation issued a report in 2022 in which it found that (1) US mobile coverage is 
“ubiquitous,” (2) 4G covers “almost 100 percent of the population,” and (3) “improved fixed 
wireless and low-earth orbit satellites are emerging to fill the remaining gaps” over the coming 
years.7  According to GS1, recent survey data showed that 79 percent of consumers are more 
likely to purchase products with a scannable barcode/QR code (via smartphone) that provides 
the additional product information that they would want to see.8  That number will likely grow 
as QR codes become more common. 
 
Wine Labels Already Contain Other Mandatory Information on Limited Space 
Due to bottle sizes , wine labels are often mere inches  tall and wide .  Some label suppliers 
identify 3.5 x 4 inches as  the “common” or “traditional” size for the front label on a standard 
750 milliliter wine bottle.  Back labels are often  smaller.  In sum, there is limited space  to 
provide information.  That is important to note because physical labels are already subject to 
various federal and state laws that strictly prescribe what wine label s must include, may 
include, and may not include.  Below are non-exhaustive lists with some examples: 
 
• Wine label s must include: a government health warning; brand name; producer, 
bottler, or (if applicable) importer name and address; class or type designation; 
alcohol content statement; sulfite declaration (if present at 10 or more parts per 
million); net contents; color ingredient disclosures (if applicable);  an appellation of 
origin in certain circumstances; and, as a practical reality, a barcode.
9   
• Wine labels may include: a vintage date, winegrape variety, the term “estate bottled,” 
appellation of origin or approved American Viticultural Area, certification claims (if 
applicable), and other descriptive information that consumers desire including tasting 
and sensory notes, food pairing suggestions, recognizable trademarks, or information 
about the winery, winemaker, and winemaking process.
10 
• Wine labels may not include:  any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the 
addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading 
impression; that is  disparaging of a competitor's products; or any statement, design, 
device, or representation which is obscene or indecent; and more.
11 
 
In addition, labeling laws often dictate not only the  substance of what must or may be 
included on a label, but other details like the specific placement, font type, and font size used 
on labels.  Finally, wines set for export must comply with labeling regimes in the destination 
market.  As noted, this means US wines exported to the EU may use a QR code on the physical 
label to provide mandatory nutrition and ingredient information,  and—given there are 24

official languages across the EU—many US wineries use this solution that EU lawmakers 
provided. 
 
In sum, if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should permit the use of QR 
codes or other electronic means to disclose that information as an alternative to printing it on 
labels. 
 
3. The Title of the Proposed Panel Should Remain as “Serving Facts” 
 
The current voluntary rules for disclosing nutritional information use the title “Serving Facts”  
and have since those rules initially issued in 2013.  In NPRM 237, TTB proposes now using the 
title “Alcohol Facts” but also seeks input on whether it should continue using “Serving Facts” 
instead. 
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should continue using the title “Serving 
Facts” for several reasons.  The most obvious reason is consistency.   Again, since 2013, TTB 
has permitted the optional disclosure of the same nutritional information proposed in NPRM 
237 but under title “Serving Facts.”  That title is what consumers, producers, and retailers 
have come to know not only on labels but also websites and product fact sheets.  Changing 
that title after years of continued use will lik ely cause confusion.  Moreo ver, it is misleading 
and confusing to use the title “Alcohol Facts” when most of the information in the proposed 
panel has nothing to do with alcohol.  Instead, it presents information about serving size, 
servings per container, and respective amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein 
per serving.  Finally, “Serving Facts” is sufficiently distinct from FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” title 
and thus avoids any confusion with beverages that do not contain alcohol.  The title sho uld 
remain as “Serving Facts.” 
 
4.  An Implementation Period of Five Years is Reasonable and Necessary 
 
TTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal 
Register.  If TTB  imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling , we strongly agree with the  
proposed five-year compliance period and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing  it.  Five 
years would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new labeling 
processes which will help minimize —but not eliminate—financial and operation burdens.  It 
would allow ample time for public and stakeholder education  and regulatory guidance .  It 
would also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, and 
advertising materials and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in NPRM 237, five years is 
within the t ypical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according t o an  FDA 
regulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.

Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments,” 2016, 
available at https://www.fda.gov/media/98712/download. Page 7 of 10  
 
5. Proposed Serving Size and Servings Per Container Should be Maintained 
 
TTB proposes including a serving size of 2.5 fluid ounces for wines with above 16 to 24 percent 
Alcohol by Volume (ABV) and 5 fluid ounces for wines with 7 to 16 percent ABV.   TTB also 
proposes including the number of servings per container.  We consider the proposed serving 
sizes and a servings per container disclosure to be reasonable,  familiar to consumers , and 
consistent with what is used under the current voluntary rules and therefore appropriate to 
use if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts. 
 
6.  A Single Alcohol Content Statement Expressed as ABV is Appropriate 
 
TTB proposes including an alcohol content statement—expressed as ABV per serving—for all 
wines including for those with 7 to 16 percent ABV and, underneath, a statement of alcohol 
content in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts , it should require only one alcohol 
content statement expressed as ABV and not  require a statement in fluid ounces of pure 
alcohol per serving.  For many decades, ABV has been the near universal means for disclosing 
alcohol content for wines.  This is true in  the US and many parts of the world.  As a result, 
consumers are already familiar with and understand how to interpret ABV levels in wines.   
 
This consumer acceptance of ABV labeling is reflected not only in the US’s current labeling 
regulations but also in multiple trade agreements to which the US is a party.   The World Wine 
Trade Group Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling specifies that all parties must 
accept alcohol content labeling by volume (ABV).
13  Additionally, the US -Mexico-Canada 
Agreement (USMCA) includes a similar provision in Annex 3-C which also requires the parties 
to permit alcohol content labeling by volume. 14  In neither case do these agreements require 
or permit alcohol content labeling by other measures such as fluid ounces.  Likewise, the 
International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), in its International Standard for the Labeling 
of Wines, also includes alcohol strength expressed as a percentage of volume (ABV) as an 
item of compulsory information.
15 
 
ABV is what consumers know and understand.  A lcohol content expressed as ABV has long 
since been required for wines above 16 percent ABV and voluntarily used for most wines that 
are 7 to 16 percent ABV.  It is also used on spirits and malt beverages.   Thus, if  TTB adopts 
mandatory provision of ABV within the Serving Facts panel , that single disclosure should 
suffice and it should not also be required elsewhere on the label.   Wine Institute urges that  
TTB not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   Unlike ABV, 
consumers are  unfamiliar with alcohol statements  in the form of fluid ounces and thus it

would cause confusion.  The fact that it would be presented in addition to ABV, would only 
compound the likelihood for confusion.  The ABV statement provides all that an interested 
consumer needs to determine how much alcohol they are consuming and in a familiar and 
common form.  
  
Likewise, ABV information will provide uniform labeling of alcohol content that will assist 
taxpayers in complying with their obligations under the Internal Revenue Code and will assist 
TTB in identifying alcohol beverage products that pose compliance risks .  Those are reasons 
TTB cites for proposing alcohol content labeling.  Also requiring a statement in fluid ounces of 
pure alcohol per serving  will have no added benefit .  Instead, it will potentially cause 
confusion and burden businesses. 
As a final point, requiring a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving  could invite 
misleading and deceptive claims since it presents a number that appears lower than ABV and 
in a form that is unfamiliar to consumers (e.g., “Just 0.7 fluid ounces of alcohol!”).  TTB should 
avoid that problem by requiring only one alcohol content statement expressed as ABV .  It 
should not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. 
 
7.  TTB Should Consider Several Points Regarding Calories, Carbohydrate, Fat, 
Protein, and Sugar 
 
TTB proposes mandatory disclosure of calories  per serving, and carbohydrates, fat, and 
protein in grams per serving.  For sugar, the Serving Facts panel may express the number of 
total sugars in grams per serving.   
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, requiring the amounts of calories, 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein in the Serving Facts panel does not present serious concerns 
for our members aside from those raised elsewhere in our comments (e.g., permitting 
provision via electronic means  like a QR code ).  That said, there are at least three important 
points that TTB should consider: 
• For carbohydrates, Wine Institute has  repeatedly expressed concern s about 
inaccuracies of the “by difference” method that TTB and FDA use for calculating 
carbohydrates in wine.  The “by difference” method as described by Merrill and Watt in 
the USDA publication, Energy Value of Foods: Basis and Derivation. Agriculture 
Handbook No. 74 (Merrill & Watt, 1973) is not accurate for wine.  TTB should work with 
FDA to permit the use of the more  accurate “quantitation and summation of sugars” 
approach as an approved method for calculating total carbohydrate content in wine 
and wine-based beverages. 
• In general, fat and protein amounts in wine will almost always be zero. 
• In general, California law prohibits the addition of sugar to wine.
16 
TTB should consider those points and perhaps seek further stakeholder input before imposing 
mandatory provision of Serving Facts. 
 
16 See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, § 17010. Page 9 of 10  
 
8. The Proposed Rules for Tolerances, Typical Values, and Format and Placements 
Options Should be Maintained 
TTB proposes an objective standard,  which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or 
below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.  TTB believes these 
proposed tolerances would facilitate the use of “typical values” charts and other 
methodologies to calculate the level of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in alcohol 
beverage products.   
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with the proposed “objective 
standard” tolerance of 20 percent and the continued ability to use “typical values” to calculate 
calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  Doing so will help allev iate some of the cost, 
operational, and other burdens—including the need for repeated and expensive testing—while 
still providing adequate information.  We note, however, that most wines have very little or no 
fat or protein.  Consequently, if a winery nee ds to declare a non-zero level (e.g. less than 0.5 
grams per serving for fat and/or protein), a 20 percent tolerance level may be insufficient and 
indeed may be below the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the analytical 
method used.  We recommend that for low levels (e.g. less than one gram per serving) that an 
absolute level be used as the specified tolerance rather than a percent  of the declared value.  
This concept is already used in other markets.  As an example, in the EU for declared le vels of 
carbohydrates, protein, and fat in food that are under 10  grams/100 grams in concentration, 
the allowed tolerances are expressed in absolute terms (i.e., +/- 2 grams for carbohydrates and 
protein, and +/- 1.5 grams for fat).
17 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with its proposal to permit much 
needed flexibility in terms of format (e.g., panel or linear) and placement  (e.g., horizontal or 
vertical).  Likewise, we agree with TTB’s  proposal that if Serving Facts becomes  mandatory, it 
will not require industry members to submit new C ertificate of Label Approval applications 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion, or alteration, of a required Serving 
Facts panel or statement containing alcohol content information.  These important and flexible 
elements will help alleviate some of the cost and operational burdens on wineries and provide 
flexibility to decide what works best for their products.   We reiterate, however, that the best 
solution is to permit the provision of mandatory information via electronic means (QR codes) 
for the many reasons stated above.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237; Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To whom it may concern: 
 
As the association for the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) industry, including makers of food, 
beverage, personal care, and household products, the Consumer Brands Association champions 
the industry that makes the products you choose and the brands you trust. From household and 
personal care to food and beverage products, the consumer  packaged goods (CPG) industry 
plays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy, contributing $2.5 trillion to U.S. GDP and 
supporting 22.3 million American jobs. Consumer Brands advocates for uniform, workable, and 
durable regulatory frameworks that are informed by risk -based science, promote consumer 
choice, and build consumer trust across the sectors we represent. As such, we appreciate the 
opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol, and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB or the 
Agency) proposed rule titled, “Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.” (Proposed Rule).  
 
As TTB develops labelling standards for most wine, spirits and malt beverages, we encourage it 
to allow  for the use of digital technologies to share labelling information with consumers. 
Succinctly, we urge the agency to be flexible in how labeling information is provided, 
including recognizing the valuable role that digital disclosure tools like SmartLabel can 
provide in facilitating accurate and up -to-date information ultimately leading to greater 
transparency for consumers.   
 
Introduction 
 
SmartLabel® by Consumer Brands Association is a nimble, adaptable digital platform launched 
in 2015 by brand owners and grocery retailers to give consumers access to more detailed product 
information than could ever fit on a package. SmartLabel serves as the defacto standard for  
consumer transparency and allows brands to display state and federally mandated and voluntary 
label information . Currently 80 parent companies participate in the SmartLabel program, 
representing more than 1,000 brands and over 100,000 products across all CPG categories, the 
largest being food and beverage. SmartLabel data is maintained by the participating brands who 
can provide  up-to-date product information with the click of a button. SmartLabel can easily 
accommodate the addition of data for wine, spirits and malt beverages.  
 
Further, SmartLabel can augment  federally required nutritional, ingredient , and allergen 
information with voluntary details that go beyond the package label such as ingredient definitions 
and sourcing  information, links to allergy prevention and management resources , as well as  SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025

sustainability attributes and practices.  Much of the voluntary information in SmartLabel spans 
nutrition, product claims,  certifications, and disclosures that consumers really care about.  
Consumers interacted with the SmartLabel platform over 22 million times in calendar year 2024. 
A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands 
Association found that consumers most often view the nutrition, ingredient , and allergen 
information on the SmartLabel pages. The survey also found that one-third of consumers have 
used SmartLabel and/or scanned a QR code to access product information  and 97% of those  
have used SmartLabel more than once. Almost six in ten (59%) American adults are likely to trust 
brands that feature SmartLabel, and more than half (55%) of consumers believe that integrating 
product information with SmartLabel will improve their impression of the brand. Consequently, 
SmartLabel food labeling provides the product information consumers seek to make informed 
decisions about the CPG products they purchase. 
 
SmartLabel Standardizes the Product Data Display 
 
SmartLabel complies with GS1 data standards (sourced via the Global Data Synchronisation 
Network or GDSN) for all attributes displayed on the platform and is a single source of up-to-date 
and accurate CPG product details because the data is directly owned, managed, updated, and 
hosted by the brand owner or the brand owner’s solution provider. Further, SmartLabel utilizes a 
uniform display and structure, which facilitates the ability of consumers to quickly and easily find 
the information they are seeking.  
 
SmartLabel can play an important role in providing accurate and up-to-date product information 
about alcoholic beverages to consumers.  SmartLabel data is displayed in a consistent 5 -tab 
template for all product categories  (Food and Beverage, Household Cleaning, Personal Care, 
Over-the-Counter Medications, Dietary Supplements and Pet Food)  and includes 
all federally mandated information that would be required to appear on the label  
(except for date code labeling for infant formula, which must be provided for the 
specific packaged product). For food and beverage products, the tabs are Nutrition, 
Ingredients, Allergens, About this Product (most of the voluntary information, 
including claims, resides on this tab) and Company, Brand & Sustainability.

The product image in the header of all SmartLabel pages can be clicked to display an enlarged 
image to aid consumers in determining if the product they have in hand matches the SmartLabel 
information. 
 
SmartLabel nutrition, ingredient, and allergen details are displayed in a consistent, readable 
template that mirrors the information on the packaging  and allows for variations in product 
formulations. The product image in the SmartLabel template header can be clicked to display an 
enlarged image of the package, which can be helpful for people with vision impairment. 
 
SmartLabel presents FDA mandatory information (nutrition information, ingredients, allergens, 
statement of identity, net quantity of contents, name and place of business, percent juice 
declaration and flavor labeling where applicable) in a consistent, easy to access and easy to read 
format. The SmartLabel program uses implementation manuals working with brands to provide 
information in accordance with applicable regulations for a consistent, reliable experience for 
consumers. For instances, the implementation manual for food and beverage prescribes that “the 
Nutrition Panel must exactly mirror what appears on the physical package for single column 
displays. ‘Exactly’ refers to all elements of the FDA’s Nutrition Facts label design including relative 
font sizes, indentations, alignment, and separation bar width. The Nutrition tab is not constrained 
by package size so the Nutrition Facts Panel should follow the FDA guidelines without truncation.” 
SmartLabel could implement a template that meets Alcohol/Serving Facts labelling requirements 
if any.  
 
The SmartLabel Trademark Licensing Agreement signed by all SmartLabel participants requires 
them to adhere to the specifications in the SmartLabel Food and Beverage Implementation 
Manual for the design and content in their SmartLabel pages. The program con ducts annual 
reviews of SmartLabel pages to make certain the data is consistent between the product 
packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page. Elements that do not comply with 
programmatic and / or regulatory requirements are identified, and brands are given a reasonable 
time frame to bring their pages into compliance.   
 
SmartLabel is Accessible 
 
SmartLabel product pages can be accessed easily in several different ways including 
smartphones, tablets, and computers – and allow users to view the information in an easily legible 
format regardless of device . SmartLabel pages appear in the browser and do not require any 
software to download or install to view SmartLabel.   
 
Consumers commonly use the native camera app on a smartphone or tablet to scan the 
SmartLabel branded QR code to reach the digital product information.  SmartLabel also offers a 
free application that can be downloaded for both iPhone and android smartphones. The app 
allows users to scan UPC barcodes for products that participate in SmartLabel. SmartLabel pages 
can also be searched and accessed using the Sm artLabel product database 
(https://SmartLabel.org/product-search) without access to the actual package. 
 
Given the ubiquity of smartphones and wide availability of broadband, consumers can readily 
access SmartLabel information by scanning the SmartLabel branded QR code. USDA’s 
Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS) has found that as of 2021, most Americans (97 percent) SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 4 of 10 
 
owned a smartphone of some kind.1 In particular, the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent 
of urban adults, 84 percent of suburban adults, and 80 percent of rural adults in America own a 
smartphone2. The Pew Research Center also found that 61 percent of individuals 65 and older  
own a smartphone.  
 
Similarly, QR code interactions increased by an estimated 6,200% between 2017 and 2021, with 
91% of consumers now having used a QR code at least once, and 87.1% of survey participants 
stating that QR codes are easy to use. 3 Moreover, internet access today is not the issue it once 
was. Today, 95% of American adults have reported that they use the internet.4  
 
Further, SmartLabel pages comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by 
the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Accessibility Initiative, which partners with 
organizations around the world to provide a high degree of internet usability for people with 
disabilities by: 
• ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility 
• developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and 
authoring tools 
• developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools 
• supporting education and outreach on web accessibility 
• coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the 
web 
• promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards 
 
The SmartLabel Template 
 
The SmartLabel landing page for food and beverage products is the Nutrition Tab, which 
replicates the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) on pack, including the FDA required formatting. In-
depth interviews from the 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands Association 
and FMI, revealed consumers found the product information in SmartLabel to be very clear, easy 
to navigate and easy to read. Consumers explained the digital rendering of the NFP in SmartLabel 
is easier to read than the NFP on-pack.

Ingredients are displayed on the second tab in descending order of predominance in a stacked, 
legible format. Many of the food and beverage implementors in SmartLabel also include voluntary 
information on ingredient definitions and functions , which can be accessed by clicking on the 
arrow next to the listed ingredient . The ingredients tab also supports information on ingredient 
sourcing and growing methods, providing consumers with valuable information about the products 
they consume.

The third tab, Allergens, displays a statement identifying the nine major food allergens under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Allergens contained in the product are listed in a stacked 
format, with the option for brands to also provide additional information on the composition of the 
allergen – for example, the allergen “milk” in a product might be composed of pasteurized milk 
and cream, dried milk , and cream cheese  – and links to allergy prevention and management 
resources. 
The fourth tab – About this Product  – displays voluntary information like claims, certifications, 
health and safety  warnings and product instructions. The fifth tab – Company, Brand & 
Sustainability – displays hyperlinks to the brand’s customer suppor t and website, company

website, Dietary Guidelines for Americans and USDA My Plate. The fifth tab is also used to display 
product sustainability attributes like How2Recycle , Recycle Check, CIRT  and hyperlinks to 
corporate sustainability practices. 
SmartLabel is a viable option for manufacturers to provide product information, both mandatory 
and voluntary, that may not be as readily available or in -depth on the product packaging. Other 
types of detailed product information that are available to consumers through SmartLabel that go 
beyond what is commonly available on the product packaging  include information about, 
bioengineered food declarations, product certifications, sustainability attributes, and company or 
brand information.  
 
Additionally, SmartLabel informs consumers that a product contains a known allergen and, if 
provided by the manufacturer, can go further and advise if the product was made in a shared 
facility or even on shared equipment for hyper-sensitive consumers. 
 
SmartLabel Facilitates Data Management  
 
For CPG manufacturers, the processes for managing digital product content generally run in 
parallel with the changes made to the physical label. Manufacturers need to determine when the 
updated product and its label will be in market to identify when it would be appropriate to circulate 
the updated online retail information. This determination does not follow a specific timeline  
because it is based on the estimated turnover rate of the product that is in commerce.  
 
Manufacturers can update SmartLabel to accommodate reformulations in near real time . 
Furthermore, SmartLabel displays the  date of the  information up date in the footer of each 
SmartLabel page: 
 
 
 
 
Consumer Research Validates SmartLabel as a Digital Transparency Tool 
 
Through consumer research , SmartLabel has confirmed that consumers expect the labeling 
information in SmartLabel to be consistent with the information on the label. As noted, the program 
SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 8 of 10 
 
conducts annual reviews of SmartLabel pages to ensure the data is consistent between the 
product packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page.  
 
Consumer research conducted in 2023 by SmartLabel nationally with 1,000 respondents across 
all demographic groups found that 43% of consumers are very likely to access more product 
information online (compared to what is provided on the label).  
 
For reasons related to their family’s well-being, 80% of respondents said they would like to know 
more about products than what is usually  on the package label . When asked about shopping 
online, 80% of survey respondents said they seek more information about a product when 
shopping online than when shopping in-store. 
 
The same survey found that 84% of consumers said they believe product information directly from 
the manufacturer is most accurate. SmartLabel pages are populated directly by the brand owners. 
 
Consumers also sa id access to product information in SmartLabel is faster and easier  to read 
than the same information on the package label . The 5 -tab SmartLabel template serves as a 
standard and ensures consistency in the way product information is displayed  
 
Digital Disclosure Provides Benefits to Manufacturers and Consumers 
 
The benefits of digital labeling accrue to both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers demand 
transparency and value the detailed ingredient, nutrition and health information  in SmartLabel. 
They appreciate the consistency of the SmartLabel design, its organized layout and the ease of 
access. Moreover, providing information via off -label, electronic means benefit s consumers by 
ensuring they receive the most up -to-date, accurate, and more comprehensive information  
directly from the product manufacturers.  A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents 
conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands Association and FMI found that: 
• 58% of consumers look for SmartLabel on products  and 51% are likely to buy products 
featuring SmartLabel. 
• 60% of consumers are likely to trust brands that feature SmartLabel. 
• Accurate and up -to-date product information and detailed product information a re key 
purchase drivers. 26% of consumers are willing to pay more for products that offer 
additional information through SmartLabel.  
 
For brand owners, the primary benefit of using the electronic or digital link disclosure option is the 
ability for the industry to rapidly and efficiently update product information, therefore minimizing 
packaging costs and packaging obsolescence. Updates are influenced by numerous factors 
including reformulations, supplier driven changes, supply chain pressures, packaging inventory 
turnover as well as limited vendor resources. Electronic or digital disclosure provides flexibility for 
manufacturers to quickly address product changes as ingredient supplies are updated and 
modified. A nimble and adaptable tool allows for efficient communication and transparency, 
ultimately benefiting consumers. with minimal disruptions to both the manufacturer and 
consumers.  
With SmartLabel, brands don’t need to touch their packaging as often, since changes can be 
made to the SmartLabel page on the fly. When a change is made on the SmartLabel page, it will SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237

appear everywhere the page is hosted in real time – on the brand ecommerce pages and retail 
ecommerce sites. In other words, with SmartLabel, manufacturers only have to make a change 
once, instead of on multiple platforms. As important, the ability to make real-time corrections and 
provide real-time information can streamline and aid regulatory enforcement efforts associated 
with any new and mandatory labeling rules. 
 
GS1 Sunrise 2027 is Just Around the Corner 
 
SmartLabel is collaborating with GS1 US in prepara tion for Sunrise 2027 – the transition from 
UPC barcodes to 2D barcodes (Digital Links). With a single scan on a smartphone, a GS1 digital 
link-enabled SmartLabel QR code will allow consumers to access nutritional information, 
allergens, sustainability and sourcing data on the SmartLabel product page. That same QR code 
can be scanned at the point-of-sale (POS) checkout counter for price lookup and a variety of other 
supply chain processes related to inventory management and recall readiness. More information 
on GS1 Sunrise 2027 and 2D barcodes can be found here. A June 13, 2025 article in Packaging 
World described how brands are piloting 2D barcodes today in anticipation of Sunrise 2027.

August 15, 2025  Ms. Amy Greenberg  Director, Regulations and Rulings Division Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau 1310 G Street NW, Box 12  Washington, DC 20005   RE: Document Number: TTB-2025-0002; 90 FR 6654 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (RIN 1513-AC93) Dear Ms. Greenberg: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) notice of proposed rulemaking: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, dated January 17, 2025.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) is the national trade association representing the wholesale tier of the wine and spirits industry. Founded in 1943, WSWA represents companies in all 50 States and the District of Columbia that hold federal permits and state licenses to act as wine and/or spirits distributors and/or brokers.   As an initial matter, WSWA strongly supports TTB’s work to implement the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) labeling requirements and views them as a critical tool to inform consumers while allowing for flexibility and innovation within the industry. We applaud efforts to modernize this system to meet evolving needs and advances in technology.  Our comment is limited to two elements of the proposal. First, we comment on Section VII.B.8.C regarding the electronic display of alcohol facts information. Secondly, we comment on Section VII.B.9 regarding serving size reference amounts.  I. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information    The proposal seeks comment on whether a final rule should allow the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means. We appreciate the perspectives TTB has received in previous comments both in support and opposition to electronic disclosure and agree with those commenters who have suggested Quick Response (QR) codes provide flexibility for industry members while empowering consumers with detailed, easy to ready information on an electronic device. As the proposal notes, rapid advancements are underway in technology and consumer expectations around how information is accessed, and we believe these factors will only increase in coming years making such technologies even more mainstream.  Further, QR-based information is already in use in many global alcohol markets where it is currently demonstrating its utility. With a simple capture of the code on the phone, all relevant information can be displayed in a clear, easy to decipher format in seconds.   Specific to readability, we note that QR codes can provide consumers with larger font sizes than the 1 millimeter minimum for wine and spirits and may provide a useful mechanism for viewing alcohol facts   
     
information in an easier to read format than some labels may provide. Often the QR view fills a smartphone screen and provides significantly more text size than would be found on a physical label, especially those for 50ml and other smaller standards of fill. Such flexibility addresses the very issues raised with linear display and type size for smaller containers.   We encourage TTB to allow electronic means as a mode of compliance for any new label requirements that may be promulgated.   II. Alcohol Expressed in Fluid Ounces may Lead to Consumer Confusion  Secondly, regarding serving size reference amounts, we comment on the questions posed in section VII.B.9 of the proposal. Specifically, we respectfully suggest that the proposed reference amounts will create unnecessary consumer confusion around what constitutes a “serving”. We recognize the proposal does not intend for the reference amounts to be “recommended consumption amounts”, but we believe they could easily be interpreted as such by consumers.   Under the proposal, consumers could be led to believe that, for instance, a distilled spirits product of 16% ABV or below is intended to be consumed in a 5-ounce serving. This is not universally true as many spirit products under this threshold are intended for use in smaller servings. In this case, having the 5-ounce serving could promote confusion around “real-world” calorie and alcohol content amounts. Similarly, in the expanding world of ready-to-drink cocktails, many similar products exist on both sides of the proposed 7% ABV delineation between 12- and 5-ounce serving references. This too could lead to significant consumer confusion around what a “serving” is intended to be for two very similar products. We encourage TTB to consider alternatives to this approach.   WSWA applauds TTB for this important work around how consumers access information and urges TTB to ensure that any changes required by a final rule avoid creating unnecessary consumer confusion and allow for industry members to utilize prevalent technology to satisfy new regulatory requirements.  Thank you for your consideration of our perspective on these important matters.  Respectfully Submitted,

Re: Comments on TTB Notice No. 237, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002: Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg: 
 
I write as President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirts Alliance (“ADSA”) to provide 
the collective comments of ADSA members to TTB’s Notice No. 23 7, entitled Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (the 
“Notice”).1  ADSA is a trade association of twenty member companies with common 
interests in the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in 
the United States.  ADSA members produce over sixty percent of all the distilled spirits 
sold i n the U.S.  Previously known as the Presidents’ Forum of the Distilled Spirits 
Industry, ADSA traces its history back over 40 years.   
ADSA and its members share TTB’s commitment to ensuring that consumers have 
access to accurate and meaningful information about the products they purchase and 
consume. We recognize the importance of transparency, particularly with respect to 
alcohol conten t and allergens that may affect consumer safety. At the same time, we 
believe that any regulatory changes must be carefully calibrated to avoid confusing 
consumers, imposing unnecessary costs on producers, or disrupting established trade 
practices in the United States and abroad. 
In these comments, ADSA responds to questions posed by TTB, offering 
recommendations based on decades of industry experience, consumer research, and 
lessons learned from both domestic and foreign regulatory approaches. We emphasize 
three overarching principles: 
1. The need for flexibility in how information is disclosed, particularly through the 
use of QR codes and digital tools; 
2. The importance of avoiding unnecessary or misleading ingredient 
disclosures that do not reflect the actual composition of distilled spirits; and 
 
1 90 FR 6654 (Jan. 17, 2025).   
 
TTB-2025-0002

3. The critical role of collaborative, phased rulemaking  with adequate time for 
implementation, tailored to U.S. market conditions rather than imported wholesale 
from jurisdictions like the European Union. 
Current Labeling Rules and Consumer Understanding 
We believe that current labeling rules already provide consumers with the essential 
information they need to make informed decisions, including alcohol content by volume, 
class or type of spirit, and required health warnings. These disclosures, together wi th 
long-standing standards of identity for distilled spirits, ensure that consumers understand 
the basic characteristics of the products they are purchasing. 
That said, ADSA acknowledges that consumer groups and other stakeholders have 
expressed a desire for more information, particularly regarding serving size and potential 
allergens. We support TTB’s consideration of these issues but caution against expanding 
labeling requirements in ways that would overload labels with text, lead to consumer 
confusion, or introduce inconsistencies across product categories. A one -size-fits-all 
mandate will not achieve the goal of clarity for consumers and may instead obscure key 
information. 
Modern technology provides tools that were not available when current labeling rules 
were first established. QR codes, in particular, can bridge the gap between static on-pack 
information and consumers’ growing appetite for detailed data. By allowing produ cers to 
provide additional information digitally, QR codes prevent label clutter, enable regular 
updates without costly reprinting, and give consumers access to more robust product data 
than could reasonably fit on a label. We strongly encourage TTB to recognize QR codes 
as a central solution for future disclosures. 
A proven precedent exists in SmartLabel, a digital disclosure tool that has transformed 
how brands communicate product information. SmartLabel allows participating brands to 
display both state and federally mandated as well as voluntary label information in a clear, 
consistent, and consumer-friendly format. Currently, 80 parent companies—representing 
more than 1,000 brands and 100,000 products across all consumer -packaged goods 
categories, most prominently food and beverage—use the program. 
The data is maintained by participating brands, who can update product information 
instantly, ensuring accuracy and timeliness without costly physical label changes. This 
model enables manufacturers to present mandatory and voluntary information that may 
be too detailed to fit on traditional packaging, while still ensuring consumer access. In the 
FDA context, SmartLabel presents required disclosures —such as nutrition facts, 
ingredients, allergens, statement of identity, net quantity, name and place of busin ess, 
percent juice declarations, and flavor labeling —using a consistent and easy -to-read 
interface. 
In-depth interviews from a 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands 
Association and the Food Marketing Institute revealed that consumers found  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 3 of 6 
 
SmartLabel’s product information very clear, easy to navigate, and easy to read. The 
strong adoption by brands and positive reception by consumers show that a well -
structured digital disclosure tool enhances transparency and consumer confidence. 
By embracing QR codes and similar digital platforms for alcohol beverage labeling, the 
agency can facilitate timely, accurate, and complete disclosures without overburdening 
packaging, producers, or consumers. The SmartLabel model proves that this approach  
can work across a highly diverse marketplace, balancing regulatory needs with industry 
innovation and consumer expectations. 
Alcohol Content, Nutritional Information, and Serving Facts 
Alcohol content per serving is one of the most important pieces of information consumers 
can have. Current rules require ABV disclosures for spirits, but similar requirements do 
not apply consistently across all beverage types. As a result, consumers are left to guess 
how a serving of beer, wine, or spirits relates to U.S. Dietary Guidelines defining a 
“standard drink” as 0.6 fluid ounces (14 grams) of pure alcohol. We recommend that TTB 
standardize alcohol content disclosures across categories, requiring b oth ABV and 
alcohol content per serving to give consumers clear, comparable information. To promote 
responsible consumption, all serving sizes should be set equal to a standard drink. 
Providing for a “single serving” that differs from a standard drink woul d confuse 
consumers; if there is more than one standard drink in a container, the label should state 
the number of standard drinks. 
We encourage TTB to use “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts” as the title for the 
informational statement. Because the required disclosures will include both nutrient and 
alcohol content information, “Serving Facts” is a broader and more accurate de scriptor. 
This approach also avoids costly label updates for producers who already voluntarily use 
“Serving Facts” under current policy. 
We support allowing flexibility in format, including the linear display option, which is 
already in widespread voluntary use and easily located by consumers. For certain small 
formats—such as 50ml containers —we recommend an exemption from alcohol facts 
labeling, as space constraints make meaningful on -pack disclosure impractical. We 
further reiterate our request to permit off-pack disclosure through a website or QR code, 
ensuring consumers have access to complete and current information without 
overburdening packaging. 
Nutritional information such as calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and alcohol content 
can be useful to consumers, but TTB should not require other nutrients or elements (such 
as sodium, caffeine, sugar, cholesterol, fiber, vitamins, minerals, or fat breakdown) to be 
listed, as this may convey unintended nutritional or health value. Nor should TTB require 
inclusion of a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking. 
We also recommend that TTB allow compliance via a Statement of Average Analysis for 
products where exact alcohol content is not known at the time of label creation, such as  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 4 of 6 
 
“cask strength” whiskeys. This flexibility would preserve accuracy while recognizing 
production realities. 
In response to TTB’s question regarding the extent of current voluntary nutrition labeling, 
we note that many ADSA members already provide nutrition content information, with 
some doing so across their entire portfolios. This demonstrates that industry members 
are already responsive to consumer interest in this information without a rigid, one -size-
fits-all mandate. 
Ingredient Lists and Why They May Mislead Consumers 
We continue to believe that requiring full ingredient lists for distilled spirits would not help 
consumers make informed choices and may, in fact, mislead them. Distillation is a 
transformative process that removes nearly all traces of the raw materials us ed in 
production. For example, while wheat may be the starting material for vodka, the final 
distilled product contains no gluten proteins or other remnants of the grain. Listing “wheat” 
as an ingredient on such a product could lead consumers with celiac d isease to avoid it 
unnecessarily, or others to assume that vodka contains nutritional qualities associated 
with wheat, neither of which is true. 
TTB has previously recognized this problem, and its long-standing position—affirmed by 
the courts—is that ingredient lists for distilled spirits provide little value and may even 
misinform consumers. Standards of identity and statements of composition alre ady tell 
consumers what type of spirit they are purchasing (e.g., gin, Scotch whisky, rum), and 
these designations are widely understood. There is no evidence that ingredient lists would 
enhance consumer understanding beyond what is already provided. 
In contrast, the European Union has taken a different approach, requiring ingredient lists 
and certain nutritional information on alcoholic beverages. However, EU regulatory 
systems are harmonized across food and beverage categories and operate under 
different legal frameworks. Importing EU-style requirements into the U.S. would not align 
with our domestic labeling standards, would create significant costs for U.S. producers 
exporting overseas, and could disrupt international trade. U.S. policy should be guided by 
U.S. consumer needs and our established regulatory approach, not by wholesale 
adoption of foreign rules. 
Allergen Disclosure and Consumer Safety 
ADSA supports mandatory disclosure of allergens where science shows that allergens 
remain present in the final product and may pose a risk to consumers. We recommend 
that TTB align definitions of “major allergens” with the Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act while acknowledging that distilled spirits frequently contain no 
allergenic proteins from their raw materials. Where allergens are fully removed during 
production, no disclosure should be required.  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 5 of 6 
 
As is already the case in some jurisdictions, allergens that are clearly indicated in the 
product name—such as “hazelnut liqueur”—should not require duplicative labeling. Over-
disclosure could create confusion or cause unnecessary concern for consumers. 
Cost Implications and Small Business Impacts 
The costs of implementing new labeling mandates would be substantial. Producers would 
face expenses related to product testing, formula verification, label redesign, and legal 
compliance reviews. These costs would be particularly burdensome for small or ne w 
businesses, many of which lack the resources to conduct laboratory analysis or manage 
multiple label redesigns. 
To mitigate these burdens, ADSA strongly urges TTB to adopt a phased implementation 
period of at least five years and to avoid piecemeal rulemaking that would require multiple 
rounds of expensive changes. A single effective date for all labeling changes would help 
businesses plan and budget appropriately. We also applaud TTB for withdrawing the 
ingredient labeling rulemaking and for proposing a 5 -year implementation period in both 
the alcohol facts and major food allergens rulemakings. 
QR codes and web -based disclosures can further reduce costs by eliminating the need 
for frequent physical label changes while still providing consumers with the detailed 
information they may seek. 
The Need for Collaborative Rulemaking 
Labeling regulations are fundamental to consumer understanding, market integrity, and 
international trade. Any changes to these rules must be science -based, practical, and 
tailored to U.S. market conditions. ADSA urges TTB to continue engaging with 
stakeholders before drafting final rules, conducting thorough cost -benefit analyses, and 
considering real-world production practices. Rules that are too rigid, overly burdensome, 
or modeled on foreign systems will not serve U.S. consumers or producers effectively. 
We welcome the opportunity to participate in future dialogue, workshops, or advisory 
groups to help develop labeling rules that provide genuine value to consumers while 
preserving the competitiveness of the U.S. distilled spirits industry. 
* * * 
ADSA appreciates TTB’s leadership in evaluating these important issues and its 
willingness to engage industry stakeholders in the process. We support mandatory 
disclosure of alcohol content per serving and science -based allergen disclosures, 
provided they accurately reflect the final product. We oppose ingred ient lists for distilled 
spirits because they are scientifically inaccurate and potentially misleading. We strongly 
encourage TTB to adopt flexible, modern disclosure methods, particularly QR codes, 
which meet consumer needs without imposing undue burdens on producers or creating 
cluttered, confusing labels.  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 6 of 6 
 
Most importantly, we urge TTB to proceed collaboratively, engaging in an open and 
iterative rulemaking process that reflects U.S. realities rather than importing foreign 
approaches ill-suited to our market. ADSA and its members stand ready to work with TTB 
to ensure that future labeling rules are clear, effective, and practical for both consumers 
and producers.

New Belgium Brewing is a leading US premium adult beverage company, known for its iconic portfolio and unique approach to business. Founded in a Fort Collins, Colorado basement in 1991, New Belgium has grown into one of the most successful breweries in the country, expanding into Asheville, North Carolina in 2016, Daleville, Virginia in 2023, and acquired Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2021. New Belgium is known for producing fan-favorite brands including Voodoo Ranger IPA, Fat Tire Ale, Bell's Two Hearted IPA, Oberon Ale, an award-winning wood cellar program, and more. Over the past three decades, New Belgium's Human Powered Business model of caring for people, protecting the environment, and owning our impact has remained consistent, guiding our business practices in all that we do. This ethos continues on today and has enabled us to reach many significant milestones over the past three decades including becoming the first craft brewery to become a certified B Corp still in operation, developing the first carbon-neutral beer in Fat Tire, and much more. I. Support for the TTB Proposal to Exclude a Small Business Exception New Belgium agrees with the TTB that there should not be a permanent exemption for small businesses to comply with any new mandatory labeling requirements. In addition to the reasoning the TTB presents, New Belgium believes that the practical effects of having a small business exemption would lead to unnecessarily inequitable and anti-competitive results and potentially stifle growth and hiring. New Belgium and Bell's combined is currently the largest craft beer producer in the US by volume, yet the company only narrowly exceeds the 1,250 employee threshold to be defined as a small brewery under the SUSB definition. Based on this, New Belgium is concerned that any small business exemption would result in a majority of craft beer on store shelves excluding any new mandatory label information. It is likely that only New Belgium, and potentially a few other craft brewers, would not be required to provide this information, along with the large brewers who operate mainly outside the craft set. The anti-competitive effects of an exemption would outweigh any additional costs for small businesses to comply. Not only would exempt competitors not be required to include nutrition information such as calories per serving, but exempt competitors would be easily identifiable on the shelf as small businesses, when in fact their businesses may be only slightly smaller than those who do not meet the exemption. Such potential marketing advantages should not be dictated by regulation, particularly when costs to comply with new regulations are minimal. New Belgium was once a small business, so it understands the challenges faced by small brewers, but equity must also be considered in any mandatory labeling. There are alternatives to small business exemptions, such as alternative nutrition information calculation processes, that would be less anti-competitive. Therefore, New Belgium agrees with the TTB to not include a small business exemption to any new mandatory labeling requirements. II. The Proposed ""Single Serving Size"" Definition Is Likely to Cause Confusion The proposed serving size with a threshold at 7% alc/vol is likely to cause confusion to craft beer consumers and brewers. Craft beer spans a wide range of alcohol content, typically from 4% alc/vol up to 10% alc/vol, with the higher end of the range often being the distinguishing factor of craft beer from non-craft beer. Using New Belgium's brands as an example, 7% alc/vol. would split certain products of our brand families with multiple flavors on either side of the proposed 7% dividing line, causing different serving sizes within the family with only minimal shifts in alcohol content. With brand families generally positioned together on retail shelves, consumers would see mismatched information, creating confusion as to alcohol content and any nutrition information, and making it difficult for consumers to compare similar products. Craft beer consumers are familiar with the current disclosures of percentage of alcohol per volume, and New Belgium encourages the TTB to not introduce complicated alcohol content or serving size disclosures that would result in labels that are more confusing to craft beer consumers and brewers. III. Conclusion New Belgium agrees with TTB that the goals of the proposal would not be served by treating certain brewers as exempt from mandatory label disclosures. For the above reasons, New Belgium encourages TTB to reconsider the proposed rule on serving size thresholds to limit confusion to craft beer consumers and brewers.",med-94ye-tbxo,,Comment(s),0,,,Fort Collins,CO,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-08-15 04:00:00,0,2025-08-21 00:38:46,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"New Belgium Brewing Company, Inc. respectfully submits this comment in response to TTB proposed rule published as Notice No. 237 (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002).  <br/><br/>New Belgium Brewing is a leading US premium adult beverage company, known for its iconic portfolio and unique approach to business.

Re: Docket No. TTB–2025–0002; Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling 
of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To Whom It May Concern: 
 
On behalf of AIM we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco 
Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule to require “Alcohol Facts” statements on alcohol 
beverage labels. 
 
About AIM 
AIM is the global industry alliance for stakeholders in Automatic Identification and Data Capture 
(AIDC) technologies, including barcoding, RFID, smart packaging, and connected solutions that 
enable accurate, accessible, and interoperable data. Our members represent all industries and 
applications that depend on trusted product information from manufacturing and supply chain to 
healthcare, retail, and consumer goods. For over 50 years, AIM has advanced the adoption of open, 
international standards to improve data quality, enhance transparency, and empower informed 
decision-making. 
 
Our Position 
AIM strongly supports TTB’s goal of improving consumer access to accurate, standardized 
information on alcohol beverage labels. Transparency is central to consumer trust, and 
standardized labeling built on internationally recognized data formats and identification systems 
ensures that the information provided is not only accurate and readable but also interoperable 
across platforms, supply chains, and digital environments. 
 
We believe that: 
 
• Standardization is essential – Mandatory “Alcohol Facts” labeling should use consistent 
data structures and presentation formats so that the information can be reliably 
understood by consumers, regulators, and digital systems alike. Utilizing recognized 
standards such as ISO/IEC 15459-1:2014 (Information technology — Automatic 
identification and data capture techniques — Unique identification Unique Identifiers) 
ISO/IEC 18004:2024 (Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture 
techniques — QR Code bar code symbology specification) and ISO/IEC 30161-1:2020 (Internet of Things (IoT) — Data exchange platform for IoT services Part 1: General 
requirements and architecture) will help ensure consistency and interoperability. 
• Digital access complements physical labels – Alongside printed information, machine-
readable data carriers (such as standardized barcodes or QR Codes linked to authoritative 
product data) can provide extended content, including multilingual details, allergen alerts, 
and sustainability information. The use of GS1 General Specifications, including GS1 
DataMatrix and GS1 Digital Link standards, will ensure that the “Alcohol Facts” label can 
integrate seamlessly into domestic and international distribution, retail, and e-commerce 
systems. 
• Interoperability enables efficiency – Leveraging established AIDC standards and best 
practices can help industry meet compliance requirements while reducing costs and errors, 
particularly for companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. 
 
AIM’s Offer of Support 
As the recognized authority for AIDC standards and best practices, AIM is willing to assist TTB and 
the industry in developing the technical guidance and frameworks necessary to implement these 
requirements effectively. We can provide expertise on: 
• Selection and application of appropriate data carriers 
• Data encoding standards to ensure interoperability 
• Integration guidance of physical and digital labeling for consumer engagement and 
regulatory compliance 
 
We commend TTB for advancing this initiative and share its commitment to protecting 
consumers, fostering transparency, and supporting fair competition. We welcome the opportunity 
to participate in future discussions or technical working groups that will help ensure the 
successful rollout of standardized alcohol labeling.

Our association represents more than 1,200 cider and perry producers across the United States—from orchard-based family operations to regional brands selling across multiple states. While our members vary in size and structure, they are unified by their commitment to transparency, craftsmanship, and agricultural tradition. We support the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's (TTB) goal of modernizing beverage alcohol labeling to ensure consumers have clear, consistent access to information about what they're drinking. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to consider the operational impact of these changes on small and agricultural-based producers—particularly those in the cider sector. Nutritional Labeling Requirements The proposed nutritional labeling requirement presents one of the most significant challenges for small cideries—many of which are closely tied to local agriculture and farm-based production. Cider makers often rely on fruit grown on their own farms or purchased from nearby orchards, supporting agricultural diversity and rural economies. Many producers do not have access to in-house laboratories and would be required to send each product—or in many cases, each vintage or seasonal batch—out for expensive third-party testing. This would be cost prohibitive for many and could discourage the use of varied, seasonal fruit that reflects annual harvest conditions. We strongly encourage the TTB to adopt a tiered approach to nutritional labeling, including: - Exemptions or simplified compliance pathways for producers under a defined annual production threshold, similar to the FDA's model for small food manufacturers. - The option to provide average or representative nutritional values rather than batch-specific data. - Permission to disclose nutritional information digitally via QR code — a system that is already accepted under the European Union's labeling requirements. This approach would promote international regulatory alignment, minimize packaging changes, and allow consumers ready access to accurate product information without imposing undue cost or operational burdens on producers. For limited-release, non-packaged, or taproom-only products, QR codes would allow minimal testing requirements while still meeting transparency goals. Without such accommodations, the cost and logistical burden of compliance could significantly affect the smallest and most innovative segments of the cider industry—many of which are rooted in agriculture and depend on flexibility to highlight the diversity of fruit from year to year. Label Flexibility for Small-Batch and Direct-to-Consumer Products Innovation is a hallmark of the craft cider movement. Many of our members release limited-edition blends, experimental fermentations, or single-varietal ciders in small volumes—sometimes only a few kegs or cases. These products are often sold directly to consumers and are not distributed through traditional retail channels. For these types of products, we ask the TTB to allow more flexible labeling options, including: - Universal batch-level nutritional and allergen disclosures available on-premise or online. - Expanded use of QR codes to communicate required information without relabeling every SKU. Implementation Timeline and Industry Support Should these proposed labeling changes be adopted, it is critical that cideries—especially those with limited staffing and infrastructure—are given sufficient time and support to comply. We support the phased rollout of the final rule, with five years of lead time for producers to comply. In addition, we recommend the development of technical guidance materials, including sample label formats and FAQs. These resources would help ensure that the final rule is not only effective, but also achievable. Conclusion We support the TTB's goal of creating a more transparent and consumer-friendly labeling system across all alcohol categories. At the same time, we believe it is essential to preserve the diversity and accessibility of our industry, which includes many small, regional, and agricultural producers who will be disproportionately affected by these changes. With thoughtful modifications, this rule can accomplish both goals—empowering consumers and supporting the sustainability of small producers. We appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective and look forward to working with the TTB as this rulemaking process continues.

Dear Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Eilers:   
  
The National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) greatly appreciates the opportunity to 
provide comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on Alcohol Facts Labeling.1  
In the past, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has referred to this 
information as “Serving Facts.”   
  
The topic here is more longstanding than simply the Treasury Report on Competition2 cited by 
TTB.  For the past 20 years, TTB has considered the Serving Facts rulemaking and issued an 
administrative ruling on this topic, along with proposed rulemaking, and nutritional labeling 
guidance.  TTB has a continuing experience with this labeling topic.  And as noted during the 
listening sessions, several public advocacy groups have filed Federal litigation to seek action 
 
1 Prior to the publication of this notice, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) held two virtual 
“Listening1 Sessions” on these topics in February 2024, and NABI presented a statement and submitted a written 
comment at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/TTB-2024-0002-0416   
2 This report resulted from President Biden’s Executive Order 14036, Promoting Competition in the American 
Economy, dated July 9, 2021 at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/14/2021-15069/promoting-
competition-in-the-american-economy  On August 13, 2025, the President issued an Executive Order that revoked 
Executive Order 14036 at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/revocation-of-executive-order-
on-competition/    The Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission applauded this action as “protecting everyday 
Americans from anticompetitive practices through tailored action, promoting economic growth, and ensuring that 
American workers benefit from competition for their labor.” at https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-

here and that litigation is stayed (and not dismissed) during the pendency of this current 
rulemaking.    
 
TTB has dealt with rulemaking and administrative rulings on these issues during the George W. 
Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joseph Biden Administrations.  Typically, the 
regulatory climate of Washington, DC changes with each new Administration. The current 
Administration has issued several executive orders on the promulgation of new regulations and 
review of existing regulations to ensure “regulations [are] squarely authorized by constitutional 
Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome 
administrative state.”3  Additionally, the trend of recent United States Supreme Court judicial 
decisions on review of regulations has changed where agencies now face a higher burden to 
show that the regulation is authorized by the underlying statute.4   
 
The proposed regulations were published for public comment before the current Administration 
took office.  NABI believes they will face a higher bar of review and clearance by 
Administration officials and by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in particular. 
Accordingly, NABI’s comments recognize the regulatory climate of the current Administration 
and the higher bar facing TTB in a judicial review of its regulations.       
 
NABI respectfully recommends that the alcohol facts statements regulation remain as a voluntary 
statement that may appear on a label or is accessible to consumers by a Quick Response (QR) 
code.

TTB has dealt with the “Servings Fact”-type label disclosure regulatory considerations through 
proposed regulations and a TTB Ruling.  The proposed Alcohol Facts Statement labeling 
regulations require the same elements of information as the voluntary Serving Facts label:

The current requirements for the voluntary use of the Serving Facts label were issued in TTB 
Ruling 2013-2, May 28, 2013, V oluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and 
Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.5   
 
The current proposed rulemaking seeks comments on whether the Alcohol Facts Statement label 
should be mandatory information on a label affixed to the container or continue to be voluntary.  
The proposal also seeks comments on multiple options about the presentation of the label. In this 
regard, NABI is only commenting on the use of the electronic alternative to communicate the 
voluntary information to consumers.   
 
Mandatory or Voluntary 
 
Under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,6 TTB is authorized to issue labeling regulations 
that, among other things, will provide “adequate information as to the identify and quality of the 
products.”  TTB has broad discretion in issuing regulations under this standard.7  While the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is required to issue such food labeling requirements on the 
nutrient statement under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, TTB is not covered 
by that law.  Accordingly, TTB’s decision to issue the Alcohol Facts/Serving Fact requirement is 
discretionary.   
 
A review of the Supplementary Information on comments submitted previously to TTB opposing 
the Serving Facts label requirement shows that the singular opposition raised is the potential 
costs associated with a mandatory requirement.  In particular, the burden of these product testing 
costs on small and medium size importers and producers was noted.8  
 
NABI agrees that this information may be valuable to many consumers and believes that many 
industry members will include it voluntarily on a label or in a QR code reference.  TTB lists a 
number of steps it has taken to mitigate these costs, such as increased tolerance ranges, use of 
typicity charts, and the five-year transition period.   A pivotal concern is whether making this 
requirement mandatory will attract or raise concerns in the regulatory approval process which 
would not arise were the requirement remains voluntary.

In a survey of NABI members, many of the following reasons were cited for keeping the Alcohol 
Fact Statement voluntary.  
 
• The voluntary option has worked.  Industry members can present this information if they 
believe that their consumers want it. 
• Congress did not enact a specific legal requirement for the Alcohol Facts/Serving Facts label 
for beverage alcohol unlike other beverages.   
• The information must be understandable to the consumer.  For example, does the average 
consumer know what a serving size is?  It is not explained on the label and the consumer 
would have to look at a chart in the regulations in order to determine it.  Similarly, do 
consumers understand that the disclosures of quantities are subject to a tolerance of plus or 
minus 20 percent? 
• Have the petitioners established and do the past comments show that consumers want all of 
this information?   
• Compliance costs are passed along to consumers in higher prices.  
• The necessary testing is expensive and is recurring.  While TTB cites ways to mitigate the 
costs, do those undercut the value of the information for the consumer?  Broader tolerances 
and typicity charts provide less accurate and more general information to consumers.  
• Logistical challenges of the global market in these products arise where labeled product 
enter U.S. to be shipped to another country’s market where that country does not allow the 
information presented in the same manner as does the U.S.    
• From a cost perspective, a five-year implementation date still poses economic challenges to 
new entrants near the effective date or those who enter the business after the effective date.   
• Quick Response (QR) codes are a good option but still have costs to update and maintain.   
• V oluntary option is consistent with the Administration’s executive directives that regulations 
must not be burdensome and must be based on clear statutory authorization.   
• Importers are currently under economic stress due to the tariffs and this labeling requirement 
is an additional expense to mandate now.   
 
These reasons support maintaining the Alcohol Fact/Serving Facts.as voluntary information.   
 
 
Quick Response (QR) Codes for Voluntary Alcohol Facts Statements are Valuable if 
Properly Regulated 
  
Quick Response (QR) codes are valuable for conveying large amounts of information about a 
product without cluttering a front, neck, and back label given the limited physical “real estate” 
on a bottle or other consumer container.    
  
NABI supports the use of a QR code.  The quality and quantity of additional information that 
may be given to a consumer via the QR code is enormous and, moreover, the QR code allows 
this additional information to be updated constantly at a cost to the industry that is far less than a 
paper label.  The QR code gives the industry member the opportunity to include some 
explanation about the element of information that would not otherwise be available on the 
limited ""real estate"" of labels on the bottle or container.  Moreover, broad generational 5 
 
acceptance of e-devices and I-phones necessitate their use today. Consumers today look for the 
QR code on a label as an information resource.     
  
There is certain information about the wine, distilled spirits, and beer/malt beverages that must 
be available to all consumers and appear on a label on the bottle or consumer container.  The 
brand name, class and type of wine or distilled spirit or category of beer, name of the producer 
and/or bottler, and alcohol content are the elements of information that fall within this category.  
The alcohol by volume (ABV) content should appear on the label while the additional details 
provided in the alcohol facts statement could be accessed through the QR code.     
  
Finally, as a practical matter, for a country like the United States that has a pre-approval review 
of labels, how does TTB envision the label specialist reviewing the QR code information?  The 
information on the QR code site would need to comply with the TTB advertising regulations.9  
Would the importer have to submit a transcript or copy of all of the information behind the QR 
code?  Given the importer must obtain the certificate of label approval (COLA) and it is possible 
that the foreign producer will operate the QR code site, the importer will need to monitor the QR 
code sites that appear on the label.  Whatever approach is adopted by TTB, it must be reasonably 
administrable in order to protect the consumer.     
  
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or requests for clarification.  NABI greatly 
appreciates your time on this important public policy decision.  
  
Sincerely,

Subject: Comments on: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages  
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance , a strategic collaboration  among 
companies and with institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable development of Mezcal. Its 
purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint 
projects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  
solutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines 
Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT 
Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in 
accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical 
regulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial 
proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods 
 
Key points of the proposal: 
• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol 
content per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number 
of servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of 
alcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   
• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal 
Register is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
General comments on the proposal:  
 
Alcohol content 
It is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to 
inform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by 
the average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, 
and that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without 
requiring placement in a specific panel or format. 
 
Serving and servings per container: 
The proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container 
across all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. 
While it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in 
a standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If 
mandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), 
which would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or 
commercial burdens. 
 
Nutritional information 
 
The proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and 
proteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may 
confuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol 
 
should not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into 
viewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions 
based on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol 
consumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. 
 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? 
Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it 
unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food 
labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful 
information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by 
implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily 
nutrient requirements? 
 
We believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any 
benefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is 
to prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could 
create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among 
consumers. 
 
We consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, 
sugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier 
than other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could 
confuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium 
content, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the 
consumer's diet and are not comparable. 
 
By its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental 
information on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that 
alcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision 
and favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of 
alcohol that each product contains. 
 
Making this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which 
goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  
trade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this 
information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible 
to consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
• Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Easy updating as regulations change. 
• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of 
harmful alcohol consumption. 
• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement 
these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in 
the U.S. 
 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
 
As previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels 
could lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious 
confusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) 
shows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is 
clear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion 
or misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. 
 
 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
 
As previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers 
to believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements 
like dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not 
recommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such 
declarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. 
 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
 
Including nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly 
believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like 
dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such 
information should not be required in any form.  
 
In Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits 
or therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus 
solely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness 
benefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising 
with alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising 
Regulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. 
These declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health 
messaging. 
 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health 
benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations 
on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
 
 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
 
 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity 
and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts 
labeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with 
such revisions? 
 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" 
panel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and 
regulatory burdens. 
 
 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
  
Making a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, 
this proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be 
more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -
fulfilment would create”. 
 
8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in 
particular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially 
small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging 
and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. 
This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
 
To reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is 
recommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements 
internationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Detailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health 
benefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid 
regulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers.

TTB Proposal on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. 
Key points of the proposal: 
 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: 
1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). 
2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. 
3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 
4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal 
establishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary 
depending on their alcohol content. For example: 
i. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) 
ii. Wines: 
1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. 
2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. 
iii. Distilled spirits: 
1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; 
2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; 
3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid 
ounces (44 ml) 
4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. 
 
 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
Compliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register 
is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
Comments on the proposal: 
 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but 
question the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not 
considered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-
006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the 
declaration of the product's alcohol content. 
 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of 
alcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested 
that this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, 
digital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. 
 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as 
if these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius 
guidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and 
that nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do 
the differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  
misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s 
labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the 
listed nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? 
Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol 
beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? 
Our position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely 
benefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage 
labeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels 
could easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which 
would only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting 
nutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that 
alcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing 
decisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. 
Furthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are 
fundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic 
beverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol 
itself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as 
somehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current 
labeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are 
distinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, 
which goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT 
Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers 
to international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly 
recommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This 
makes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
 Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
 Easy updating as regulations change. 
 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks 
of harmful alcohol consumption. 
 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to 
implement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for 
distribution in the U.S. 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
It is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and 
trans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the 
misconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
The inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be 
misle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could 
confuse consumers. 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create 
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
It is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could 
create a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true 
and could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or 
rehabilitation benefits. 
The General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be 
limited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them 
as something that improves health or well-being. 
Furthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages 
from being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from 
promoting harmful eating habits. 
The Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition 
by establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, 
rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or 
health benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such 
declarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the 
identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol 
Facts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated 
with such revisions? 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate 
unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
This measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and 
distributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would 
go against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical 
regulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives 
justified by member states. 
According to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly 
necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures 
would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased 
costs associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new 
shipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, 
new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, 
especially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  
analyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply 
chains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
It is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade 
in alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to 
consider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the 
use of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical 
labels, while reducing operational costs. 
Conclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol 
is sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided 
electronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant 
costs, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic 
beverages in general.

comments of the Mexican alcoholic beverages industry regarding the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend 
the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages, notified
(G/TBT/N/USA/2182) to the WTO TBT Committee in accordance with Article 2.9.2 
of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement).
While Mexico recognizes the objective of providing consumers with clear and 
comprehensive information, our industry expresses serious concerns that the 
proposed mandatory “Alcohol Facts” panel—particularly the inclusion of detailed 
nutritional information—could mislead consumers by suggesting that alcoholic 
beverages provide nutritional or health benefits. This approach contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines, Mexican legislation (General Health Law, Articles 
307 and 308, and its Advertising Regulation), and may distract from the core 
health objective of preventing harmful alcohol consumption.
Furthermore, the requirement to declare alcohol content in both % ABV and fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is unnecessarily complex and not easily 
understood by the average consumer. Similarly, the proposed mandatory 
declaration of serving size and servings per container would impose 
disproportionate regulatory and commercial burdens, particularly on small 
producers and exporters.
The Government of Mexico therefore strongly recommends that:
1. Nutritional information be provided on a voluntary basis or through
electronic labeling (QR codes, websites, or digital platforms), ensuring
access to relevant information without creating unnecessary barriers to
trade, in line with Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.2. Alcohol content be declared exclusively in % ABV, allowing its placement
anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible.
3. Implementation be gradual, with a minimum transition period of five (5)
years, to allow producers—particularly SMEs—to adapt their supply chains.
Mexico reiterates that the creation of labeling requirements that may mislead
consumers or impose excessive costs on producers could constitute an
unnecessary obstacle to international trade and have a disproportionate impact
on small and emerging businesses in the alcoholic beverages sector.
We thank you in advance for your kind attention to these comments and
respectfully request that they be duly considered in the elaboration of the final

It is only fair that alcoholic beverages like every other beverage and food item on the market contain per-serving information about calories, nutrients, and, when necessary, alcohol content. The reasons why I believe this proposed rule should go into effect are the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcoholic consumption, and the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are drinking. Firstly, this proposed rule is beneficial because of the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages like everything else we consume contain calories and if too many calories are consumed every day it can lead to weight gain, which we already have too much of in this country as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""on a given day, consumers of alcoholic beverages obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from alcoholic beverages"" (Nielsen et al, 2012). Assuming the consumers follow the recommendation of 2,000 calories a day that would equal 320 calories from alcoholic beverages every day. Without the proper labeling, consumers cannot know exactly how many calories they are consuming, making it extremely difficult to follow the recommended daily caloric intake if they are trying to follow it. Secondly, this proposed rule should go into effect because the United States is known to be an obese country with around 40% of adults being obese (Emmerich et al, 2024), as well as some research showing increases in obesity and heavy alcohol consumption in adults in the United States. Between 2017-2020 the combination of heavy alcohol consumption and obesity was 3.1% of adults in the United States which is up from 1.8% in 1999-2000, and it has increased 72% over time (Raza et al, 2023). That shows that not only is obesity and heavy alcohol consumption linked, but it is also on the rise. It very well could be on the rise because of the lack of consistent labeling on alcoholic beverages that do not always include the caloric value which can lead to an overconsumption of calories which in turn can cause obesity. Finally, this proposed rule should go into effect because of the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are consuming. When there is no consistent labeling among alcoholic beverages it can lead to confusion or if there is a lack of any labeling it can lead consumers to be uninformed about what they are consuming. A study of college students showed that 65% were unaware of the caloric content of the alcoholic beverages they consumed (Lloyd-Richardson et al, 2008). 65% of college students not knowing the caloric content of their alcoholic beverages is astronomically too high and this proposed rule could help lower that number by a large margin. Also, another study suggests that alcohol labeling can be effective in increasing consumers' knowledge and understanding of the health risks involved in drinking alcoholic beverages (Edmunds et al, 2023). Just knowing the risks will not stop people from consuming alcoholic beverages, but it will allow them to make informed decisions moving forward, which could allow consumers to live healthier lives. Being informed about what is consumed is extremely important and is already in place for every other consumable good so it only makes sense to hold alcoholic beverages to the same standards. In conclusion, the caloric content of alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcohol consumption, and the benefit of increased information on alcoholic beverages are all reasons why I believe this proposed rule should become regulation under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

It is only fair that alcoholic beverages like every other beverage and food item on the market contain per-serving information about calories, nutrients, and, when necessary, alcohol content. The reasons why I believe this proposed rule should go into effect are the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcoholic consumption, and the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are drinking. Firstly, this proposed rule is beneficial because of the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages like everything else we consume contain calories and if too many calories are consumed every day it can lead to weight gain, which we already have too much of in this country as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ldquo;on a given day, consumers of alcoholic beverages obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from alcoholic beverages&rdquo; (Nielsen et al, 2012). Assuming the consumers follow the recommendation of 2,000 calories a day that would equal 320 calories from alcoholic beverages every day. Without the proper labeling, consumers cannot know exactly how many calories they are consuming, making it extremely difficult to follow the recommended daily caloric intake if they are trying to follow it. Secondly, this proposed rule should go into effect because the United States is known to be an obese country with around 40% of adults being obese (Emmerich et al, 2024), as well as some research showing increases in obesity and heavy alcohol consumption in adults in the United States. Between 2017-2020 the combination of heavy alcohol consumption and obesity was 3.1% of adults in the United States which is up from 1.8% in 1999-2000, and it has increased 72% over time (Raza et al, 2023). That shows that not only is obesity and heavy alcohol consumption linked, but it is also on the rise. It very well could be on the rise because of the lack of consistent labeling on alcoholic beverages that do not always include the caloric value which can lead to an overconsumption of calories which in turn can cause obesity. Finally, this proposed rule should go into effect because of the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are consuming. When there is no consistent labeling among alcoholic beverages it can lead to confusion or if there is a lack of any labeling it can lead consumers to be uninformed about what they are consuming. A study of college students showed that 65% were unaware of the caloric content of the alcoholic beverages they consumed (Lloyd-Richardson et al, 2008). 65% of college students not knowing the caloric content of their alcoholic beverages is astronomically too high and this proposed rule could help lower that number by a large margin. Also, another study suggests that alcohol labeling can be effective in increasing consumers&#39; knowledge and understanding of the health risks involved in drinking alcoholic beverages (Edmunds et al, 2023). Just knowing the risks will not stop people from consuming alcoholic beverages, but it will allow them to make informed decisions moving forward, which could allow consumers to live healthier lives. Being informed about what is consumed is extremely important and is already in place for every other consumable good so it only makes sense to hold alcoholic beverages to the same standards. In conclusion, the caloric content of alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcohol consumption, and the benefit of increased information on alcoholic beverages are all reasons why I believe this proposed rule should become regulation under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.<br/>References: Edmunds, C.

But for major producers of beer, wine, spirits, and ready-to-drink cocktails, there's no excuse. Consumers deserve transparency. Let's be clear: alcohol is not a health product. It's a known carcinogen and a contributing factor in over 200 diseases and injuries—including heart and liver disease, multiple cancers, road accidents, suicides, and interpersonal violence.

Disclosing these substances on alcoholic beverage labels is important for several reasons: ⸻ 1. Consumer Health and Safety • Allergic Reactions and Sensitivities: Some individuals may be allergic or sensitive to PG or PEG. Reactions can range from mild skin irritation to more serious effects in susceptible individuals. • Cumulative Exposure: PG and PEG are found in many products (e.g., foods, cosmetics, medications), so clear labeling helps consumers manage their total exposure, especially for those with health concerns. ⸻ 2. Transparency and Informed Choice • Right to Know: Consumers increasingly demand transparency about what they're ingesting. Disclosing ingredients empowers people to make informed decisions aligned with their health preferences or dietary restrictions. • Ethical Consumption: Some consumers avoid synthetic additives, preferring natural or organic products. Labeling supports ethical and lifestyle choices. ⸻ 3. Regulatory Consistency • Alignment with Food Labeling Laws: Most food products are required to disclose all ingredients. Alcoholic beverages are often exempt or under different regulations, leading to inconsistencies in consumer protections. • International Standards: Many countries or regions have stricter labeling laws. Clear disclosure ensures compliance with global standards and eases international trade. ⸻ 4. Potential Toxicity Concerns • High Doses and Chronic Exposure: While generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in low amounts, high levels of PG, in particular, have been linked to toxicity (e.g., central nervous system depression, metabolic issues) in rare cases. • Vulnerable Populations: Certain groups, such as children, pregnant individuals, or those with kidney or liver issues, may be more susceptible to effects from these compounds. ⸻ 5. Environmental and Ethical Concerns • Source of Ingredients: PEG and PG can be derived from petroleum-based sources. Environmentally conscious consumers may want to avoid products made from non-renewable or industrial chemicals. ⸻ In summary, disclosing PG and PEG on alcoholic beverage labels respects consumer autonomy, promotes public health, and aligns with modern standards of transparency and accountability in food and beverage industries. https://www.contemporaryclinic.com/view/and-the-allergen-winner-is-propylene-glycol https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9431890/",m9r-clxa-9xq7,,Comment(s),0,,,Tucson,AZ,,United States,,India,Hesse,,,,,2025-04-21 04:00:00,0,2025-06-24 22:03:35,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"Propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are chemical compounds used in various food and pharmaceutical products, including some alcoholic beverages, primarily as stabilizers, solvents, or carriers for flavorings.

Key Concerns for Small Wineries Increased Compliance Costs – Small wineries may need to conduct lab testing for calorie, carbohydrate, and nutrient content, adding expenses that larger producers can more easily absorb. Independent lab testing can be costly, and ongoing compliance monitoring would add to operational burdens. Standardization Challenges – Wine is a natural product with variations between vintages, grape varieties, and production methods. Unlike mass-produced beverages, small wineries may struggle to ensure that nutrition and alcohol content remain within consistent parameters across different bottlings, potentially leading to frequent label updates and additional regulatory filings. Labeling & Packaging Costs – Updating labels to include an ""Alcohol Facts"" panel requires reformatting existing designs, which could be costly, especially for wineries producing small-batch wines. Additional label printing and regulatory approval processes could strain resources. Serving Size Ambiguities – The rule aims to establish ""appropriate serving sizes,"" but wine is consumed differently than beer or spirits. If TTB mandates a standard serving size that differs from industry norms, it could create confusion for both consumers and wineries. Competitive Disadvantages – Large producers have the infrastructure to comply with these requirements efficiently, while small wineries may struggle with additional administrative and financial burdens, making it harder to compete. Proposed Alternative Instead of a mandatory ""Alcohol Facts"" panel, TTB could allow small wineries to use a voluntary disclosure statement or a generic disclaimer that informs consumers while reducing the burden on producers. Voluntary Statement Option: Small wineries that can easily conduct testing could include a full ""Alcohol Facts"" statement, while those unable to conduct testing could opt out. Generic Disclaimer Option: Wineries could include a standardized disclaimer such as: ""Wine is a naturally fermented product, and nutritional values may vary by vintage.

Comment for Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages 
Dear Director, 
As the CEO of a major import and distributing company, working with hundreds of small wine 
producers on every continent around the globe, we respectfully submit our opposition to the proposed 
Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
Since the beginning of wine making (probably dating back 7000 years), wine has been made in very 
much the same way. It is important to note that most wine is 85% biologically pure water, taken up 
through the roots and delivered to the grapes on the vine. The remaining 15% is made up essentially of 
alcohol, plus minute quantities of organic acids, sugars, minerals and tannins. 
To analyze the minute quantities that might be considered nutritional in the wine would be a huge 
burden for the many small producers we represent. Each producer makes many different wines, some in 
very small quantities; a separate analysis would have to be done for each individual wine, leading to a 
prohibitive burden in terms of both time and cost. This is time and money that most wineries simply do 
not have. Additionally, the American consumer would not realty benefit from the nutritional information 
— if any— which would result from such analyses and labeling. 
In conclusion: We already have so many regulations regarding labeling; adding this will just burden the 
industry further, without really enlightening the American consumer. 
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share our thoughts. We hope you will give serious 
consideration to our objections. 
Sincerely, 
Mordy Herzog, CEO 
Royal Wine Corporation

Alcohol facts statements in labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages

          I am not a heavy alcoholic drinker.  Occasionally, I will drink liquor or a wine cooler but, I have never read or noticed any caloric information about the alcoholic beverage.  Even if there was harmful information about the beverage being cancerous or increasing heart rate, I never noticed a label. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths per year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths were among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need to intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and treatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-building and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve monitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve capacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). 
     An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing additional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled spirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling was not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 report on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is Notice No. 237.  The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes calorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to know about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, religious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement of alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required to have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB published Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were February 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on labeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions was 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening sessions. Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, the original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025. 

Background

     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by the TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not finalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which means there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory calorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.  Plus, the “Serving Facts” would include the number of servings per container and serving size. 

     Since TTB did not finalize the rulemaking, on May 28, 2013, TTB published TTB Ruling 2013-2, Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. In this ruling, “Serving Facts” statement could be on a voluntary basis.  As a result, in the fall of 2017, TTB withdrew the “Serving Facts” rulemaking from the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Four years later, several consumer groups and public health advocates urged TTB to finalize the “Serving Facts” rulemaking in the “2021 CSPI letter”.  In other words, these consumer groups and public health advocates demanded a response. These consumer groups included the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Alcohol Justice, the American Institute for Cancer Research, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, the Consumer Federation of America, the National Consumers League, and the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.  Overall, the TTB is making progress and taking the necessary approaches in having appropriate information to be labeled for alcoholic beverages. 

Call to Action 

  Thirty percent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States is due to overconsumption of alcohol (Goldstein, 2024). Not only are there traffic crash fatalities, but there are numerous health problems that are linked to the overconsumption of alcohol.   Therefore, having alcohol labels can be a life-or-death matter. I support the proposal for alcohol content and nutritional information to be labeled on alcohol, but also include health warning labels.  I stand for “Alcohol has Ingredients Too”.

Thank you for sharing this important information! I agree that this proposed rule is overdue. It's surprising how little transparency there is in alcohol labeling, especially given the health risks. Like you, I often overlook the labels because there's not much useful info. Adding details like calorie counts and nutrient info could really help people make better choices, especially those trying to watch their intake.

In short, the second tier of beverages containing more than 7% alcohol by volume (ABV) and up to 16% ABV, which currently assigned a serving size of 5 fl oz in the proposal, should have a serving size of 12 oz because this reflects the way in which such beverages are typically consumed, i.e., in 12 fl oz bottles or cans. As TTB's proposal stands, only malt beverages containing 7% or less ABV are assigned a serving size of 12 fl oz. This prevents apples-to-apples comparison of such products at retail, obscuring alcohol content on a by-the-bottle (or can) basis, which is how people generally consume such beverages. According to beeradvocate.com, a beer connoisseur and review website with tens of thousands of users and in operation since 1996, of the top ten ""Most Popular Beers,"" eight have over 7% ABV.

Though beeradvocate.com focuses on craft beers which often have higher ABV than is typical for beer and which may not reflect the most mainstream alcohol consumption habits, craft breer still accounts for a large amount of alcohol consumption. According to the Brewers Association, in 2024, craft brewers produced 23.1 million barrels of beer which accounted for 13.3% of the overall U.S. beer market. https://www.brewersassociation.org/association-news/brewers-association-reports-2024-u-s-craft-brewing-industry-figures/. Within the category of malt beverages of greater than 7% to 16% ABV that TTB proposes, craft beers undoubtedly dominate the market. Beers of 7+% to 16% ABV are not generally consumed in serving sizes any different than beers with 7% or less ABV. Both are predominately packaged in and consumed directly from 12 fl oz bottles or cans. TTB's proposal to establish a serving size of 5 fl oz for such beverages will only serve to confuse consumers because the consumption habits for beers in both categories are the same: drink to completion. 12 fl oz bottles and cans are not resealable and sharing of such portions is not common. Because of the similar consumption habits, two 12 fl oz cans sitting side-by-side in a retail store should contain immediately comparable information, regardless of which of the two ABV categories they fall into. If one of those 12 fl oz cans is a craft beer with ABV of 7+% to 16% and the other contains less than 7% ABV, the consumer should be presented with an Alcohol Facts panel display immediately reflecting the differences at the level of the whole can or bottle. That is, they should see that the calories and alcohol content by serving are substantially different. Under TTB's current proposal to apply a 12 fl oz serving size to one can and a 5 fl oz serving size to the other, that would not be the case. The consumer would see information pertaining to the whole container for the lower ABV product and of a minor portion of the higher ABV product. If ""[s]erving size reference amounts are not intended as recommended consumption amounts but rather are intended to be used as a reference amount for the consumer to determine alcohol, nutrient, and calorie intake"" (quoting TTB Notice No. 237), then serving sizes should reflect common consumption amounts as they exist in practice. For beers in the 7% to 16% ABV range, that amount is 12 fl oz. Finally, if a different category must be established for beers greater than 7% ABV and up to 16%, then it should be a number of fluid ounces that divides into 12 fl oz without a remainder. Rather than 5 fl oz, the number should be 6 or 4. I propose 6 fl oz because, at half the volume of 12 fl oz, it would allow for easy mental math. 4 fl oz has a similar advantage at a third the volume of 12 fl oz and is also a common serving size for ""flights"" of beer (i.e., tasting samples). 5 fl oz is a standard serving size for the wine industry, but this matter of convenience introduces the complication of difficult mental math if consumers are to be given the tools to properly consider their choices among malt beverages.",ma5-pqgk-9b81,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,United States,,Philip,Glaser,,,,,2025-05-01 00:00:00,0,2025-06-24 22:03:29,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"This comment addresses TTB&#39;s request for input on serving sizes of malt beverages. In short, the second tier of beverages containing more than 7% alcohol by volume (ABV) and up to 16% ABV, which currently assigned a serving size of 5 fl oz in the proposal, should have a serving size of 12 oz because this reflects the way in which such beverages are typically consumed, i.e., in 12 fl oz bottles or cans. As TTB&rsquo;s proposal stands, only malt beverages containing 7% or less ABV are assigned a serving size of 12 fl oz. This prevents apples-to-apples comparison of such products at retail, obscuring alcohol content on a by-the-bottle (or can) basis, which is how people generally consume such beverages.<br/><br/>According to beeradvocate.com, a beer connoisseur and review website with tens of thousands of users and in operation since 1996, of the top ten &ldquo;Most Popular Beers,&rdquo; eight have over 7% ABV.

(2018), a randomized controlled trial found that when alcoholic beverages are labeled with clear information about Alcohol by Volume (ABV), and amount of pure alcohol content per serving, individuals aged 18-40 years, social and non- dependent drinkers are significantly less likely to select high strength drinks. These findings show quantitative labels of alcoholic drinks reduce the appeal of strong alcoholic beverages especially among individuals with low literacy levels about the risks of alcohol consumption, and groups that are at an elevated risk of binge drinking and impaired driving. Another study done by Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), conducted a national survey with the aim to receive consumer's opinion about transparency in labeling alcoholic beverages with information such as calories, serving size, nutritional content, and alcohol content, that are a part of the regulation, TTB-2025-0002, along with other alcohol facts. The sample for the survey was nationally representative of US adults from all demographics. This study found that 63% to 77% of respondents supported policies that required the inclusion of nutrition and alcohol content information on the labels of alcoholic beverages, either somewhat or strongly. Whereas, 72% to 90% of respondents supported having more information on the labels, as it would impact their choice to purchase alcohol. A systematic review done in the UK also shows moderate evidence of labeling calories and ABV on purchasing choices of consumers, showing increased preference for alcoholic beverages with calorie count labels, and a reduction in the purchase of high-calorie alcohol. While there is not much research done on evaluating the direct impact of labeling on ""Driving While Intoxicated"" (DWI) and alcohol related health issues among people in the US, The above evidence-based research shows the psychological impact of labelling on consumers purchasing and alcoholic beverage choices based on content, which in turn suggests an increase in consumer awareness about alcohol risks and a reduction in driving under the influence and health issue prevalence due to alcohol consumption. While labeling alcoholic beverages alone cannot eliminate the issue of impaired driving, it can be a valuable evidence-informed strategy to complement other policy tools such as age limits, taxes, and enforcement to help people make Informed health choices. Addressing Health Equity: Standardized ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels of alcoholic beverages would be an equitable and low-cost strategy in bridging the information gap.10 Rural and low-income communities often lack access to resources and education. Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of alcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate a lack of access to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities, causing them to face alcohol-related health issues. Recommendations: Integrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities that don't have literacy in English understand the information on the labels.

It reinforces the false narrative that sugar/carbs are inherently worse, despite being a nutrient essential for survival. Considered the following: 1. Public Perception: Sugar is Already Vilified • In recent years, sugar has been intensely demonized in public discourse, largely due to its association with obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. While these concerns are valid, they have led to a disproportionate fear of sugar compared to other harmful substances, including alcohol. • If sugar content is prominently displayed on alcohol labels, consumers may incorrectly assume that a lower-sugar alcohol is ""healthier,"" ignoring the far more harmful effects of alcohol itself. 2. Alcohol's Unique Metabolic Harm • The public often views sugar and calories as the main nutritional concerns, but alcohol has effects that far exceed those of sugar. For example: • Alcohol Suppresses Fat Burning: Even sugar doesn't impair fat oxidation as dramatically as alcohol does. • Toxic Byproducts: Alcohol metabolizes into acetaldehyde, a toxin, while sugar breaks down into glucose and fructose, which the body can utilize or store. • Highlighting sugar content on labels could distract from alcohol's inherently toxic nature and lead consumers to prioritize sugar levels over the far more significant health risks of alcohol consumption. 3. Alcohol's ""Hidden"" Calories and Nutritional Impact • Alcohol itself is calorically dense (7 calories per gram) and contributes ""empty"" calories with no nutritional benefit. These calories are metabolically disruptive, regardless of sugar content. • Low-sugar alcoholic beverages still carry the full burden of alcohol's toxic and caloric effects, but labeling them as ""low sugar"" could create a false sense of healthfulness. 4. Misleading Comparisons with Other Beverages • In soft drinks or juices, sugar content is a key health indicator because sugar is the primary source of calories and metabolic impact. However, in alcoholic beverages, sugar is a secondary factor—alcohol is the primary source of both calories and harm. • A sugary cocktail may appear ""worse"" than a low-sugar spirit on paper, but the spirit's alcohol content will have a far greater negative impact on metabolism and overall health than the sugar in the cocktail. 5. Encourages Misguided Consumer Choices • If sugar content is emphasized on labels, consumers may be tempted to choose alcoholic beverages with low sugar but higher alcohol content, believing they are making a healthier choice. This could inadvertently encourage higher alcohol consumption, increasing the risk of liver damage, addiction, and other alcohol-related harms. • For example, a vodka soda with zero sugar may be perceived as ""better"" than a beer with moderate sugar, even though the metabolic harm from the vodka (due to alcohol content) is significantly greater. 6. Focus Should Be on Alcohol Content • Alcohol's harmful effects—on metabolism, hormones, and organ health—are independent of its sugar content. The focus of labeling should remain on alcohol content (e.g., ABV) rather than secondary factors like sugar, to accurately communicate the primary health risks. • Informing consumers about the risks of alcohol itself, rather than its sugar content, provides a clearer picture of the metabolic harm associated with drinking. Conclusion Including sugar content on alcohol labels risks creating a misleading narrative that positions sugar as the primary health concern in alcoholic beverages, downplaying alcohol's inherently harmful effects. This could lead to misguided consumer choices, encouraging higher alcohol consumption under the guise of reducing sugar intake. To promote metabolic health, public awareness should focus on the dangers of alcohol itself, rather than deflecting attention to sugar.",m8g-d8dk-xr6p,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,Anonymous,Anonymous,,,,,2025-03-19 04:00:00,0,2025-06-24 22:04:28,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"Including sugar or carbohydrate content on alcohol labels, while seemingly informative, could be misleading because it frames sugar/carbs (carbohydrates are a sugar, after all) as the primary concern, overshadowing alcohol&rsquo;s more profound metabolic and nutritional impacts.

Increased Costs: The new labeling requirements impose significant financial burdens on producers, especially smaller craft brands. These costs stem from redesigning labels, undergoing compliance checks, and possibly halting production to implement new labeling. These expenses are likely to be passed on to consumers, increasing the cost of alcohol products without providing proportional value. 2. Innovation Stifling: Small and mid-sized enterprises, which are often the source of innovation within the industry, may find the cost of compliance prohibitive. This could limit the variety of products available to consumers and stifle the creativity that has driven the industry forward. 3. Consumer Overload: While the intent is to inform, there is a risk of overwhelming consumers with too much information, leading to confusion rather than clarity. Consumers benefit from clear, concise, and relevant product information. Overloading labels with detailed data might detract from key information that guides consumer decisions. 4. Market Entry Barriers: New entrants to the alcohol industry might find the enhanced labeling requirements a significant barrier. This could reduce competition in the industry, ultimately disadvantaging consumers who benefit from the competitive pressures that drive quality up and prices down. 5. International Trade Implications: Different countries have varied labeling requirements. The proposed changes could complicate international sales for U.S. producers, potentially limiting market access and reducing the diversity of products available domestically and abroad. In conclusion, while consumer protection and product transparency are crucial, the proposed labeling changes may lead to higher prices, reduced innovation, consumer confusion, greater barriers to market entry, and complications in international trade.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages - Request for 120-Day Extension for Comments  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the 
nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of U.S. wine exports .  Distilled Spirits 
Council of the United States (“DISCUS”) is the principal trade association for the leading 
producers and importers of distilled spirits products sold in the  U.S. and represents 
distillers of all sizes .  The Beer Institute (“BI”) represents the $ 409.2 billion beer industry – 
an industry that includes over 6,600 brewers and more than 2.4 million American jobs.  BI is 
a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing both large and 
small brewers, as well as importers and industry suppliers.  The Brewers Association (“BA”) 
seeks to promote and protect the interests of craft brewers and the craft brewing 
community, including beer consumers and home brewers. Today the BA  has roughly 5,000 
full voting brewery members – including members in every state – as well as over 1,000 allied 
trade members and over 30,000 home brewer and beer enthusiast members.   The National 
 
Page 2 of 4 
 
Beer Wholesalers Association’s (“NBWA”) purpose is to provide leadership, which 
enhances the independent beer and beverage distribution industry; to advocate before 
government and the public; to encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol; and to 
provide programs and services that will benefit its members.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of 
America (“WSWA”) is the only national membership organization of wine and spirits 
distributors.  On behalf of its more than 380 member companies, WSWA advocates on their 
behalf with regards to federal, state, regulatory, and legal issues impacting distributors and 
the beverage alcohol industry.   WineAmerica is the National Association of American 
Wineries, representing wineries, winery associations, and wine industry supply companies 
across the country.  WineAmerica’s mission is to encourage the dynamic growth and 
development of American wineries and winegrowing through the advancement and 
advocacy of sound public policy.  The American Craft Spirits Association (“ACSA”) the only 
national registered non-profit trade association representing the U.S. craft spirits industry. 
Its mission is to elevate and advocate for the community of craft spirits producers, and 
membership in ACSA is open to anyone. American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) i s a 
trade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in 
the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and 
around the world.  ADSA member companies represent over 70 percent of all distilled spirit 
sales nationwide. 
We refer to Wine Institute, DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA 
collectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   
 
The Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in  Notice No. 
237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(“Notice 237”).  The comment period for Notice 237 is scheduled to end on April 17, 2025. 
The Associa tions request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would 
extend to August 15, 2025. 
 
As a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily 
regulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of 
the new administration .  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in 
the final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the 
first day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries 
they regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into 
place since Notice 237 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and 
midsize wineries , c raft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great costs and 
operational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even 
meaningfully participating in  the comment process means they must redirect time and 
resources. 
 
Notice 237 is expansive—i.e., 53 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10-point, single -spaced 
font—and poses more than 90 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It 
is also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that it raises.  
Indeed, it has been over 17 years since TTB last raised these issues and it rightly recognizes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
in Notice 237 that the comments received almost two decades ago “may no longer fully and 
accurately reflect the opinions ” of industry members, trade associations, and other 
interested parties.  We agree with TTB that addressing this issue again years later necessarily 
requires updated input  and add that the beverage alcohol landscape has fundamentally 
evolved over the past 17 years.   That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of 
the proposed rule —including the many questions and requests fo r comments in Notice 
237—and for our members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit 
the overall process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. 
 
It is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 237  will 
impact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance 
of the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey 
the input of all our members to ensure their perspectives are included and well-reflected.  
Moreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 237 on important but sweeping areas of interest 
such as comments on “ any other options available to reduce regulatory burdens and 
economic costs while still providing the consumer with adequate information about the 
products in question .”  Our members will need additional time to consider other options 
available for those purposes and then explain and discuss them in submitted comments. 
 
Last, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that 
impact our members.  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing major food 
allergen labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same day as Notice 
237 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 237’s publication , 
the FDA published a rulemaking proposing front-of-package labeling for nutrition which will 
also impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 237, propose new 
rules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration.  We therefore believe a 
120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. 
 
We would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request.

Many do not realize the nutritional impact alcohol can have on one's diet beyond feeling tipsy. Alcohol can have a significantly high number of calories and, for some spirits, can contain ingredients that are common allergens. The implementation of a small QR code nearby the label would be a consideration but it is questionable how many people would pull out their phone, scan the QR code, wait for the page to load, etc, as opposed to taking 2 seconds to just reading the actual label. While there is some argument on an impact to small producers, this impact is outweighed by the benefit of greater transparency from producers on what exactly is being put in alcoholic drinks. Especially for a beverage that, even in small servings consumed over time, can cause significant impacts to health.

Many do not realize the nutritional impact alcohol can have on one&#39;s diet beyond feeling tipsy. Alcohol can have a significantly high number of calories and, for some spirits, can contain ingredients that are common allergens. The implementation of a small QR code nearby the label would be a consideration but it is questionable how many people would pull out their phone, scan the QR code, wait for the page to load, etc, as opposed to taking 2 seconds to just reading the actual label.<br/><br/>While there is some argument on an impact to small producers, this impact is outweighed by the benefit of greater transparency from producers on what exactly is being put in alcoholic drinks. Especially for a beverage that, even in small servings consumed over time, can cause significant impacts to health. Alcohol should not be given light treatment simply because its &quot;too much of a burden&quot; or &quot;not necessary&quot;.

  De  Maison  Selections  Inc.  is  a  small  business  with  20  employees  that  imports  fine  wine,  cider,  
and
 
spirits
 
from
 
small,
 
family-run
 
wineries
 
in
 
France
 
and
 
Spain.
 
We
 
are
 
commenting
 
on
 
the
 
questions
 
the
 
TTB
 
posed
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
rulemaking
 
notice.
   
  Overall  Comment  on  Proposed  Rulemaking:  Although  there  has  been  little  to  no  demand  for  nutritional  information  from  our  distributors  and  
consumers,
 
we
 
understand
 
the
 
motivations
 
behind
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.
 
Complying
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
would
 
require
 
us
 
to
 
incur
 
upfront
 
costs
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
time
 
and
 
money;
 
however,
 
we
 
appreciate
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
flexibility
 
regarding
 
nutrition
 
labeling,
 
COLA
 
approval,
 
thresholds,
 
and
 
nutrition
 
testing.
 
While
 
we
 
value
 
the
 
TTB's
 
allowance
 
for
 
the
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
label
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
linearly,
 
utilizing
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
would
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
update
 
information
 
and
 
align
 
with
 
EU
 
labeling
 
protocols.
 
We
 
are
 
thankful
 
for
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
implementation
 
of
 
a
 
five-year
 
period,
 
which
 
will
 
save
 
time
 
and
 
money
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
run.
 
Despite
 
the
 
potential
 
cost
 
savings,
 
the
 
new
 
labeling
 
requirement
 
would
 
impose
 
a
 
minimum
 
expense
 
of
 
$818,260
 
on
 
our
 
company.
 
Thus,
 
this
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
would
 
still
 
present
 
challenges
 
for
 
small
 
importers
 
and
 
producers.
 
Many
 
small
 
foreign
 
producers
 
struggle
 
to
 
comprehend
 
US
 
regulations
 
and
 
requirements,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
communicate
 
them
 
accurately
 
and
 
precisely
 
to
 
their
 
production
 
partners.
 
This
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
numerous
 
errors
 
in
 
attempts
 
at
 
compliance,
 
resulting
 
in
 
lost
 
time
 
and
 
resources.
 
We
 
estimate
 
that
 
fulfilling
 
the
 
proposed
 
regulations
 
will
 
increase
 
production
 
and
 
transit
 
times,
 
as
 
producers
 
must
 
invest
 
time
 
and
 
resources
 
to
 
meet
 
these
 
new
 
requirements.
  Serving  Facts  vs  Alcohol  Facts   Labeling  alcoholic  products  with  “Alcohol  Facts”  will  help  consumers  differentiate  between  
alcoholic
 
items
 
and
 
other
 
food
 
products.
 
""Alcohol
 
Facts""
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
more
 
accurate
 
descriptor
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
statement.
 
However,
 
voluntarily
 
labeled
 
products
 
will
 
incur
 
costs
 
to
 
transition
 
from
 
""Serving
 
Facts""
 
to
 
""Alcohol
 
Facts.""
  Alcohol  Facts  Labeling   The  back  label  of  a  wine  or  spirit  is  valuable  real  estate  that  includes  what  consumers  desire,  such  as  the  terroir,  grape  varieties,  and  the  technical  skills  of  the  winemaker  (Bettaglene,  2014).  Including  alcohol  facts  on  the  back  label  reduces  space  for  these  attributes  and  may  hinder  
small
 
wine
 
producers'
 
ability
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
consumers.
 
We
 
recognize
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
consumers
 
are
 
wine
 
connoisseurs;
 
however,
 
consumers
 
may
 
be
 
inclined
 
to
 
purchase
 
a
 
product
 
if
 
the
 producer  shares  an  authentic  story,  fostering  trust  with  specific  regions  and  producers  (Tortolero  Cervantes,  2023).  With  the  increasing  requirement  for  warning  statements  and  sulfite  content,  a  QR  code  or  linear  Alcohol  Facts  label  would  allow  producers  to  showcase  important  attributes  
consumers
 
want
 
while
 
providing
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
and
 
allergens.
 
  Linear  Alcohol  Facts  Statement:    We  oppose  the  back  label’s  nutrient  statement  aligning  with  the  nutrition  facts  label  found  on  
foods
 
under
 
the
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction.
 
Eighteen
 
percent
 
of
 
individuals
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
read
 
wine
 
labels;
 
among
 
those
 
who
 
do,
 
shorter
 
ingredient
 
lists
 
or
 
clean-labeled
 
wines
 
without
 
listed
 ingredients  are  preferred  (Pabst  et  al.,  2021).  Therefore,  we  endorse  the  linear  label,  which  contains  all  the  information  required  by  the  TTB  while  also  allowing  for  listing  wine  attributes.   QR  Codes:    We  advocate  using  QR  codes  on  labels,  enabling  consumers  to  access  mandatory  Alcohol  
Facts
 
statements
 
and
 
allergen
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices.
 
QR
 
codes
 
are
 
also
 
required
 
in
 
the
 
EU,
 
and
 
producers
 
can
 
include
 
the
 
US
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
regulations
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
webpage,
 
thereby
 
reducing
 
the
 
regulatory
 
burden
 
on
 
these
 
small
 
businesses.
 
  Commenters  noted  that  not  everyone  has  a  cell  phone,  particularly  those  over  65,  and  that  tribal  
lands
 
and
 
rural
 
areas
 
often
 
lack
 
sufficient
 
4G
 
LTE
 
coverage.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
FCC
 
Broadband
 
Data
 
Collection,
 
as
 
of
 
June
 
30,
 
2024,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
US
 
has
 
between
 
40%
 
and
 
100%
 
access
 
to
 
4G
 LTE  data  ( FCC  National  Broadband  Map ,  2025).  The  STARLINK  availability  map  reveals  that  most  of  the  US  (>=99%),  even  in  rural  areas,  has  access  to  high-speed  internet  ( Starlink ,  2025).  Therefore,  consumers  will  likely  access  QR  codes  on  their  mobile  devices  within  five  years.  In  
2023,
 
97%
 
of
 
18-49-year-olds
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
and
 
89%
 
of
 
those
 
aged
 
50-64
 
owned
 
one.
 
Although
 
only
 
76%
 
of
 
individuals
 
aged
 
65
 
and
 
older
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
this
 
trend
 
has
 increased  from  46%  in  2018  to  61%  in  2021  ( Smartphone  Ownership  in  the  US  by  Age  2023 ,  2025).  Across  all  age  groups,  smartphone  ownership  is  on  the  rise,  and  this  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  coming  years.  Thus,  the  commenters'  concerns  about  the  lack  of  smartphone  
ownership
 
and
 
coverage
 
are
 
unfounded.
  Labeling  Requirements  and  Competition:   As  a  small  business  importing  wine  and  distilled  spirits  from  family-owned  vineyards,  these  new  
requirements
 
will
 
increase
 
costs
 
for
 
our
 
business
 
and
 
foreign
 
producers.
 
We
 
applaud
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
FDA
 
Labeling
 
Cost
 
Model
 
to
 
estimate
 
a
 
per
 
UPC
 
price
 
for
 
label
 
redesign
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
finding
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
$1,636.52
 
per
 
UPC
 
fair.
 
However,
 
we
 
must
 
hire
 
another
 
employee
 
to
 
manage
 
graphic
 
design,
 
web
 
development,
 
and
 
data
 
analytics
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
new
 
requirements.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
incur
 
costs
 
for
 
health
 
insurance,
 
training,
 
and
 
benefits
 
for
 
the
 
new
 
hire.
 
With
 
between
 
400
 
and
 
500
 
UPCs,
 
our
 
minimum
 
costs
 
would
 
range
 
from
 
$654,608
 
to
 
$818,260,
 
which
 
may
 
limit
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
sell
 
wine
 
and
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
market.
 
We
 
commend
 
the
 
TTB
 
for
 
not
 
requiring
 
a
 
new
 
COLA,
 
allowing
 
thresholds,
 
and
 
permitting
 
one-time
 
testing
 
of
 
each
 
product.
 
  Implementation  Period:    We  agree  with  the  five-year  implementation  period.  This  will  provide  our  producers  sufficient  
time
 
to
 
use
 
existing
 
labels
 
and
 
print
 
new
 
ones
 
with
 
alcohol
 
facts.
 
The
 
number
 
of
 
labels
 
the
 
producer
 
has
 
printed
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
the
 
final
 
rule
 
is
 
established
 
will
 
determine
 
if
 
our
 
compliance
 
period
 
is
 
shorter
 
than
 
five
 
years.

RATIONALE IN SUPPORT OF REJECTING THE RULE: 1. Consumer confusion has been identified in prior rulemaking and, notably, in this scenario, dietary disclosure lacks demonstrable necessity. People do not consume alcohol for nutritional content, and to suggest otherwise may be at cross purposes to regulations that support responsible alcohol consumption. Proscriptions can avoid market deceptions. Absent a documented market failure, dietary labeling mandates violate rules of necessity (APA §706(2)(A). 2. The economic burden of dietary testing and compliance, particularly considering limited editions, seasonal variations, and batch variations, would be disproportionately borne by small businesses in an industry of aggressive consolidative pressures and marketing obstacles. Small businesses cannot offset recurrent costs through economies of scale. Further, this cost overrun undermines the public benefit, such as through less consumer choice and signal noise. The proposal has not considered less burdensome alternatives such as voluntary and QR disclosures. 3. The proposed rule disrupts established conventions to use limited label space, responsible free speech, and aesthetics. Signals must relate to qualifiers that aid consumers in making informed choices about product differentiation. Consumers may not object to the abstract idea of dietary information on a label; however, they look to qualifiers such as region, source ingredients, production methods, and sustainability. The proposed rule would, therefore, conflict with the comprehensive labeling framework (27 CFR 4.32—4.'). Additional label information would unintentionally increase container sizes. 4. Alcohol consumption is declining significantly among Gen Z. Regulatory cues that accentuate limited dietary benefits would reinforce avoidance behaviors, shift comparison to dietary content of non-alcoholic alternatives, diminish the stated benefits of the regulation, and may represent regulatory overreach. Further, the NIH knows that similar regulations have disparate impacts on socioeconomic groups, including gender, race, and ethnicity. Babor, T. et al. (2010).

Consumer confusion has been identified in prior rulemaking and, notably, in this scenario, dietary disclosure lacks demonstrable necessity.  People do not consume alcohol for nutritional content, and to suggest otherwise may be at cross purposes to regulations that support responsible alcohol consumption.   Proscriptions can avoid market deceptions.  Absent a documented market failure, dietary labeling mandates violate rules of necessity (APA &sect;706(2)(A). <br/><br/>2.  The economic burden of dietary testing and compliance, particularly considering limited editions, seasonal variations, and batch variations, would be disproportionately borne by small businesses in an industry of aggressive consolidative pressures and marketing obstacles.   Small businesses cannot offset recurrent costs through economies of scale. Further, this cost overrun undermines the public benefit, such as through less consumer choice and signal noise.  The proposal has not considered less burdensome alternatives such as voluntary and QR disclosures. <br/><br/>3. The proposed rule disrupts established conventions to use limited label space, responsible free speech, and aesthetics. Signals must relate to qualifiers that aid consumers in making informed choices about product differentiation.   Consumers may not object to the abstract idea of dietary information on a label; however, they look to qualifiers such as region, source ingredients, production methods, and sustainability. The proposed rule would, therefore, conflict with the comprehensive labeling framework (27 CFR 4.32&mdash;4.39). Additional label information would unintentionally increase container sizes.<br/><br/>4.  Alcohol consumption is declining significantly among Gen Z.  Regulatory cues that accentuate limited dietary benefits would reinforce avoidance behaviors, shift comparison to dietary content of non-alcoholic alternatives, diminish the stated benefits of the regulation, and may represent regulatory overreach.   Further, the NIH knows that similar regulations have disparate impacts on socioeconomic groups, including gender, race, and ethnicity. <br/><br/>Babor, T. et al. (2010).

2 of 4Comments from P. R. China on United States Notification
G/TBT/N/USA/2182
1. The draft regulation required all alcohol beverage labels regulated by TTB to
disclose the alcohol content, calories, and nutritional information of each beverage in
the ""alcohol content"" statement. Due to the fact that alcoholic beverages are mainly
composed of ethanol and water, and do not contain conventional nutrients such as
protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc., for example, distilled spirits almost do not contain
these components. If the product does not add nutritional fortifiers or make nutritional
claims, labeling the nutritional content table is meaningless; Fermented alcoholic
beverages (such as beer and fruit wine) may contain small amounts of carbohydrates,
and it may consider adding only labeled carbohydrates as appropriate. However, beer
labels also require labeling malt content, therefore, labeling carbohydrates is not very
meaningful for consumers. For ordinary consumers, the nutritional value of alcoholic
beverages is limited, and labeling indicators such as carbohydrates may be misleading
(such as implying that they have nutritional supplementation functions). The
additional and unnecessary laboratory analysis costs incurred are also a heavy burden
for producers or traders.
According to the relevant standards of the CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission),
most countries do not require the labeling of conventional nutrients such as protein,
fat, carbohydrates, etc. for alcoholic beverages. The provision of Regulation (EU) No
1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Provision of Food
Information to Consumers concerning the ingredient list and nutrition declaration for
alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content exceeding 1.2% is non-mandatory. When
the nutrition statement for alcoholic beverages is voluntarily provided, it is limited to
energy values only.
Based on the principle of scientific evidence and necessity, it is recommended that the
United States should coordinate its requirements for alcoholic beverage labeling with
international standards, or differentiated the requirements according to the different
product forms of alcoholic beverages: consider not mandating the labeling of
conventional nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc. on ordinary alcoholic
beverage labels as appropriate; If additional ingredients such as sugar, juice, or other
nutritional enhancers are added to alcoholic beverages, the carbohydrate content or
other nutrient content may be indicated according to the actual situation. To avoid
excessive regulation, reduce compliance costs for businesses, and alleviate the burden
on small and medium-sized enterprises.
2. The draft regulation required the addition of new subpart L - alcohol factual
statements in Parts 4, 5, and 7 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
The current regulations require the display of information such as alcohol content,
carmine, sulfite, etc. The proposed rule required an addition of alcohol factual
statements such as single portion size, number of portions per container, and liquid
ounces per unit of pure ethanol, and the liquid ounce information per unit of pure
ethanol should be accurate to one tenth of the liquid ounce. The provision differs from
international standards and may impose additional costs and burdens on alcoholic
beverage manufacturers and importers, especially small businesses. It is
recommended that the United States should maintain the current regulations without
3 of 4adding the provision and not mandating the labeling of information such as ""single
portion size, number of portions per container, and number of ounces of pure ethanol
per serving"" to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade.
Comments in Chinese are as below:
1、 规章修订提案中要求所有受TTB 监管的酒精饮料标签“酒精含量”声明
中必须披露每份饮料的酒精含量、 卡路里及营养成分信息。 由于酒精饮料的主要
成分为乙醇和水， 基本不含蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素，比如蒸馏
酒几乎不含这些成分， 若产品未添加营养强化剂或未进行营养声称， 则标示营养
成分表毫无意义；发酵酒（如啤酒、果酒）可能含有少量碳水化合物，可以酌情
考虑仅添加标示碳水化合物， 但啤酒标签也已要求标注麦芽度， 因此标示碳水化
合物对于消费者也无太大意义。对普通消费者而言，酒精饮料的营养价值有限，
标注碳水化合物等指标可能产生误导（如暗示其具有营养补充功能） 。其产生额
外的、不必要的实验室分析费用对生产商或贸易商来说也是繁重的负担。
根据食品法典委员会的相关标准， 国际上绝大多数国家对酒精饮料不强制要
求标注蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物等常规营养素。欧盟（EU）第 1169/2011 号条
例《关于向消费者提供食品信息》涉及酒精含量超过 1.2%的酒精饮料提供成分
清单、营养声明的规定属于非强制性条款，当酒精饮料营养声明是自愿提供时，
营养声明仅限于能量值。
本着科学性与必要性， 建议美方对酒精饮料标签的要求与国际标准协调一致，
也可根据酒精饮料的不同产品形式区分要求： 酌情考虑不强制普通酒精饮料标签
标注蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素； 若酒精饮料中额外添加了糖、果
汁等配料， 或使用其他营养强化剂的， 可根据实际情况要求标示碳水化合物含量
或其他营养素含量。以避免过度监管，降低企业合规成本与中小企业的负担。
2、规章修订提案中要求在《美国联邦法规》第27 篇第 4、5、7 部分中分别
增加新的子部分 L——酒精事实陈述条款。 现行法规已要求显示酒精含量、 胭脂
红、 亚硫酸盐等信息， 该拟议规则要求增加单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯
乙醇的液体盎司数等酒精事实声明， 且每份纯乙醇的液体盎司信息需精确到液体
盎司的十分之一。 该条款与国际通行标准存在差异， 会给酒精饮料制造商和进口
商， 特别是小企业带来额外的成本和负担。 建议美方维持现行法规， 不增加该条

Summary of the Regulation This proposed TTB rule revises labeling, registration, and enforcement criteria for alcohol products to promote transparency on ingredients, health warnings, and environmental impact. By focusing on clear disclosures, it aims to advance consumer protection, facilitate equitable market access for small producers, and encourage more sustainable production practices. 2. Related Case Studies and Examples Scottish Alcohol Labeling Initiative (Scotland) - Scenario: Public Health Scotland found that clearer alcohol labeling helped reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions by 4% (source: Public Health Scotland, 2022, https://publichealthscotland.scot). - Proposal: Adopt similarly prominent health disclaimers in the U.S. context, aligning with TTB's efforts to include expanded warning text in labeling requirements. California Sustainable Winegrowing Program (California) - Scenario: This program's rigorous environmental standards lowered water usage by 15% in participating vineyards (source: California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, 2021, https://www.sustainablewinegrowing.org). - Proposal: Incorporate verifiable sustainability metrics in TTB labeling rules, giving producers the option to display recognized eco-certifications. Alcohol Tax Reform (Iceland) - Scenario: Iceland's progressive tax structure, which adjusts levies based on alcohol content, helped reduce overall consumption (source: European Journal of Public Health, 2020, DOI:10.1093/eurpub/ckz185). - Proposal: Explore targeted taxation strategies under TTB oversight that incentivize lower-alcohol or responsibly produced beverages. Cooperative Brewing Ventures (Various U.S. States) - Scenario: Worker-owned breweries in Oregon and Colorado reported increased employee retention and community engagement (source: Democracy at Work Institute, 2020, https://institute.coop). - Proposal: Facilitate accessible TTB licensing pathways for cooperative models to expand equitable ownership in alcohol production. 3.

TTB–2025–0002 and TTB–2025–0003). This issue is especially meaningful to me on a personal level. Over the past three years, I have undergone a major transformation in my health and lifestyle, losing over 100 pounds through deliberate choices and a commitment to understanding the nutritional content of what I consume. After years of struggling with my weight and related health issues, I've learned firsthand how crucial transparent labeling is in making informed, health-conscious decisions. Alcohol is often part of our culture, tied to celebrations and social occasions. I do not want to avoid these moments; I simply want to be able to make informed decisions when I participate in them. Unfortunately, unlike nearly every other consumable product, alcohol is not required to disclose basic information such as calories, ingredients, or allergens. This lack of transparency is unfair, outdated, and out of step with consumer expectations and health needs. I strongly urge the TTB to move forward with finalizing these proposals and to require full ingredient, nutrition, and allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages for several key reasons: 1. Empowering Health-Conscious Consumers – People like me who are managing their health need accurate nutritional information to make intentional choices. This information is essential—not optional—for supporting long-term health. 2. Consumer Right to Know – It is only reasonable that consumers be given the same level of transparency for alcohol as is provided for food, soda, or even bottled water. We deserve to know what's in the products we consume. 3. Safety and Allergen Disclosure – Hidden ingredients and allergens can pose real dangers. Requiring full disclosure helps protect individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or intolerances. 4. Public Demand – The majority of Americans support this change. Transparency builds trust, supports public health, and aligns with the growing demand for cleaner, more informed choices. Consumers deserve clarity, safety, and the ability to make deliberate decisions about their health - especially in a product category as widely consumed as alcohol.

Alcohol is often part of our culture, tied to celebrations and social occasions. I do not want to avoid these moments; I simply want to be able to make informed decisions when I participate in them. Unfortunately, unlike nearly every other consumable product, alcohol is not required to disclose basic information such as calories, ingredients, or allergens. This lack of transparency is unfair, outdated, and out of step with consumer expectations and health needs. I strongly urge the TTB to move forward with finalizing these proposals and to require full ingredient, nutrition, and allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages for several key reasons: 1. Empowering Health-Conscious Consumers – People like me who are managing their health need accurate nutritional information to make intentional choices. This information is essential—not optional—for supporting long-term health. 2. Consumer Right to Know – It is only reasonable that consumers be given the same level of transparency for alcohol as is provided for food, soda, or even bottled water. We deserve to know what's in the products we consume. 3. Safety and Allergen Disclosure – Hidden ingredients and allergens can pose real dangers. Requiring full disclosure helps protect individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or intolerances. 4. Public Demand – The majority of Americans support this change. Transparency builds trust, supports public health, and aligns with the growing demand for cleaner, more informed choices. Consumers deserve clarity, safety, and the ability to make deliberate decisions about their health - especially in a product category as widely consumed as alcohol.

SENT VIA ONLINE PUBLIC COMMENT 
SUBJECT: Support for Mandatory Nutrition and Ingredient Labeling on Alcoholic Beverages  
Dear TTB Administrator, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed rules requiring standardized nutrition 
and ingredient labeling on alcoholic beverages (Docket Nos. TTB–2025–0002 and TTB–2025–0003). 
This issue is especially meaningful to me on a personal level. Over the past three years, I have 
undergone a major transformation in my health and lifestyle, losing over 100 pounds through 
deliberate choices and a commitment to understanding the nutritional content of what I consume. 
After years of struggling with my weight and related health issues, I’ve learned ﬁrsthand how crucial 
transparent labeling is in making informed, health-conscious decisions. 
Alcohol is often part of our culture, tied to celebrations and social occasions. I do not want to avoid 
these moments; I simply want to be able to make informed decisions when I participate in them. 
Unfortunately, unlike nearly every other consumable product, alcohol is not required to disclose 
basic information such as calories, ingredients, or allergens. This lack of transparency is unfair, 
outdated, and out of step with consumer expectations and health needs. 
I strongly urge the TTB to move forward with ﬁnalizing these proposals and to require full ingredient, 
nutrition, and allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages for several key reasons: 
1. Empowering Health-Conscious Consumers – People like me who are managing their 
health need accurate nutritional information to make intentional choices. This information 
is essential—not optional—for supporting long-term health. 
2. Consumer Right to Know – It is only reasonable that consumers be given the same level of 
transparency for alcohol as is provided for food, soda, or even bottled water. We deserve to 
know what’s in the products we consume. 
3. Safety and Allergen Disclosure – Hidden ingredients and allergens can pose real dangers. 
Requiring full disclosure helps protect individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or 
intolerances. 
4. Public Demand – The majority of Americans support this change. Transparency builds 
trust, supports public health, and aligns with the growing demand for cleaner, more 
informed choices. 
Consumers deserve clarity, safety, and the ability to make deliberate decisions about their health - 
especially in a product category as widely consumed as alcohol. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for your work on this important initiative.

Re: Docket ID No. TTB-2025-0002, Proposed Rule – Alcohol Beverage Labeling Requirements 
(Alcohol Facts Statement)
Position and Background of the Regulation:
I am writing in strong support of the proposed regulation TTB-20205-0002 issued by the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau which mandated the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” panel on 
labels of distilled spirits, wines and malt beverages across the United States.1 As a Master of 
Public Health student, I believe this regulation is a crucial step towards improving consumer’s 
health literacy about risks of excessive alcohol consumption, enables them to make informed 
health decisions, and reduce alcohol-related harm to health.1 This proposed regulation requires 
labels to include per-serving information such as alcohol content, calorie count, serving size and 
basic nutritional information.1 These changes are long overdue and reflect public health best 
practices. Importantly, this regulation is at the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) stage 
which invites public comments prior to finalization.1 As a student studying public health policy, I 
realize that this phase is a vital opportunity for stakeholders, public, researchers and 
professionals to shape regulations that directly impact the health and lives of people.1 Public 
commenting is not just a democratic mechanism but it is a critical tool that aligns regulatory 
actions with evidence and equity.
Health Risks of Alcohol Consumption:
Road traffic accidents are a pressing public health issue in the US with 32 people dying of 
automobile crashes each year involving alcohol impaired driving accounting for 1 death in every 
45 minutes.2 According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), driving 
under influence deaths were highest among young individuals aged 21 to 24 yrs (29%) and 25-34 
yrs (28%).3 Excessive consumption of alcohol causes 178,000 deaths each year in the US, and 
leads to chronic heart and liver diseases, stroke, digestive issues, cancer and weakened immune 
system.4,5 It also has caused shorter life span leading individuals to die by an average of 24 
years.4 Effective regulations like TTB-2025-0002 can help reduce deaths by making people 
choose to limit their alcohol consumption.4 
Evidence-Based Impact of Labelling Alcoholic Beverages:
According to Vasiljevic, M. et al. (2018), a randomized controlled trial found that when 
alcoholic beverages are labeled with clear information about Alcohol by Volume (ABV), and 
amount of pure alcohol content per serving, individuals aged 18-40 years, social and non-
dependent drinkers are significantly less likely to select high strength drinks.6 These finds show 
that quantitative labels of alcoholic drinks reduces the appeal to strong alcoholic beverages 
especially among individuals with low literacy levels about the risks of alcohol consumption, and 
groups that are at an elevated risk of binge drinking and impaired driving.6 Another study done by Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), conducted a national survey with an aim to 
receive consumer’s opinion about transparency in labeling alcoholic beverages with information 
such as calories, serving size, nutritional content, and alcohol content, that are a part of the 
regulation, TTB-2025-0002, along with other alcohol facts.7 The sample for the survey was 
nationally representative with US adults from all demographics.7 This study found that 63% to 
77% respondents supported policies that required the inclusion of nutrition and alcohol content 
information on the labels of alcoholic beverages, either somewhat or strongly.7 Whereas, 72% to 
90% respondents supported having more information on the labels as it would impact their 
choice to purchase alcohol.7 A systematic review done in the UK also shows moderate evidence 
of labeling calories and ABV on purchasing choices of consumers showing increased preference 
for alcoholic beverages with calorie count labels, and reduction in purchase of high calorie 
alcohol.8 While there is not much research done on evaluating the direct impact of labeling on 
“Driving While Intoxicated” (DWI) and alcohol related health issues among people in the US, 
the above evidence-based research shows the psychological impact of labelling on consumers 
purchasing and alcoholic beverage choices based on content, that in turn suggests an increase in 
consumer awareness about alcohol risks and a reduction in driving under influence and health 
issue prevalence due to alcohol consumption.6,7,8 While labeling alcoholic beverages alone 
cannot eliminate the issue of impaired driving, it can be a valuable evidence-informed strategy to 
complement other policy tools such as age limits, taxes and enforcement to help people make 
informed health choices.9
Addressing Health Equity:
Standardized “Alcohol Facts” panel on labels of alcoholic beverages would be an equitable and 
low cost strategy in bridging information gap.10 Rural and low-income communities often lack 
access to resources and education.11 Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and 
educational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of 
alcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate lack of 
access to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities causing them to face 
alcohol-related health issues.
Recommendations:
Integrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities who don’t have literacy 
in English understand the information on the labels. Having alcohol facts panels on labels in 
different commonly spoken languages in the US would help people understand it and make 
informed health choices.
Conclusion:
I commend the proposed regulation, TTB-2025-0002, as it supports evidence based strategies. 
The nation has witnessed horrifying incidences such as the case of Jacqueline Saburido, who had 
to suffer from third degree burns due to her car being hit by a heavily intoxicated.13 The people 
of our country must never have to go through such experiences. TTB-2025-0002 can make this 
happen. Therefore, I request the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to immediately 
finalize and implement the regulation to protect the lives and health of all communities in the 
United States.1 TTB-2025-0002 ensures equity, helps alcohol risk communication and reduces 
alcohol-related harm.1References

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
To Whom it May Concern, 
 
The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. Founded in 
1928, ASN is the nation’s leading society for nutrition research and practice, representing more 
than 8,000 professional members across 100 countries. Our members – including nutrition 
scientists, physicians, dietitians, and other stakeholders – are dedicated to advancing our mission 
of “A Healthier World Through Evidence-Based Nutrition.” ASN supports the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) efforts to implement labeling of alcohol content and 
nutritional information on alcoholic beverages, as this will impart important information to 
consumers that they need to make informed health and nutrition-related purchases and decisions. 
 
The “Alcohol Facts” panel in the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the 
number of calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.” 
This information is important to promote transparency regarding the contents of alcoholic 
beverages, and to highlight health and safety information for those who consume alcohol. 
Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after 
tobacco and obesity, increasing risk for at least seven types of cancer
1. Alcoholic beverages can 
be calorie-dense and therefore contribute to diet-related chronic diseases. On average, alcohol 
accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.2 Many alcoholic beverages also contain 
added sugars and other nutrients to limit. 
 
As such, the proposed rule could be strengthened by also requiring additional nutritional content, 
including total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in 
milligrams, and a percent Daily Value for each of these nutrients based on a 2,000-calorie diet. 
 
 
1 Alcohol and Cancer Risk 2025: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory. US Department of Health and Human 
Services, Office of the Surgeon General. January 3, 2025. 
2 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.   
 
The final rule should also require the number of standard drinks per container (instead of the 
proposed number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), and the conversion between 
standard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. TTB may also consider dual-column 
labeling for certain alcoholic beverages for those that are customarily consumed in one sitting. 
This label has two columns, one for listing the nutritional facts related to a single serving and one 
listing the nutritional facts for the contents of the entire package. 
 
ASN supports the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on 
alcoholic beverage packages and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a 
webpage), as this would specifically disadvantage populations that may be less likely to utilize 
technology to gain this important health and safety information.  
 
ASN urges TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts 
rule to ensure that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to 
drink. To ensure timely consumer access to this important information, the final rule should 
adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed. 
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration of the American Society for Nutrition’s comments 
on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
Please contact Sarah Ohlhorst, MS, RD, ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer 
(sohlhorst@nutrition.org; 240-428-3647) for more information. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John E. Courtney, PhD 
Chief Executive Officer

While I understand and support transparency for consumers, I urge the TTB to consider the unique challenges these changes would pose for small producers like us. Many small wineries, including mine, purchase labels in bulk to manage costs. The current option to use the generic term ""table wine"" with a standard alcohol range allows us to print labels in larger quantities, which significantly reduces our per-label cost. If we are required to print specific alcohol content on each label, this would necessitate annual or even batch-specific printing in smaller runs. The financial burden of this—both in cost per label and in managing multiple inventories—could be significant for operations producing under 2,000 cases per year. I respectfully propose the TTB consider an exemption or alternate compliance option for small wineries selling fewer than 2,000 cases annually. A carveout like this would help preserve the viability of small producers while still allowing flexibility for consumer transparency. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.

Non-alcoholic beers are a growing product category(1) and market research suggests that consumers find the definition of these products confusing.(2) In 2023, the World Health Organization called for updated labeling mandates to ensure potential consumers are not misled by product descriptors and to protect groups seeking to abstain from alcohol.(3) If the TTB proposal is approved, non-alcoholic beers would be required to report alcohol content either in terms of percentage or through terminology: using the term non-alcoholic (for those with <0.5% alcohol by volume) or the term, alcohol-free (for those with 0.0% alcohol by volume). If the term non-alcoholic is used, then alcohol percentage would also be required, but this is not the case for the term alcohol-free. To ensure consumers receive consistent, clear information that facilitates understanding of different terms, both alcohol by volume percentage and concordant terminology should be required. In fact, as a non-alcoholic beverage researcher, I recently evaluated non-alcoholic beer labels and found that all of the sample evaluated included both alcohol by volume percentage and relevant terminology on their labels, suggesting that a new requirement to include both would not involve an overhaul of current labeling practices. With regard to nutritional content, the Food and Drug Administration requires that soft drinks (e.g., sodas, juices) include nutritional content on their labels and, if the TTB proposal is approved, full-strength alcohol would follow suit. A question from the TTB is whether non-alcoholic beers should be exempt from the nutritional content requirement. There is no reason for non-alcoholic beers to be exempt from this – caloric content influences beverage purchasing decisions(4) and consumers have a right to nutritional information to make informed decisions. To offer a clinical perspective, as a clinical psychologist, I have provided therapy for a client who had alcohol use disorder and who found value in using non-alcoholic beers to support abstinence from alcohol use, yet the client also had concern about carbohydrate intake due to co-occurring diabetes. Nutritional content on non-alcoholic beers would support awareness of carbohydrate content, with potential to shape health behavior. Further, in my assessment of non-alcoholic beers, the majority assessed included calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content on their labels, indicating that most producers would be amenable to a new nutritional content requirement. Also worth comment and absent from the TTB proposal is consumer communication about who should avoid non-alcoholic beers (and other non-alcoholic beverages that mirror alcohol). Certain kombucha companies voluntarily include on their label a warning against consumption for people avoiding alcohol (e.g., due to pregnancy, sensitivities), as the fermentation process can yield up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. A similar warning on non-alcoholic beers may be worthwhile. While non-alcoholic beers can be a helpful substitute for some,(5) their alcohol cues may activate craving for full-strength alcohol.(6) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included the mandated government health warning for alcohol. Arguably, a consumer communication that is tailored to the specific (non-alcoholic) product would be more relevant and informative than simply using the warning required for full-strength alcohol. Another consideration is whether minors should be permitted to consume non-alcoholic beers(7,8) – labels that clearly note to avoid consumption if avoiding alcohol may guide parent considerations about providing non-alcoholic beers to their children.(9) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included an age-restriction. As federal and state regulations evolve regarding at what age non-alcoholic beers can be purchased, relevant labeling will need to track. At present non-alcoholic beer labeling is largely self-regulated. I appreciate the opportunity to offer comment, informed by both my research and clinical experiences, to support effective labeling strategies of non-alcoholic beers. References 1. NielsenIQ.

Repeat X amount times when comparing brands.<br/><br/>Proponents of this rule change are projecting their loftiest ideals on how they think the average consumer will behave. The average consumer spends single digit seconds selecting products in the grocery or convenience store. With regards to beer, the primary factors of a purchase are branding, price, and ABV. <br/><br/>The status quo works. In my personal experience, the proponents are unabashed about contacting the manufacturer and asking their nutritional questions. Requiring the information to be accessible via a QR code does not save them time, does not effect the average consumer and creates an expensive strain on the small manufacturer. <br/>",0,17,"[17, -1, -1]",17,-1,-1,approval,0.4649657905101776,"{'admiration': 0.004334515426307917, 'amusement': 0.00039831263711676, 'anger': 0.00044768102816306055, 'annoyance': 0.004561032168567181, 'approval': 0.4649657905101776, 'caring': 0.0017743832431733608, 'confusion': 0.022832173854112625, 'curiosity': 0.0016320471186190844, 'desire': 0.0018508135108277202, 'disappointment': 0.005790103226900101, 'disapproval': 0.16396784782409668, 'disgust': 0.0005487307789735496, 'embarrassment': 0.00038996763760223985, 'excitement': 0.0008571768412366509, 'fear': 0.00039898138493299484, 'gratitude': 0.0030304412357509136, 'grief': 0.0001596072397660464, 'joy': 0.0009937704307958484, 'love': 0.0012401267886161804, 'nervousness': 0.0003115498402621597, 'optimism': 0.027043037116527557, 'pride': 0.0004367230867501348, 'realization': 0.02421228587627411, 'relief': 0.001323003671132028, 'remorse': 0.00044966491986997426, 'sadness': 0.0006278816144913435, 'surprise': 0.0008425550768151879, 'neutral': 0.2645796835422516}"

Comments on Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages. 
 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
To Whom It May Concern,  
We are writing on behalf of the ""Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C."" (CIVYL), 
the united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of 
wines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, Casa 
Cuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and Pernod 
Ricard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and implementation 
of public policies related to alcoholic beverages. 
Firstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and 
contribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is 
dedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of 
alcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately 
inform consumers without causing confusion. 
In this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code 
of Federal Regulations under Notice No. 237, which would mandate the inclusion of an ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel on the labeling of alcoholic beverages. 
We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect consumers. However, we believe 
that requiring the inclusion of nutritional information on labeling may not provide significant benefits to 
consumers as the primary objective of alcoholic beverage labeling, from a public health perspective, is to 
promote responsible alcohol consumption and prevent harmful alcohol use. Including nutritional 
information on these beverages may create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" 
potentially leading to consumer confusion. 
Alcohol should not be considered a product that provides nutrients to the consumer. Including 
nutritional information on labels could mislead consumers into believing that alcoholic beverages are part 
of a balanced diet or provide essential nutrients. This could influence purchasing decisions in a way that 
diverts attention from critical aspects such as alcohol content. Additionally, comparing the 
nutritional values of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages may be misleading, as their 
characteristics and intended purposes are fundamentally different. Factors such as caloric content, 
carbohydrates, sugars, or fats in alcoholic beverages should not be equated with those of conventional 
foods, given that alcohol itself is the primary differentiating component. In Mexico, legislation prohibits 
alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits, as well as therapeutic, curative, or 
rehabilitative properties. 
In Mexico, according to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising for these products must be 
limited to informing them about their characteristics, quality, and production techniques, without 
presenting them as sources of well-being or health. Furthermore, Article 307 states that the advertising 
of food and non-alcoholic beverages should not be directly or indirectly associated with the consumption 
of alcoholic beverages nor induce harmful eating habits. Lastly, Article 6 of the General Health Law 
Regulations on Advertising establishes that product advertising must not attribute preventive, 
therapeutic, rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or other qualities to them. This reinforces the 
prohibition of attributing nutritional value or properties that do not correspond to alcoholic beverages. 
Rather than being useful, these statements could directly cause consumer confusion. 
 
 
 
  
Furthermore, implementing this measure would represent an additional cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors of alcoholic beverages. This would contravene Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which prohibits imposing technical regulations that 
create unnecessary obstacles to international trade without a justification based on legitimate 
objectives of member states. We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect 
consumers. However, we believe that the labeling requirement should be limited to declaring only the 
alcohol content. 
Considering all the above, we respectfully request that the implementation of this modification 
regarding the inclusion of the “Alcohol Facts” panel be reconsidered, as it may not provide 
significant additional benefits to consumers and could, instead, lead to unintended confusion 
regarding the nature and nutritional value of alcoholic beverages and it must be limited to 
declaring only the alcohol content. Additionally, increasing regulatory and financial burdens on 
producers, in particular small and medium-sized ones. 
However, if the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel is approved, it is recommended that the 
information should be allowed to be presented through electronic labeling (QR code, digital platform, or 
website). This approach would facilitate access to information without imposing unnecessary regulatory 
or commercial burdens. 
This tool offers the following advantages: 
• Unlimited information space for consumers. 
• Provides consumers with more information in a user-friendly and easily understandable 
format.  
• Easily accommodates changes in regulatory provisions. 
• Allows information to reach one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent 
excessive and harmful alcohol use.  
 
The above is consistent with the "" Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food Information 
in Food Labelling”, which is being developed within the framework of the Codex Alimentarius Labeling 
Committee. 
Finally, if this requirement is implemented, a gradual implementation period of five years would be the 
best way to adopt such measures, allowing small producers to modify their supply chain for distribution 
in the U.S. 
For these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less 
burdensome solutions. 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Panambí Garcés 
General Manager

RIN 1513-AC93



Dear Reviewer,



Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed mandatory alcohol facts statement labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. I offer these comments as a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to specific requests for comment.



Title of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”

Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?

Are consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?

Alternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?



In many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts and dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to as “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is presented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the term “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol Facts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by seeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on a non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently providing alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. 



Mandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information

Should TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?

For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?

Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?

Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?

Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? 


Some aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include calories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily value for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars or other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to allow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for calories, fat, etc. 

I think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks cited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense balance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently giving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  

From personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving of alcohol and what constitutes a serving. Having alcohol facts available is useful in making choices to maintain healthy weights and consume responsibly. 

Calculating Panel Elements & Tolerance Levels

TTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still specific enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Specifically, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set.

TTB should be mindful of tolerances that are so exact that it would cause undue financial burden to small operations to comply with little benefit to public health. I agree with the approach TTB is proposing.

Mandatory Listing of Alcohol Content by volume on Malt Beverages

Should TTB require alcohol content statement on a beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act, but is subject to the IRC? 

Should TTB increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the statement amount for all malt beverage and beers? This would alleviate the need for expensive specialized equipment needed to test for alcohol content to a sufficient degree of certainty to meet the current tolerance standards. Would consumers receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance is increased? 

Should TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as the statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume?

Yes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements on beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act. Most consumers do not understand the regulatory distinction, so not seeing alcohol content on some products would be confusing and implementing the requirements “across the board” provides parity among producers. 

On the matter of increasing labeling tolerances, as long as the tolerance is backed with evidence that shows that consumers would not suffer harm if the alcohol content was one percentage point higher than what is stated on a product, I support the proposal. A proposal that would require purchase of expensive equipment to test alcohol content for certainty if there is no public health reason makes no sense and only serves to reduce competition in the marketplace. 

I agree with TTB’s proposal to require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages and a statement that adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume. 

Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of Alcohol Facts Statement

Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?



As a consumer, I do not feel strongly as to whether the alcohol content information is located on the Alcohol Facts statement or elsewhere on the label. However, I believe there should be a designated place where the information is required with options to provide it elsewhere (in addition) if a producer would like to include it as part of the label elsewhere. I think since the labels are changing so drastically, consumers should get used to finding important information in one spot on the container. By allowing the option to provide the information in more than one place, if producers have front of container labels that contain ABV, they would not need to redesign and reprint those labels in addition to having to comply with Alcohol Facts and/or allergen labeling requirements. 



Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving

TTB proposes to amend the regulations to require the listing of the number of U.S. fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, expressed to the nearest tenth of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume statement.

Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?

Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?

TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.

Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines' advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?

TTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and regulatory burdens.

The public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. 



Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

Linear Display

Though this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be reasonable for certain containers. 

Type Size

Unless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. 

Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

While it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important information to consumers. 

Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display

Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?

Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?

These are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have intended. 

Once again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of alcohol beverages.

of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the 
information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume 
statement.
2. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per 
serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers 
to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and 
health agencies, if they so choose?
3. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? 
Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or 
in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?
4. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms 
“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of 
those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.
5. Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of 
the Dietary Guidelines' advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any 
changes in the guidelines over time)?
6. TTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide 
useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and 
whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and 
regulatory burdens.
The public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that 
many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When 
thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an 
alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required 
information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with 
information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to 
consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers 
understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. 
Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information
A. Linear Display
Though this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be 
reasonable for certain containers. 
B. Type Size
Unless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility 
and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. 
C. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts InformationWhile it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory 
requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label 
does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I 
reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the 
state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We 
are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important 
information to consumers. 
Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display
1. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple 
servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?
2. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer 
servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five 
servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and 
labeled?
These are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels 
because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three 
or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric 
content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a 
case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a 
recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be 
more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention 
that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have 
intended. 
Once again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to 
provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of 
alcohol beverages.

Facts” Labeling Rule 
To: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
Re: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002 – Proposed Rule on Alcohol Facts Labeling 
I am writing to express my support for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s 
proposed rule to mandate an “Alcohol Facts” label on alcoholic beverage products. The proposed 
label would require the disclosure of per-serving alcohol content, calorie count, and nutrient 
information. This action is long overdue and urgently needed, as it represents an important step 
toward improving public health, enhancing consumer transparency, and encouraging more 
informed and responsible alcoholic consumption. I respectfully urge the TTB to adopt this rule 
and to maintain the proposed five-year compliance period as it is both practical and reasonable 
for industry application. 
There are several compelling reasons as to why mandatory alcohol facts labeling should be 
implemented. 
1. Enhancing Consumer Protection by Implementing Beverage Transparency  
One of the most important public health justifications for this rule is the urgent 
need for transparency regarding the composition and nutrition of alcoholic beverages. 
Unlike packages foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
alcoholic beverages regulated by the TTB are not currently required to include nutrition 
labels. While the reasoning for this stems from decisions made in the 1930s, these 
policies are outdated and no longer align with modern consumer expectations or health 
priorities.1  
The absence of transparency means that consumers continue to be unaware of 
ingredients that could pose health risks, especially for those with allergies and dietary 
restrictions. Many people are unaware that alcoholic beverages can contain sulfites, 
artificial colors, sweeteners, preservatives, or grains that may cause adverse reactions.2 A 
product that was once safe to consume may change formulations without the consumer’s 
knowledge. This lack of labeling creates unnecessary risk for individuals with food 
sensitivities or health conditions. While this proposed rule does not address allergen 
disclosure, like that of Docket No. TTB-2025-0003,3 it lays the foundation for consumer 
transparency among alcoholic beverages. Additionally, this rule supports health equity by

distilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages. making it easier for people with chronic conditions and dietary needs to make safe and 
informed choices.  
2. Promoting Nutritional Awareness 
Alcoholic beverages are a significant source of “hidden” calories. Without 
labeling, many individuals unknowingly exceed their recommended daily intake for 
calories or sugar through alcohol consumption alone. For example, a 1.5 ounce shot of 
hard liquor contains anywhere from 100 to 120 calories and that is before any mixers are 
added.4  
Requiring calorie and nutrient content labeling would encourage consumers to 
better track their intake and make more intentional decisions that correspond to their 
health goals. In a society that is increasingly focused on improving their health and 
preventing disease, transparency among consumed alcohol is essential. Emerging studies 
have revealed an association between alcohol consumption and obesity.5 Thus, 
transparency in labeling can contribute to nutritional awareness among consumers and 
support more conscious drinking habits. 
3. Reducing Risky Consumption and Binge Drinking Through Informed Choices 
Transparent alcohol labeling also plays a critical role in preventing 
overconsumption and binge drinking. According to the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), binge drinking is defined as consuming five or more 
drinks for males or four or more for females within a two-hour period.6 However, without 
clear labeling of alcohol content and serving size, many individuals underestimate the 
amount of alcohol within a beverage, particularly with ready to drink cocktails or 
oversized containers. 
Studies have shown that alcohol labeling can influence drinking behavior and 
reduce the intentions to drink alcohol.7 More accurate labeling could encourage 
moderation and promote responsible drinking habits, especially among casual drinkers or 
younger consumers who may not be aware of the recommended limits. By implementing 
a label, consumers would be able to gauge how much they are actually consuming, which 
could potentially reduce binge drinking. 
The proposed alcohol facts labeling rule is a critical step towards improving consumer 
transparency, health equity, and public safety. This change would bring the labeling standard of 
alcoholic beverages to that of the same caliber of the labeling for food and non-alcoholic 
beverages, thus allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding their health. This rule 
also fosters accountability and transparency. Additionally, the proposed five-year compliance

public health measure.

I started my winery in Massachusetts in 2020 and have been growing and producing quality aged wines for 5 years. I generally support the proposed regulation for listing ingredients on wine labels. However, there seems to be a major piece missing. I would like to bring to your attention the consequence of the proposed mandate implementation period of 5 years, and its impact in existing inventories. I've read this proposal three times and I have not read any scope on how this proposal will be applied to existing inventories. There is little or no mention of its applicability to existing inventories and library wines. As anyone knows, wines and wine inventories are typically aged over multiple years before release. My question is how will my existing COLA-approved and labeled inventories will be affected. My wine business depends on ageing our wines at various timeframes. We offer library wines that may be aged from 2 to 10 years, and beyond. These existing inventories have been labeled and are aging for an indefinite period in our cellar, and we offer these on occasion as vertical tasting products to our club members. Since our labels are permeant as required by TTB, it would be unfeasible to uncork and rebottle only to adhere to the proposed label changes. It would put our product at great risk of spoilage. We ask if the agency anticipated this impact and its unintended consequences, and to consider our proposed recommendation for resolution. Our Recommendation We are asking TTB add to the proposed regulation a clause that mentions that all existing inventories are retroactively exempt if they were bottled and labeled under the previous version (or the current existing version) of the regulation. This would allow industry members to avoid unnecessary cost and potential destruction of highly valuable library wines. Conclusion.

USA - Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
 
Notice of proposed rulemaking: Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (“BNIC”) is a private institution financed by the Cognac 
professionals (producers and trade houses) and entrusted with public service missions. The objectives of 
BNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all 
Cognac stakeholders overall. 
 
On 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in 
the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring the disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, 
and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to 
TTB’s regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.  
 
On TTB’s request for comments regarding the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” 
(both are currently being considered by the TTB): 
BNIC is favorable for the use of the title “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”. Indeed, the 
information included in the proposal refers to nutritional information in a serving of an alcoholic beverage 
which will be specific to the beverage in quest ion, rather than information on alcohol. Therefore, the title 
“Alcohol Facts” could be misleading or a cause of confusion for consumers.  
 
On TTB’s display proposals: 
Labeling space is limited and in efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of labeling (printing, use of ink etc.) 
it is desirable to limit the information which is printed out. Therefore,   
- BNIC s trongly u rges the TTB to authorize the use of digital means to display the nutritional 
statement. Authorizing the use of digital tools would present many advantages. Firstly, this would 
save space on the label itself, reducing the use of paper, glue and ink to print the labels. Secondly, 
it would allow industry members to share further information with consumers about the product, 
i.e. the production process, list of ingredients, health and responsible consumption guidelines,

packaging collection and sorting details and sustainability information. Digital tools such as QR 
codes also allow for the information to be easily shared in different languages, allowing a greater 
number of consumers to understand and have readily access to information on the product. Finally, 
digital tools also for easy updates, low compliance costs and avoid label waste which allows 
businesses to update their labels with minimal cost incurred. In the European Union, the wine 
industry must only include the number of calories per 100ml on the bottle, with further information 
such as energy values and the list of ingredients being readily available via a QR Code in all 24 
official languages of the European Union. This is very important for the alcoholic beverages sector 
which is made up of largely exported products.   
- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly urges the TTB to remove the black box around the 
declaration which will unnecessarily use up space on the label. Removing the black box will allow 
industry members more flexibility on the presentation of the required information.  
- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly u rges the TTB to authorize a linear display on all 
bottles, regardless of their content. A linear display, rather than a columned table display, will allow 
industry members to save space on their labels and offer them more flexibility in the declaration 
presentation.   
 
On TTB’s proposal regarding the information to be included in the declaration:  
- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to allow sugar content statements to remain as an optional 
element. This flexibility will allow industry members the possibility to align as much as possible 
with international practices regarding this matter. For example, in E urope, many spirit industry 
members voluntarily disclose additional nutritional information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, 
protein and salt.  
- BNIC asks for the removal of the Alcohol by volume from the declaration. Firstly, the alcohol by 
volume percentage is already presented on the front label, in the same field of vision as the 
Commercial name and the Legal name of the product. Repeating the alcohol by volume percentage 
will not share any further information with the consumer as this information is already easily 
available on the front label. However, it would take up more room unnecessarily for industry 
members.  
- BNIC would like to inform TTB that the expression of alcohol in fluid ounces may lead to 
confusion among consumers. Fluid ounces are not commonly used in other countries, particularly 
foreign speaking countries. We therefore recommend the option of using international standards 
such as ml or cl. 
- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to not align the declaration on distilled spirits with the FDA 
Nutrition Facts label. The inclusion of such information is unnecessary due to the differences 
between alcohol beverages and other foods, Cognac for example does not contain sodium.  
 
On TTB’s proposal regarding serving sizes:

T : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr 
- BNIC recommends avoiding the use of nutritional information for the whole bottle as this could 
lead to consumer confusion who may believe the information relates to a serving size rather than 
the whole bottle.  
- BNIC would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes. Serving sizes may 
vary between different countries and may also differ depending on the specificity of the product. 
For example, a typical serving size in France for a distilled spirit would be 30ml.  
 
On TTB’s proposal to permit a 20% tolerance above or below the labeled amount for calories, 
carbohydrates, protein and fat: 
BNIC kindly welcomes and supports this proposal. Indeed, BNIC and Cognac industry members have 
calculated average nutritional values for Cognac with an ABV of 40%. TTB’s current proposal would allow 
for this average nutritional value to be used by our industry members and facilitate small and medium-sized 
businesses in implementing the new rule.  
 
On TTB’s proposed exclusion of requesting a new COLA request: 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This 
will largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized 
businesses.  
 
On TTB’s proposed transition period:  
- BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic 
climate for our industry, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for industry members.  
- BNIC would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was 
put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. As a premium product, Cognac stock 
turnover can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits, especially during the 
current particularly difficult economic conjuncture of industry.  
- BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238 : Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  is adopted, that its entry into 
force is aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.

While I support initiatives that promote informed consumer choices, I am apprehensive about the economic and operational challenges this requirement may impose on Georgia's wine industry, particularly for small and family-owned wineries. Economic Impact on Georgia's Wine Industry Georgia's wine industry significantly contributes to the state's economy, supporting local agriculture, creating jobs, and attracting tourism. The proposed labeling changes would necessitate comprehensive label redesigns, leading to increased production costs. For small wineries operating with limited budgets, these additional expenses could be financially burdensome, potentially resulting in higher product prices for consumers and reduced competitiveness in the market. Is more regulation really needed to help support this growing industry or harm it? I am a believer that allowing free market forces without tight regulation provides the best platform for successful businesses and communities. Should the government instead focus on the root cause of allergies or other chronic illnesses instead of regulating small businesses that are under constant attacks? We, as producers, assume all the risks of the products we produce and are therefore naturally incentivized to produce a non-harmful products. The more red tape, hoops to jump through, and restrictions create less growth. Conversely, shrinking government overreach allows consumers and producers to do business freely allowing for a mutually beneficial relationship. Operational Challenges Implementing the ""Alcohol Facts"" labeling would require wineries to conduct detailed analyses of their products to determine accurate nutritional content. This process involves laboratory testing and compliance verification, demanding both time and financial resources. Small wineries may find it particularly challenging to absorb these costs without compromising other critical aspects of their operations. Alternative Approaches for Consumer Education While understanding the health implications of alcohol consumption is essential, there are alternative methods to educate consumers without imposing stringent labeling requirements. Public health campaigns and digital platforms can effectively disseminate information about responsible drinking and health risks associated with alcohol. These approaches can reach a broad audience without adversely affecting the economic stability of local wineries. A blanket statement regarding the number of alcoholic drinks recommended per person is flawed as everybody is different. Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks consumed.

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

As the proprietor of Georgia Winery, | am writing to express my concerns regarding the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and
Notice No. 238, which would mandate the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” statements on wine
labels. While | support initiatives that promote informed consumer choices, | am
apprehensive about the economic and operational challenges this requirement may impose
on Georgia’s wine indugtry, particularly for small and family-owned wineries.

Economic Impact on Georgia’s Wine Industry

Georgia’s wine industry significantly contributes to the state’s economy, supporting local
agriculture, creating jobs, and attracting tourism. The proposed labeling changes would
necessitate comprehensive label redesigns, leading to increased production costs. For
small wineries operating with limited budgets, these additional expenses could be financially
burdensome, potentially resulting in higher product prices for consumers and reduced
competitiveness in the market.

Is more regulation really needed to help support this growing industry or harm it? | ama
believer that allowing free market forces without tight regulation provides the best platform
for successful businesses and communities. Should the government instead focus on the
root cause of allergies or other chronic illnesses instead of regulating small businesses that
are under constant attacks? We, as producers, assume all the risks of the products we
produce and are therefore naturally incentivized to produce a non-harmful products. The
more red tape, hoops to jump through, and restrictions create less growth. Conversely,
shrinking government overreach allows consumers and producers to do business freely
allowing for a mutually beneficial relationship.

Operational Challenges

Implementing the “Alcohol Facts” labeling would require wineries to conduct detailed
analyses of their products to determine accurate nutritional content. This process involves
laboratory testing and compliance verification, demanding both time and financial
resources. Small wineries may find it particularly challenging to absorb these costs without
compromising other critical aspects of their operations.

Alternative Approaches for Consumer Education

While understanding the heaith implications of alcohol consumption is essential, there are
alternative methods to educate consumers without imposing stringent labeling
requirements. Public health campaigns and digital platforms can effectively disseminate
information about responsible drinking and health risks associated with alcohol. These
approaches can reach a broad audience without adversely affecting the economic stability
of local wineries.
A blanket statement regarding the number of alcoholic drinks recommended per person is
flawed as everybody is different. Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it
does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks
consumed.

Conclusion

| urge you to consider the potential economic and operational impacts of the proposed
labeling requirements on Georgia’s wine industry. By exploring alternative strategies for
consumer education, we can achieve the goal of informed decision-making without placing
undue burdens on small businesses that are vital to our state’s economy and cultural
heritage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. | am committed to promoting responsible
consumption and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that educate
consumers while supporting the sustainability of the wine industry.

Comments on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237, RIN 1513-AC93  I appreciate the opportunity to offer my individual comments on the proposed rule regarding Alcohol Facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The intent and purpose of this rule are commendable, as it aims to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the alcohol content and nutritional value of these beverages. Such transparency is crucial for informed consumer choices and aligns with public health objectives. The general outline of the proposed rule is a significant step forward in enhancing label clarity and consumer awareness. However, I would like to offer a few specific comments and suggestions to further improve its implementation, effectiveness and fairness. Linear Display I believe that a linear display of the required information should not only be allowable but actually preferable. It is more cost-effective, efficient, informs consumers sufficiently, and requires less label real estate. Additionally, a linear display is less disruptive to the label's overall design, and avoids impairing the seller’s branding and presentation. Compliance Timeline I propose extending the compliance timeline to six years. Considering the industry standard of a five-year label turnover, a six-year period would better align with this cycle, significantly reducing the regulatory burden. This extension would enable producers to comply without incurring unnecessary costs or causing undue harm to the marketplace and consumers. Given the lengthy development of this rule, an abrupt compliance period shorter than the industry's label turnover timeframe would be impractical and ill-advised.    2 
Categorization of Hard Ciders The rule would benefit from including a separate categorization of hard ciders due to their unique characteristics, rather than jamming them into a non-germane category. Hard ciders differ from other alcoholic beverages in alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. Alcohol Content: Hard ciders vary significantly in alcohol content, from low-alcohol variants to levels comparable to wine or beer. Clear guidelines based on alcohol content would help consumers make informed choices and enable producers to comply with specific requirements. Packaging Sizes: Hard ciders come in various packaging sizes, requiring different labeling considerations. A separate categorization would allow for tailored labeling requirements to accommodate diverse packaging options. Fermentation Variability: The fermentation process for hard ciders differs from that of other alcoholic beverages. Factors like apple type, fermentation duration, and additional ingredients impact the final product. Regulations that account for these variabilities would ensure consumers receive accurate product information. Nutritional Profiles: Hard ciders have distinct nutritional profiles, with varying levels of sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients. A separate categorization would allow for more accurate labeling, ensuring consumers understand the nutritional content. Therefore, I recommend that TTB establish a distinct category for hard ciders within the regulatory framework. One way to do this is by creating specific guidelines that address the unique aspects of hard ciders, including their alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. This approach would improve clarity and compliance, benefiting both consumers and producers. Lessened Requirements for 50 ml Minibottles I recommend lessened requirements for 50 ml minibottles of hard liquor/spirits due to the significant challenges posed by limited labeling space. Prioritizing essential information ensures readability and design integrity. Since minibottles are often sold in sets with comprehensive outer packaging, extensive individual labeling is unnecessary. Their small portion size presents a lower risk, justifying less stringent requirements. Lessened compliance for minibottles benefits consumers by keeping  3 
labels uncluttered and clear, streamlining regulatory processes, and reducing the burden on producers, especially small businesses.  I recommend implementing guidelines for minibottles that specify minimum required information, such as alcohol content and a general warning, to maintain essential disclosures while allowing flexibility. Other Issues § 7.63 Mandatory Label Information ""Mandatory label information"" should be capitalized for consistency with other section titles: ""Mandatory Label Information."" Examples in Figures In the linear display example for distilled spirits (§ 5.212): ""Serving Size 1.7 fl oz (50 mL)"" should read ""Serving Size 1.5 fl oz (44 mL)"" to maintain consistency with other serving sizes. Rounding Rules The rules for rounding percentages and numerical values (such as alcohol content and nutritional information) should be explicitly stated to ensure consistency. For instance, specifying how to handle rounding for values like 14.95% alcohol by volume would provide clarity and avoid discrepancies. I suggest stating: ""All percentages and numerical values should be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percent (0.1%) for clarity and consistency."" Optional Information The conditions for including optional information, such as additional statements of alcohol content or total sugars, should be clearly defined. This clarity would help prevent inconsistent labeling practices and ensure uniform presentation of all necessary information.    4 
Labeling for Small Containers The labeling requirements for very small containers, where space is limited, need clarification. Specifying minimum font sizes and prioritizing information can help producers comply without compromising readability.  I suggest: “For containers smaller than 50 ml, the minimum font size for mandatory information should be 1.0 mm. Priority should be given to listing alcohol content, serving size, and allergens.” Definitions of Terms Terms like ""non-alcoholic,"" ""alcohol free,"" and ""low alcohol"" might be interpreted differently by consumers. Providing clear definitions and consistent usage in the regulations would help prevent ambiguity and ensure consumer understanding. One way to do this would be: ""Non-alcoholic: Contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Alcohol free: Contains 0.0% alcohol by volume. Low alcohol: Contains less than 1.2% alcohol by volume."" Scope of Mandatory Information Clarify what is considered mandatory versus optional information within the Alcohol Facts statement to avoid confusion. Clear distinctions between mandatory and optional information will help ensure consistent labeling practices across the industry. I suggest: ""Mandatory information includes alcohol content, serving size, and nutrient information. Optional information may include additional health claims or ingredient details, provided they are accurately labeled as optional."" Product Variability The rule should address products with variable compositions, such as cocktails with different fruit content that may absorb spirits. Providing guidance on labeling these products will help ensure consumers receive accurate information about their beverages.   5 
A suggested guideline could be: “Products with variable compositions should list average alcohol content and nutrient information based on standard recipes. Any significant variations should be noted in the labeling to inform consumers.” Compliance Date and Small Businesses TTB asked:  Does the proposed compliance date suffice to limit the negative impact on small businesses and reduce overall costs of compliance while ensuring that consumers receive adequate information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the alcohol beverage products they are purchasing and consuming? In my view, the costs of label compliance are substantial, especially for smaller producers. Much of this cost could be avoided by setting the compliance timeframe slightly longer than the average industry label turnover, which is approximately five years. Therefore, I recommend a six-year compliance timeframe. This period would apply to both small and large producers, allowing them to comply earlier on a voluntary basis, while the mandatory requirement would only take effect after six years. This approach would be economically efficient and impose less regulatory burden. Benefits of Alcohol Content Statements TTB asked:  What are the potential benefits to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? I believe that alcohol content expressed as a percentage by volume has been familiar and useful for consumers for years. It provides a clear and straightforward measure that helps consumers make informed decisions. This approach avoids many of the complications associated with alcohol quantity, serving sizes, and package sizes. Therefore, I support requiring alcohol content percentage on all beverages. Alcohol Content Tolerances TTB asked:  Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers? If so, does the same argument apply to wines, which currently have a 1.5 percentage point tolerance for wines up to 14 percent alcohol by volume, and a 1 percentage point tolerance for wines with an alcohol content of over 14 percent alcohol by volume?  6 
In my experience, consumers do not focus on decimal points and fractions. A reasonable tolerance level is acceptable for consumers, as they do not require precise laboratory measurements. Aligning the tolerance for malt beverages with that for wines should be adequate. Broader tolerances accommodate natural product variations and reduce the need for frequent batch testing for alcohol content. Labeling for Non-Alcoholic Malt Beverages TTB asked:  Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume? Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements? It seems evident that non-alcoholic malt beverages absolutely must have a label disclosing that they contain small (or trace) amounts of alcohol. This is important for individuals who avoid alcohol for religious, dietary, medical, or legal reasons. If these beverages are already subject to labeling requirements from other agencies, TTB need not impose further labeling. However, if there is an oversight gap, TTB should ensure proper labeling. Alcohol Content Range for Table Wines TTB asked:  Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers? It seems to me that to reduce the disproportionate burden on small wineries and importers, they should be allowed to indicate alcohol content as a range for table wines. This approach would provide sufficient information to consumers while relieving some of the regulatory burden. Allowing a range would be consistent with the reasons discussed in the NPRM and would not unfairly penalize consumers by depriving them of important information. Dietary Guidelines on Moderate Drinking TTB asked:  Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?  7 
My thoughts are that including dietary advice on moderate drinking has no place on these labels. The purpose of the labels is to disclose the contents of the beverage container to consumers, not to provide general education on drinking habits. Such information does not add to the purchasing decision process and is outside the scope of the rule. While it may be useful in some contexts, it is not appropriate for product labeling.  Thank you for considering my comments. I hope they provide valuable insights and contribute to the successful finalization of the Alcohol Facts labeling regulations.

By providing an easily understandable serving size of &lsquo;standard drink(s)&rsquo; that will match up with public awareness campaigns, we will be able to save lives by preventing excessive alcohol consumption and its harms for both drinkers and non-drinkers alike.<br/>",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,approval,0.5174971222877502,"{'admiration': 0.011850319802761078, 'amusement': 0.0001596400688868016, 'anger': 0.000643160252366215, 'annoyance': 0.004215131048113108, 'approval': 0.5174971222877502, 'caring': 0.015301020815968513, 'confusion': 0.0008895151549950242, 'curiosity': 0.0006061933236196637, 'desire': 0.023953653872013092, 'disappointment': 0.004914791788905859, 'disapproval': 0.00784325785934925, 'disgust': 0.001026769750751555, 'embarrassment': 0.00025915747391991317, 'excitement': 0.0006830365746282041, 'fear': 0.0012436266988515854, 'gratitude': 0.0012134419521316886, 'grief': 0.0004703251470346004, 'joy': 0.0004893224686384201, 'love': 0.0015825001755729318, 'nervousness': 0.0006093838019296527, 'optimism': 0.07904999703168869, 'pride': 0.0011454041814431548, 'realization': 0.019357269629836082, 'relief': 0.0015354895731434226, 'remorse': 0.0006570787518285215, 'sadness': 0.0027557602152228355, 'surprise': 0.00023088256421033293, 'neutral': 0.299816757440567}"

Supporting Evidence: Studies show that clear labeling reduces accidental allergen exposure and improves public health outcomes. (Turner et al., Clinical & Experimental Allergy, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13970) On Health Warnings and Risk Communication Comment: Health warnings should be made more prominent, use plain language, and reflect up-to-date science, including risks related to pregnancy, cancer, mental health, and impaired driving. Consideration should also be given to rotating warning messages to increase public awareness. Supporting Evidence: Rotating and graphic health warnings on alcohol are associated with increased risk perception and reduced harmful use. (Noel et al., Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, 2023, https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.2023.84.236) On Digital Submission and Accessibility Comment: The proposed expansion of digital and electronic submissions is welcome, but TTB should ensure all forms and submission portals are fully accessible to people with disabilities and available in multiple languages, including Spanish, to promote equitable access. Supporting Evidence: Digital inclusion is vital for regulatory compliance and fairness, especially for small producers and those with limited English proficiency. (Pew Research Center, 2021, https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/06/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-americans-with-lower-incomes-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/) On Environmental and Social Sustainability Claims Comment: Clarify standards for labeling or advertising environmental or social sustainability claims (e.g., organic, carbon-neutral, fair trade) to prevent greenwashing and support truthful, substantiated claims that advance climate action and social equity. Supporting Evidence: Clear, enforceable standards for eco-labels build consumer trust and incentivize responsible practices. (Potts et al., International Institute for Sustainable Development, 2022, https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/standards-and-labelling-sustainability) On Racial and Gender Equity in Label Representation Comment: The rule should promote inclusive label imagery and discourage stereotypes, encouraging the industry to consider diverse representation in marketing, which research links to positive social impact and equity. Supporting Evidence: Inclusive advertising is linked to greater market access and social change. (American Marketing Association, 2022, https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/inclusive-marketing-benefits/) On Burden Minimization and Support for Small Producers Comment: TTB should offer technical assistance, plain-language guidance, and fee waivers for small, minority-owned, or rural producers, helping them comply without undue financial or administrative burden. Supporting Evidence: Targeted support improves compliance and equity among small businesses. (SBA Office of Advocacy, 2023, https://advocacy.sba.gov/2023/01/17/small-business-access-to-regulatory-information/) On Data Collection for Health and Equity Monitoring Comment: Require industry reporting of anonymized production, distribution, and labeling data, disaggregated by region and producer type, to support public health research, address inequities, and monitor the effectiveness of labeling policies. Supporting Evidence: Disaggregated regulatory data strengthens oversight and targeted intervention. (CDC, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm) On Cross-Border Consistency and Global Best Practices Comment: Harmonize labeling requirements with World Health Organization and Codex Alimentarius standards where possible, to facilitate trade, improve public health, and maintain U.S. leadership in evidence-based alcohol regulation. Supporting Evidence: International alignment improves regulatory efficacy and market efficiency. (WHO Global Alcohol Strategy, 2018) On Consumer Education and Public Engagement Comment: Accompany regulatory changes with a robust public education campaign and multilingual resources, ensuring that all communities, especially historically underserved groups, understand new label content and health implications. Supporting Evidence: Education campaigns enhance the impact of labeling and reduce disparities in knowledge. (Babor et al., The Lancet, 2022) On Process for Ongoing Review and Update Comment: Establish a process for periodic, evidence-based review and updating of labeling and advertising regulations, with ongoing public input to ensure responsiveness to emerging science and social needs. (Speculative) Supporting Evidence: Regulatory agility is essential as new evidence and social norms evolve.
