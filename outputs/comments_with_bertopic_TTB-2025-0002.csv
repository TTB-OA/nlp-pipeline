Japan’s Comment on the “G/TBT/N/USA/2182” 
 
Japan appreciates that the United States of America provided WTO members the 
opportunity to comment on 27 CFR Part 4, 5, 7, 24, 25 and 27 by notifying the 
“G/TBT/N/USA/2182”.  
 
The proposed mandatory labeling of Alcohol Facts could impose a significant burden 
on small businesses such as liquor manufacturers and importers. In order to reduce 
the burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to prevent any 
problems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following requests: 
 
[Comment 1] 
Regarding nutrient labeling requirements, we would like nutrients to be listed only if 
mentioned nutrients are present at a certain level or higher. In the case of alcoholic 
beverages, most products do not contain, or contain only a de minimis amount of, 
fat and protein. We believe that it should not be mandatory to label substances that 
are not present or that are present only a small amount in a product. 
 
[Comment 2] 
TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule is 
published in the Federal Register. As it is necessary to ensure that businesses have 
sufficient time to prepare for making changes to labels of their products, we request 
that the proposed 5-year period be maintained, and not be shortened. 
 
[Comment 3] 
Given that label space is limited, in order to reduce  the burden on businesses we 
would like it to be possible to provide Alcohol Facts through electronic  means such 
as QR codes. By allowing the use of electronic means, we believe that businesses 
will find it easier to accommodate different languages and to update information, 
thereby reducing the burden of displaying Alcohol Facts. If this request is not granted, 
this will become a trade barrier. 
 
[Comment 4] 
Although the proposal does not make analytical testing mandatory, nevertheless we 
would like the TTB website to clearly state proper analytical testing methods for each 
nutrient for reference. When we examined TTB website, w e found we were unable 
to confirm the contents of the Official TTB method described in the TTB Procedures 
2020-1, and we were also unable to access the AOAC method for free. It would be  
 
2 
 
much appreciated if a document containing all of  the information necessary for 
analysis would be made publicly available free of charge, for reference. We also ask 
that the proposed tolerance of 20 percent, either above or below the stated amount 
of calorie, carbohydrate, protein and fat, not be altered. 
 
We would also like the U.S. to answer the following questions: 
 
[Question 1] 
Regarding the serving size, given that a serving size  for sake i s not explicitly 
mentioned in the proposal, do you anticipate that sake will use the reference amount 
for wine? 
 
[Question 2] 
The proposal allows b usinesses to rely on  published databases rather than on 
analytical testing. Would it be acceptable to quote and use databases published by 
any organization in any country? If you expect any specific published databases to 
be referenced, we would appreciate it if you could share that information with us.

Re: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau - Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Bessent, 
On behalf of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a national health no-profit organization, I write 
today to call your attention to the negative health effects of alcohol and to ask you to inform consumers by 
moving forward with the proposed alcohol labeling rule. These labels will help fulfill the administration’s goals of 
preventing and reducing chronic disease. 
The “First Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health” was issued in 1971, but even by that time 
the health risks of consuming alcohol had already been well documented.1 As the evidence on alcohol’s health 
risks continues to mount, our organization recommends the current warning label on alcoholic beverages, which 
first appeared in 1989, be updated to better protect Americans by listing specific health risks, as well as nutrition 
and allergen information. 
The label, which has not been updated in more than 35 years, currently reads: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) 
According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the 
risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate 
machinery and may cause health problems.”2 
Using the vague term “health problems” leaves Americans unaware of the true toll alcohol consumption can have 
on health, including a growing understanding of how it raises the risk of several types of cancer. It is vital that this 
label be updated to reflect the increased evidence and understanding of the specific risks of alcohol consumption. 
In January 2025, the Surgeon General released “Alcohol and Cancer Risk,” an advisory report that cites scientific 
evidence on the link between alcohol consumption and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, 
including breast (in women), colorectum, esophagus, laryngeal, liver, mouth, and throat.3 The report recommends 
that the existing Surgeon General’s health warning label on alcohol-containing beverages be updated to include a 
warning about the risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption. Our organization, which has 17,000 doctor 
members, already recommends avoiding alcohol as part of our Let’s Beat Breast Cancer campaign, which 
provides healthcare providers and the public with evidence-based resources and powerful steps to reduce breast 
cancer risk.4 This campaign echoes the recently passed policies of the American Medical Association, which 
support not only clearer alcohol labelling but also efforts to educate the public about the benefits of lifestyle 
changes that may reduce breast cancer risk, including limiting alcohol intake, regular physical activity, 
maintenance of a healthy body weight, and a healthy plant-based diet.5 This policy also encourages physicians to 
regularly discuss with their individual patients the benefits of lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk.  In addition to adding a cancer warning, we recommend that the label also address other health risks to the liver, 
brain, gut, pancreas, lungs, cardiovascular system, immune system, and other parts of the body, as detailed by the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.6  
Ingredient information should also be included for those looking to avoid allergens—such as sulfites and grains 
like wheat, rye, or barley—or animal products that are sometimes used as flavoring or fining agents, which are 
used to filter out impurities and improve the clarity of some alcoholic beverages. 7 Common animal-based fining 
agents include milk byproducts including whey, casein, and lactose. Other ingredients commonly found in 
alcoholic beverages include eggs; isinglass, which is derived from fish bladders; and gelatin, which is derived 
from animal skin, bones, and cartilage.8 Consumers who wish to avoid consumption of these ingredients, whether 
for health or other reasons, should have access to this information. 
Updated warning labels on alcohol are long overdue and should reflect current knowledge about the health risks 
of alcohol, as well as allergen and ingredient information that will help Americans make well-informed decisions. 
Thank you for your attention to this important issue. 
 
Sincerely,

Comment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) 
VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION 
Dear Administrator Ryan:  
Consumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important 
rulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and 
MajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to 
strengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in 
grams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the 
format and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how 
this rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and 
to urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the 
basic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other 
beverages and food. 
Leading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol 
labeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates 
alcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers 
what’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with 
cheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, 
Calley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full 
transparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 
CFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol 
labeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the 
available evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have 
documented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that

4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but 
significant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  
Similarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard 
drinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate 
their alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that 
do not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more 
conscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of 
alcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related 
harms.7  
These spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to 
consumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for 
Surgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third 
biggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can 
increase the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public 
awareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate 
drinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating 
the health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage 
Labeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that 
worthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its 
pledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  
There is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see 
on the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism 
can end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.  
Sincerely,  
  
Thomas Gremillion

**Subject: Public Health Perspective on Proposed Changes to Distilled Spirits Standards**

Dear TTB,

As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 237. I urge the TTB to consider the broader implications of expanding definitions and permitted ingredients for distilled spirits. While regulatory modernization is important for industry innovation, public health protection must remain paramount.

Widening the standards of identity—particularly allowing for a broader range of flavorings, additives, and processing techniques—risks further obscuring the true content of alcohol products from consumers. Transparency and clarity are essential for consumers to make informed decisions about their health. If new ingredients or processes are allowed, there must be strict labeling and disclosure requirements to ensure that consumers are not misled or unknowingly exposed to compounds that could pose health risks.

Moreover, the normalization or rebranding of certain spirits under broader standards may appeal to younger or more vulnerable populations. The TTB should take into account the potential for increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including addiction, liver disease, and alcohol-related injuries.

Public health considerations should be integrated into any final rule. I respectfully recommend TTB:

* Require mandatory ingredient disclosure on labels for all spirits.
* Conduct or require pre-market safety reviews for novel additives.
* Assess the public health implications of marketing changes enabled by revised standards.

Thank you for considering my perspective.

Sincerely,

Standards of Identity
Subject: Public Health Perspective on Proposed Changes to Distilled Spirits 
Standards
Dear TTB,
As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 237. 
I urge the TTB to consider the broader implications of expanding definitions and 
permitted ingredients for distilled spirits. While regulatory modernization is important for 
industry innovation, public health protection must remain paramount.
Widening the standards of identity—particularly allowing for a broader range of 
flavorings, additives, and processing techniques—risks further obscuring the true 
content of alcohol products from consumers. Transparency and clarity are essential for 
consumers to make informed decisions about their health. If new ingredients or 
processes are allowed, there must be strict labeling and disclosure requirements to 
ensure that consumers are not misled or unknowingly exposed to compounds that could 
pose health risks.
Moreover, the normalization or rebranding of certain spirits under broader standards 
may appeal to younger or more vulnerable populations. The TTB should take into 
account the potential for increased alcohol consumption and related harms, including 
addiction, liver disease, and alcohol-related injuries.
Public health considerations should be integrated into any final rule. I respectfully 
recommend TTB:
•Require mandatory ingredient disclosure on labels for all spirits.
•Conduct or require pre-market safety reviews for novel additives.
•Assess the public health implications of marketing changes enabled by revised 
standards.
Thank you for considering my perspective.
Sincerely,
Cassandra Tourre",0,3,"[3, -1, -1]",3,-1,-1,gratitude,0.8699983954429626,"{'admiration': 0.025170130655169487, 'amusement': 0.00011774320591939613, 'anger': 0.0002665647189132869, 'annoyance': 0.0016363193280994892, 'approval': 0.044658347964286804, 'caring': 0.007563861086964607, 'confusion': 0.00039137585554271936, 'curiosity': 0.00028449748060666025, 'desire': 0.0020519618410617113, 'disappointment': 0.0005065678851678967, 'disapproval': 0.002897858852520585, 'disgust': 0.0003636835317593068, 'embarrassment': 0.00012324092676863074, 'excitement': 0.0003801181446760893, 'fear': 0.00018729949078988284, 'gratitude': 0.8699983954429626, 'grief': 0.0001355501590296626, 'joy': 0.0002904611174017191, 'love': 0.00045566659537144005, 'nervousness': 7.345309859374538e-05, 'optimism': 0.005100717768073082, 'pride': 0.0005824440740980208, 'realization': 0.0022876951843500137, 'relief': 0.0008321060449816287, 'remorse': 0.0004210406623315066, 'sadness': 0.00036335730692371726, 'surprise': 0.00010650590411387384, 'neutral': 0.03275294229388237}"

This letter presents comments of the National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB)' on the Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
(TTB) Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed rules cited above. NFIB finds it
hard to understand why the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management
and Budget continue to pursue these Biden Administration proposals that would place
heavy and unwarranted burdens on the small businesses of America in the beer, wine,
and spirits industry. NFIB recommends and requests that the Treasury Department
withdraw both Biden proposals.

protects and advances the ability of Americans to own, operate, and grow their businesses and ensures
that governments of the United States and the fifty states hear the voice of small business as they

1. The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses
That Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust

Census Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that
small businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the
beer, wine, and spirits industry:

Line of Number of Firms That Had

Business Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage
Breweries 3,214 2,609 81%
Wineries 3,576 2,975 83%
Distilleries 760 659 86%

In the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and
Spirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than
6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.
The report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the
number of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has

grown dramatically but still occupies only a small share of the market.’ Thus, the
Government's own data makes clear that, when the Treasury Department aims new
labeling requirements at the beer, wine, and spirits industry, it hits primarily small
businesses.5 The two Biden-proposed rules fail to recognize the practicalities of
running small businesses and fail to make the adjustments for small businesses that the
congressional policy stated in the Regulatory Flexibility Act contemplates.®

Small businesses, unlike the corporate behemoths in the beer, wine, and spirits industry
whose names and fortunes most everyone knows, cannot afford the bevy of lawyers
and experts necessary to decipher the rules and physically implement them, let alone
afford the cost of changes in processing and machinery to accommodate them.
Regulatory compliance costs small business owners time and money, both of which are
generally in short supply as they strive to keep their small businesses going, meet their
customers’ needs, and create jobs. The Biden-proposed rules would impose
unaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive
barrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in
the industry who can.

The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
fail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared
that “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities
has in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,

Rule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at

§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,
sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,
differing views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,
moral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these
questions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and
spirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound
science and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.
NFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits
have available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage
environments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out
to Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-
alcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the
guidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at
https:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-

discouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress
also noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated
businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to
inefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some
cases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental
and economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules
simply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately
dismisses it.®

President Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the
country’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:

My Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built
on common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators
first. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade
practices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°

To help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting
red tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

2. TTB Did Not Get the President's Deregula’ Message

President Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they
should seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.

On January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days
after TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule
and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order
14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The
ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on
the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic
growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He
also said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private

8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB
considered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is
not proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of
the proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who
are allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a
permanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage
labels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such
products.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all
pseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to
combat.

® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).
expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic
prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”
He emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate
unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°

On February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring
Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government
Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should
identify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that
impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”
and “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private
enterprise and entrepreneurship.”*'

On April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-
Competitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not
predetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that
reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they
create for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed
agency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...
distortions on the operation of a free market.”!2

These are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though
improperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive
Suggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,
issued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.

To comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the
quoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-
proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the
Department of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to
the specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head
of TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that

3. These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record

TTB says'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a
recommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in
the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits '4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a
February 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)'®
joined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or
together, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-
proposed rules.

Regarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes'® the Executive Summary at
the front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,
such as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been
implemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB
should revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory
information on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In
between the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the
report, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the
recommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by
commenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report
recommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the
recommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient
labeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was
therefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen

The CSPI letter of February 24, 2021, represented the view of seven organizations that
exist to advocate particular views, in this case not favorable to the beer, wine, and
spirits industry: CSPI, Alcohol Justice, American Institute for Cancer Research,
Consumer Federation of America, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, National
Consumers League, and U.S. Aicohol Policy Alliance. Advocacy to the federal and
state governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by
the First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state
constitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a
complete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.

4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails
Legal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue
the rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the
benefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to
impose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only

Congress confers power upon it.”); NFIB v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)

Congress has provided."").

2 27 U.S.C. 205(e). The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of
title 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.
205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,
to provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the
product, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the
authority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,
analyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the
case of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the
State into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at
5764, col. 1.
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major
allergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements
of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep
(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things
that are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or
importer -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,
applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that
Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”
unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen
labeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue
the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.

Second, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains
Major Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in
fact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that
TTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits
with its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech
that is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,
distilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in
the production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major
allergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the
allergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility
in exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if
the allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°
If an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but

none of the allergen in the process ends up in the final product -- confirmed, if
necessary, by appropriate analysis of periodic test samples?’ -- the rule should not
require a label stating that the bottle “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” just because a
major allergen was used at some point in the production process.”

Third, TTB failed to calculate the costs of compliance of the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule. To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:

... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the
cost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry
members would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the
Alcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new
allergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just
one label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°

The TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business
assuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling
Rule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal
duty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and
must consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°
TTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes
of the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a
final Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not
an Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,
but not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to
comply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603

Given the serious shortcomings of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, the
Treasury Department should withdraw the proposed rule.

5. The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails
Legal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the
rule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and
Executive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by
law.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury
Department claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)
chapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)
section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant
the authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration
proposed.

Of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only
three provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)
REQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the
revenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits
issued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,
sale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5
wine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section
5368 provides:

(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and
gauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such
manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).

22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has
no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.
1

(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,
vehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with
this chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

Section 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or
sale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled
in such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be
removed from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled
spirits plants under section 5222.”

The three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.
Section 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for
distilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.
Section 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the
comparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different
from marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to
impose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of
labeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also
that the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to
labeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the
Internal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by
volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412
grants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.
Accordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue
Code to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or
beer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.

The Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol
Facts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements

34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in
one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that
Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).
12

of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the
requirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,
alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.
Also, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes
that Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic
significance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant
alcohol facts labeling authority.

The Treasury Department's triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for
Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2
(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which
it can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide
consumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court
decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.
Circuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional
predecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,
there is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates
Congress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient
disclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of
discretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,
as necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with
that congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the
agency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,
104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme
Court rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which
the Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its

3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were
defined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to
authorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.

meaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their
independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory
authority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9

So, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that
leaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.
Congress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when
it wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”

Second, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little
benefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost
the industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement
(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent
years for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has
no reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to
purchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without
admitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them
to purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling
requirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they
otherwise would have faced.

As for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of
alcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to
quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in
the absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”
assuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.
In the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule:

TTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but
as stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide
consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of
alcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice

about moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional
information about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.

The first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a
thread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts
labeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would
mean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but
carbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.
Also, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery
store), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in
a bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it
might be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts
label diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with
respect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the
Alcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to
compare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a
higher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should
take human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on
assumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

The second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
provide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient
content of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the
proposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing
the additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the
labeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the
labeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.

For the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
greatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.

Thirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-
proposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”

4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information
requirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per
container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of
legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in
a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better
for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who
are pregnant.”).

47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or
any other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a
notice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United
15

TTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5
“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And
immediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
But that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to
the proposed rules.

n

The data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises
(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in
this case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the
proposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account
of recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is
$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298
per year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the
Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making
about $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed
charge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.

Particularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its
decision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities:

The production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an
industry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and
advertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding
more elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant
impact on the regulated industry.°!

The TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding
more labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential
policy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.

NFIB recommends and requests that the Department of the Treasury withdraw the rules
on Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed by the Biden Administration three
days before he left office. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the
Department of the Treasury has no legal authority to promulgate the Biden-proposed
rules and failed to provide the regulatory analyses required in proposing the rules. And
the proposed rules run flatly contrary to the deregulatory policies President Trump has
established by executive order. Withdrawal of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling
and Alcohol Facts rules will prevent imposition of unwarranted, burdensome, and costly
rules on small businesses in the beer, wine, and spirits industry.

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
Submitted by: Recover Alaska 
Date: August 7, 2025 
To Whom It May Concern, 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule to require Alcohol Facts 
labeling on wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. Recover Alaska strongly supports 
this rule as a long-overdue and commonsense step toward transparency that will help 
protect public health and empower consumers to make more informed choices. 
Recover Alaska is a statewide multi-sector coalition working to reduce excessive alcohol 
use and its harms across our state. Alaska experiences some of the highest alcohol-related 
death rates in the country. In 2021, our alcohol-induced mortality rate was more than twice 
the national average, and Alaska continues to grapple with the ripple effects of alcohol 
misuse—including high rates of suicide, domestic violence, and child maltreatment. These 
consequences are deeply felt in our rural and Tribal communities, which already face major 
health disparities and limited access to services. 
As a public health organization, we ﬁnd it unacceptable that alcohol—the only consumable 
product in the U.S. directly linked to seven types of cancer—is not required to carry a 
standard nutrition or content label. Consumers have a right to know what is in the products 
they consume, just as they do with food, tobacco, and other regulated substances. 
We urge TTB to ﬁnalize and strengthen this proposed rule in the following ways: 
1. Require On-Package Alcohol Facts Labels 
Vital health information should not be relegated to QR codes or websites. Labels 
must appear directly on alcohol packaging to ensure accessibility—especially for 
people in rural or remote regions, older adults, and those without reliable internet or 
smartphones. In Alaska, this is particularly relevant where broadband access is 
limited and supply chains are complex. 
2. Include Number of Standard Drinks and DGA Guidance 
To support informed drinking decisions, labels should include the number of 
standard drinks per container and refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’  
advice on moderate drinking. This helps consumers relate alcohol content to 
recommended limits and personal health goals. 
3. Mandate Dual-Column and Expanded Nutrition Labeling 
Dual-column labeling (per serving and per container) should be mandatory, not 
voluntary. Many consumers unknowingly consume an entire container of alcohol in 
one sitting. Additionally, the Alcohol Facts panel should require disclosure of 
nutrients the DGA advises limiting: added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. 
4. Shorten the Compliance Period to 3.5 Years 
Public health and safety cannot wait ﬁve more years. A 3.5-year compliance period 
strikes a more appropriate balance between industry readiness and consumers’ 
right to know what they’re drinking. 
As communities and families in Alaska continue to face the heavy burden of alcohol-
related harm, this rule represents a simple yet powerful step toward awareness, 
prevention, and accountability. We commend the TTB for proposing this rule and urge its 
swift adoption with the enhancements outlined above. 
Thank you for your leadership in protecting public health through meaningful, transparent 
alcohol policy. 
Sincerely,

Dear Director Greenberg,  
 
Campari America LLC (“Campari America”), a producer and importer of distilled spirits in the 
United States, submits the following comments in response to the TTB’s Notice No. 237, “Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ,” Docket No. TTB –2025–
0002.  Campari America is a subsidiary of Davide Campari -Milano N.V., which began in 1860 with its 
one eponymous brand.  Today, Campari America sells a wide range of beverage alcohol products in 
the United States, but is most well-known for its portfolio of liqueurs, including Campari, Aperol, Averna, 
Frangelico, Cynar, Braulio , and Grand Marnier .  Many of t hese brands, like those of many other 
suppliers, are not accurately represented in the TTB’s currently proposed serving size reference table, 
pasted below for reference, and which is the basis of our comment today.   
Serving size Alcohol percent by volume 
Wine Distilled spirits Malt beverages 
1.5 fl oz (44 mL), or 50 mL for 50 
mL containers of distilled spirits 
n/a > 24% > 24%. 
2.5 fl oz (74 mL) > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% 
5 fl oz (148 mL) 7 to 16% > 7, up to 16% > 7, up to 16% 
12 fl oz (355 mL) n/a ≤ 7% ≤ 7%. 
 
Proposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Low ABV Liqueurs Are Consumed in Cocktails 
 
The serving sizes recommended above are based in the assumption that the only means of 
drinking a wine, beer, or spirits beverage is straight, unmixed with other beverages.  While this may be 
mostly true for wine and beer, it is most certainly not true for distilled spirits which often serve as 
“ingredients” in a wide range of cocktails.  By way of example, Aperol , which has an ABV of 11%, is 
most commonly consumed in the form of an Aperol Spritz .  When making the brand’s signature 
cocktail, the typical amount of Aperol used is typically 2 ounces, i.e. less than half of what would be 
considered its reference serving size under the TTB’s proposal.  Another Aperol cocktail growing in 
Docusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 
 
popularity is the Paper Plane (0.75 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz Aperol, 0.75 oz Amaro Nonino, and 0.75 oz 
lemon juice), in which the Aperol consumed is less than 1/5 of the TTB proposed serving size. 
Campari faces a similar issue.  While it can be served in a Campari Spritz (typically 1.5 to 2 
ounces), it is also popularly served in a Boulevardier (1 oz Campari, 1 .5 oz bourbon, and 1 oz sweet 
vermouth) or a Negroni (1 oz Campari, 1 oz gin, and 1 oz sweet vermouth) or a Negroni Sbagliato 
(substitute prosecco for gin ).  There is also the Americano (1oz Campari, 1oz sweet vermouth, and a 
splash of club soda) and the Garibaldi (1.5 oz Campari and the fresh juice of one orange, approximately 
4 oz). 
Examples of similar uses of other low-ABV liqueurs in cocktails abound.  Simply put, these are 
not products that are typically drunk straight.  So while the ABV of a lower proof distilled spirit may be 
similar to wine, it is not consumed in the same manner – thus using the same serving size as wine of 5 
oz., or even 2.5 oz, significantly overstates and distorts the actual serving size of these low ABV liqueurs 
in a way that is misleading and confusing for consumers.  
 
Proposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Ready-To-Drink Canned Products Are Consumed 
 
Conversely, for many other products, such as  ready-to-drink can s of  “hard” seltzers and 
cocktails, the currently proposed serving sizes greatly understate the actual serving sizes of these 
products.  These products are commonly sold in a 12 -oz can and can vary from 3.5% to 1 4% ABV.  
Spirits-based cocktails are not the only beverage alcohol products facing this issue:  many beers and 
other malt-based beverages now exceed 7% ABV yet are sold in the same 12 oz size cans.  Likewise, 
canned wines, with ABVs ranging from 8 to 15%, are also sold in sizes larger than the proposed serving 
size of 5 oz.  In these instances, having a serving size reference range that is less than the container 
size will certainly mislead consumers into thinking they are drinking less alcohol than they really are. 
 
Recommended Serving Sizes Already Have A Long-Established Framework and Methodology 
 
As a proposed solution, we recommend adopting an approach similar to  the methodology of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for recommended serving sizes for food and non-alcoholic 
beverages.  The FDA creates reference points, known as “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed” 
or “RACCs,” for different categories of food and beverage, and the FDA then recommends that 
manufacturers use those RACCs as a guideline for determining their advertised serving sizes.   
 
In the food and non -alcoholic beverage realm, FDA-required labelling became required in the 
1990s.  Consumers are long accustomed to this method of calculation of serving facts, with 
recommended or actual consumption amounts being the guiding factor in determining the size.   The 
general understanding of most consumers is that a serving size reflects the size portion of intended or 
typical consumption, or, in the case of single -serve packs, the container size, rather than being based 
on the amount of one of its components .  One analogy would be if the FDA mandated serving sizes 
based on the grams of protein in a product, such as 5g of protein equals one serving size.  This would 
result in a double serving size for a granola bar, and a very small serving size for beef jerky.  Similarly, 
the TTB’s proposed serving sizes are based on the amount of alcohol in a product, resulting in arbitrary 
and sometimes incorrect serving sizes.  The current proposed TTB’s serving sizes would conflict with 
Docusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 
 
the general understanding of most consumers who have been conditioned for decades to perceive a 
serving size as the recommended amount and/or most customarily consumed amount. 
 
If the TTB were to adopt a serving size reference range that mirrors the FDA ’s process, this 
would allow consumers to buy products and understand serving sizes within a framework that they 
already know and are familiar with from the food and non -alcoholic beverage space.  This w ould also 
accommodate the realities of the types of drinks that consumers are currently havin g or making w ith 
beverage alcohol in the 4% to 30% ABV range and would minimize consumer confusion over  serving 
size, especially with respect to ready-to-drink canned products. 
 
Alternatively, if the TTB wants to maintain the serving size reference ranges proposed in Notice 
No. 237, then another recommendation would be for the TTB to allow an exception for suppliers to 
deviate from the proposed serving size reference range if they  can demonstrate that the proposed 
serving size does not reflect the actual amount of their product that is typically consumed.  This would 
allow the TTB to maintain the current framework but still provide flexibility for those suppliers whose  
products are typically consumed as one part of a cocktails.

COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATION  
G/TBT/N/USA/2183 and G/TBT/N/USA/2182 
Allergen and Nutrition Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States 
of America for providing the opportunity to comment on the draft “ Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ”, notified on 22 
January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2183.  
The mandatory labelling of ‘Major Food Allergen’ referred to in the US proposed 
rulemaking includes fish ingredients. The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required 
when the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify 
wines and beers. 
At a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the 
exposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert 
Committee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the 
European Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an 
established history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the 
reference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of 
exposure for derivative safety assessment. 
The EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or 
fish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen 
labelling. 
As regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, 
the EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines 
on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-
2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars 
included in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to 
highlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory 
indication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, 
contrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated 
on traded alcoholic beverages. 
Finally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed 
5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the 
operators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before 
the proposed rule comes into effect.

account and replied to before adoption of the notified draft.

RE Notice No.os 237 & 238 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages; and Major Food
Allergen Labeling for Wineso Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages
Comments of the Kentuckv Distillers' Association
Dear Director,
We are outside counsel for the Kentucky Distillers' Association, located in
Frankfort, Kentucky (""KDA""). The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits
producers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and
its membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on
potential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.
While the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two
notices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit
comments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise
similar concerns for Kentucky's spirits industry. Please accept the following as the
KDA's comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket
TTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to
require the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of
distilled spirits.
Since the KDA's founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and
responsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky's signature Bourbon and Distilled
Spirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world's
supply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As
such, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and
administrative impact on our members.

1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers
The KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs
associated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft
producers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to
distilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff
and capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be
an expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping
units (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued
testing would be cost prohibitive.
It is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated
to be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits
labels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic
and logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive
packaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real
estate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them
ignore key labeling information altogether.
2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion
The proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces
redundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by
volume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the
requirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further
by requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,
which will result in customer confusion.
Customers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being
quantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on
the Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of
alcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or
misinterpret the label entirely.
Further, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes
proteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed
Alcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in
the product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer
would reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that
there are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.

The KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due
to the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.
3. Digital Labeling Options
Spirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As
discussed, to keep consumers' attention and give them the ability to learn more about
certain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such
an approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy
'click through' for the latest and more in-depth product information.
Moreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for
printing new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant
environmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost
ninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for
helping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less
environmental effects.
4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process
As TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -
including gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a
proper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled
spirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the
exception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled
spirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced
post-distillation.
The KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption
regarding TTB's testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-
case basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself
by requiring lab analysis of every product.
If the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final
rulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due
to the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation
product. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause
tremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be
'gluten-free' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about
gluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill
information or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.
Including more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI

potential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential
customers.
5. Conclusion
As TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to
consider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations
that consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and
other spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are
already well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing
more than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing
inefficiencies.

Comments filed on behalf of FEVS (Fédération des Exportateurs de Vins et Spiritueux de France) 
 
Filed via www.regulations.gov 
 
 
Re: TTB‐2025‐0002: Alcohol Facts Statements in the labelling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages 
 
 
The French Federation of Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), appreciates the opportunity to submit comments 
on Notice No. 238 relative to Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FEVS is the trade association representing the wine and spirit exporting companies of France. FEVS's 
membership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with 
exports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for 
French wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). 
 
FEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American 
consumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and 
quality of the wines and spirits they purchase. 
 
Therefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on TTB’s proposed rulemaking. 
 
 
On the title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
FEVS encourages TTB to adopt the tile “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”, as the proposed content 
of the statement refers to nutrition information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverage, rather than 
information on alcohol. Therefore, the title “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest that 
the statement includes general indication on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
 
In addition, consumers are accustomed to the title “ Serving Facts” and to the fact that this is related to 
nutrition information of the beverage they intend to purchase or consume, since most operators who 
currently voluntarily disclose nutrition information use “ Serving Facts ”, as acknowledged by TTB in the 
Notice. As a consequence, choosing the “ Serving Facts” title would also limit costs of re -labelling for these 
operators. 
 
Lastly, FEVS believes that the similarity between “ Serving Facts”, which could apply to alcoholic beverages 
regulated under IRC, and “ Nutrition Facts”, required for alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA rules, is 
more beneficial to consumers as it ensures a kind of coherence on how the nutrition information is provided 
for all products proposed for sale on the market – even if the content of their respective statement may differ 
as proposed by TTB for the former. 
 
2 
On the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
FEVS thanks TTB to take into account particularities of the wines and spirits production process and sector 
by proposing a content of a nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what 
is required for other food products through the FDA Nutrition Facts label. 
 
Nevertheless, FEVS would like to underline that wine or spirits do not contain fat or proteins and is wondering 
whether the compulsory presence of these two elements in a n Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
would provide useful information to consumers when choosing which alcoholic beverage they want to 
purchase or drink. Whether TTB decides to keep these two elements and considering the limited space of 
wine and spirits labels, FEVS suggests allowing operators to replace these two lines by a unique sentence like 
“Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the Statement. 
 
FEVS takes note of the voluntary sugar content  statement as proposed by TTB. In case operators choose to 
indicate it, FEVS kindly requests TTB to clarify how precisely they will have to label it and how the articulation 
with the carbohydrates content TTB intends to require will have to be made. 
 
More globally, FEVS would like to raise the attention of TTB regarding the difficulty adding other elements 
to the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, including through a voluntary approach, 
because of: 
• the non-relevance of nutrients like sodium, cholesterol, saturated fat… for alcoholic beverages, 
• the risk introducing nutrients like vitamins or minerals or percentage of the daily value may lead to 
unintended alcohol consumption behaviors, 
• the fact that the more information is added within the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, the 
more the impact of the most relevant ones for consumers, notably calories, will be diluted, 
• the limited space available on wine and spirits packaging (compared to other food products), 
• the difficulty for operators to put in place the full traceability, risk assessment and analytical procedures 
to guarantee the loyalty and accurate content of such information, 
• the possible impact of such requirement on a trade perspective, for products imported into the US as 
well as for US wine and spirits exported to third countries. 
 
In case TTB is willing to require or to give operators the possibility to include additional elements in the 
Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, FEVS strongly encourages TTB to allow this statement to be 
provided by electronic means like QR-Code (see below). 
 
Finally, FEVS welcomes the tolerance of 20% above or below proposed by TTB as well as the use of “typical 
value” charts in order to ease the ability of wine and spirits operators, especially SMEs, fulfilling the envisaged 
requirements. FEVS strongly encourages TTB to work as far as possible with US trade partners to develop a 
coordinated approach on these “typical values”. 
 
FEVS would like also to stress the importance of including in the TTB regulation the notion of  “average 
values” a s defined by Codex Alimentarius for the nutrition declaration
1. Being complementary to 
tolerances, “average values” would allow operators to provide accurate information to consumers while 
avoiding the re-labelling of their products each year because of crops or evolution of the production method. 
 
 
On the alcohol content statement 
 
FEVS takes note of the TTB proposal requiring an alcohol content statement, expressed as a percentage of 
alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverages products, as well as an indication of this statement 
 
1 See Point 3.5 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling: “The values used in nutrient declaration should be weighted average values 
derived from data speciﬁcally obtained from analyses of products which are representative of the product being labelled.” 3 
within the existing  tolerances (in substitution of an indication in terms of ranges). This is aligned with EU 
rules and will ensure consistency in the presentation of products regardless of their alcohol content. 
 
FEVS would also appreciate whether TTB could clarify if this requirement would apply to non-alcoholic wines 
(less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) sold on the US market, too. 
 
On the other hand, FEVS asks TTB not to require the inclusion of the alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement. While practical modalities regarding the placement of the alcohol content may differ 
between malt beverages, distilled spirits or wines, c onsumers are used to find this information in the same 
field of vision of other compulsory particulars. In addition, under current TTB regulations, the alcohol content 
has to be labelled in a bigger type size than other compulsory information. Therefore, FEVS does not see why 
including alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, among several other elements 
related to the product, will guarantee a better visibility or understanding for consumers. 
 
If TTB want s nevertheless going forward on this, FEVS kindly recommends proposing it as an option for 
operators, allowing them the possibility either to indicate the alcohol content as it is today or to include it in 
the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
FEVS would also like to share concerns regarding the compulsory indication of the alcohol content in fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol. Firstly, concept of pure alcohol is not always well understood by consumers. Thus, 
providing this information without context would not necessarily empower consumers to make informed 
choices or to understand why and how it differs from the alcohol content expressed in volume by alcohol.  
Second, FEVS notes that TTB is allowing operators, in addition to these two elements, to indicate the alcohol 
content in degrees of proof ; meaning the same information could appear in three different forms in the 
Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
Beyond issues related to limited available space o n labels and to the complexity for foreign operators who 
do not usually use the fluid ounces of pure alcohol as unit of measurement, FEVS fears the proposed approach 
could lead to an important risk of confusion by consumers. 
 
In addition, FEVS tends to consider that a “per serving size” presentation could increase the difficulties for 
consumers to fully understand the elements provided in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. As 
rightly pointed out in the Notice, serving size reference amounts could be considered  by consumers as a 
recommended consumption amount rather than a way to determine the  alcohol, nutrient or calorie intake 
of a specific beverage. Besides, since serving size would have to differ depending on  the alcohol content of 
the product, this will prevent consumers from making comparisons between several alcoholic beverages on 
their respective nutritional impact, due to the lack of an identical basis for comparison. 
 
This approach will also lead to additional complexity for wine and spirits companies, especially exporters who 
are not used to managing serving size and/or will have to manage specific ones for the US market. 
 
FEVS would also like to recall that Codex Alimentarius recommends that the nutrition declaration should be 
expressed per 100 ml and “in addition, this information may be given per serving as quantified on the label“
2. 
 
Whether TTB confirms its intention to request nutrition information to be provided in pure alcohol per 
serving, FEVS strongly suggests TTB to allow the electronic display of these elements. Indeed, the presence 
of a QR -Code on a label could facilitate the provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure 
alcohol and standard drinks, including in relation with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans  if relevant, 
which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. It  would also reduce the conformity c osts for 
operators, especially those non-US based,  thanks to  automatic calculation of nutrition content of their 
product and conversion of the figures into US unit measures (see below). 
 
 
 
2 See Point 3.4.2 and 3.43 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling 4 
On the Alcohol Beverages Information Statement disclosure 
 
While acknowledging the flexibilities proposed by TTB for the display of the Alcohol Beverages Information 
Statement (ie, linear display option and lesser rules in terms of format and size on the panel), FEVS strongly 
reiterates its call to TTB for allowing these information to be distributed by electronic means. 
 
As previously raised, electronic labelling offers a wide range of advantages to both consumers and operators, 
especially SMEs. Indeed, this digital mean makes it possible: 
• for companies, to have a tool adapted to the variability of wines and spirits, thus limiting the costs of 
modifying packaging, while guaranteeing the loyalty of the information,  
• for the consumer, an easy and permanent access to information (including for people with disabilities), 
updated in real time and in his own language (in or outside the US territory), 
• for public authorities, to avoid the creation of barriers to trade by facilitating convergence of standards 
and administrative cooperation: 
o between the United States and wine and spirits exporting countries, 
o between federal regulations and the increasing number of labelling requirements in force at 
State level (e.g. with regard to beverage packaging deposits schemes). 
 
It also has to be noted that technological challenges (like adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage) or ability to 
access for particular communities are evolving very quickly, having in mind any final rule on Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement would only apply in more than five years from now. 
 
In the EU, the labelling of energy and nutrition information and the list of ingredients is compulsory for wine 
products since December 2023 and the spirits sector commit to provide these information on a voluntary 
basis. The EU experience demonstrates the possibility of using the advantages of the QR -Code without 
lowering the ability of consumers to access  key information for their health and for making informed 
choice. Indeed, for companies willing to use digital means, EU regulations oblige them to indicate the calories 
amount as well as the allergens on the physical label, while other information, compulsory or not, are 
displayed online, via a direct and free of marketing information link. 
 
FEVS would like to underline how aligning EU and US requirements on nutrition and energy information 
would be beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, while allowing each party to keep 
its own preference on the content of the information to be provided according to its respective context. This 
would also allow the EU  and US to set a global standard which could support the development of digital 
technologies and avoid trade barriers in third countries market. 
 
In the case of physical labelling, FEVS requests to remove the black box around the Alcohol Beverage 
Information Statement, especially when provided in a linear format . This appear not to be proportionate 
or justified as the title “ Serving Facts” in bold type on a defined space which is a label is sufficient to allow 
consumers to easily locate the information on the packaging. 
 
On the implementation period 
 
FEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the statement. 
 
In addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to 
put on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force 
of any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. 
 
Finally, if TTB adopt s a final rule on Major Food Allergens labelling (as envisaged in Notice  of proposed 
rulemaking No. 238), FEVS asks for an identical date of entry into force for both regulations . This will

Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement

*We consider that the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided inthe proposed statement.*

Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information

*Following the same rationale applied to nutritional information, sugar content should remain voluntary. If most alcohol beverages contain only minimal or negligible amounts of sugar, requiring its inclusion would provide little added value to consumers. Similarly, we agree with TTB’s assessment that sodium and other micronutrients should not be included, and we believe they should not be referenced in the proposal at all.*

*We believe that including daily value percentages for nutrients on alcohol beverage labels would be confusing for consumers. Such information could misleadingly suggest that alcohol contributes meaningfully to meeting daily nutritional requirements, which is not the case. Given the fundamental differences between alcoholic beverages and foods, adopting the Nutrition Facts format used by the FDA would not be appropriate in this context.*

*Given that many alcoholic beverages contain negligible amounts of nutrients beyond calories, requiring full nutrition facts similar to FDA food labels could be unnecessarily burdensome and confusing, potentially disadvantaging certain products in both domestic and international markets.*

Calculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels

*We support the proposed tolerances of ±20% and the use of ""typical values"" as a valid alternative to mandatory testing. Allowing broad tolerances and the use of tables or calculation methods to estimate nutrient levels is important to keep costs down and maintain competitiveness. Requiring precise in-house testing or sending products to third-party labs would create significant financial challenges, especially for small producers who make small batches and cannot spread testing costs over many units.*

Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products

*We have no objections to the proposal requiring an alcohol content statement expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume on all alcohol beverage labels. This requirement does not pose any issues, as it is already mandatory in Argentina to indicate the alcohol content on all wines. Such labeling ensures transparency for consumers and aligns with existing international practices.*

Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement

*While it is likely that including alcohol content information within the Alcohol Facts statement could make it easier for consumers to locate this information, this advantage may not be particularly significant. Consumers are generally accustomed to looking for alcohol content in various parts of the label, and the overall impact on their ability to find this information is expected to be minimal.*

*The implications of including the alcohol content within the Alcohol Facts statement should be carefully analyzed to avoid the requirement of declaring the alcohol content in two separate locations on the label. According to the World Wine Trade Group (WWTG) Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling, wines may display common mandatory information (CMI), including alcohol content, anywhere on the container’s surface visible within a single field of vision. This approach helps ensure clarity and prevents redundant labeling. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the agreements established within the WWTG. If the information must appear in multiple locations on the label, this could increase label redesign and printing costs. Additionally, unclear placement requirements might lead to confusion among producers, complicating compliance efforts and potentially increasing administrative burdens. Moreover, having the alcohol content displayed in two different places with differing values could lead to labeling errors and mislead consumers.*

Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol per Serving

*If it is mandatory to indicate the alcohol content as a percentage by volume, requiring additional information about the alcohol content per serving size or standard drink would be redundant and could potentially confuse or mislead consumers. Providing multiple measures of alcohol content on the label may create inconsistency and make it harder for consumers to clearly understand the actual alcohol strength of the product.*

Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

a. Linear Display

*We believe it would be appropriate to provide the option for Alcohol Facts information to be presented either in a panel or linear format, as proposed.*

b. Type Size

*We agree with the proposal that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements should mirror the existing type size requirements for mandatory information*

c. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

*We suggest allowing the possibility of using electronic means, such as QR codes, to present this information, especially for small containers or labels with limited space, while ensuring that mandatory physical labeling remains the minimum requirement.*

Serving Size Reference Amounts

*Proposed serving size amounts should be reference values only. Each consumer, if interested, can evaluate their total intake of alcohol, nutrients, and calories when consuming amounts greater than the reference serving size. The reference amounts serve their purpose by providing a consistent basis for labeling and informing consumer choices without implying a recommended level of consumption.*

*According to Wine in Moderation, the reference consumption guidelines are: up to 2 units of alcohol per day for women (equivalent to approximately 200 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV), and up to 3 units per day for men (approximately 300 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV). Additionally, no more than 4 units of alcohol should be consumed on a single drinking occasion.*

Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display

*We agree with allowing the option to present Alcohol Facts in a dual-column format.*

*We also support the proposal requiring containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving.*

Implementation Period

*The proposed 5-year compliance period for the new labeling regulations is both adequate and reasonable, as it allows the industry ample time to adapt gradually without imposing excessive economic or operational pressures. This timeframe helps minimize costs and facilitates a smooth transition toward more comprehensive and transparent labeling for consumers.*

*However, a shorter period (e.g., 3 years) could be considered only if the labeling is limited to basic elements (alcohol content and calories) and does not include a broader set of nutrients or ingredient declarations.*

*It is likely that some industry members will choose to begin implementing the labeling changes before the official compliance date. Many producers may prefer to adapt to the new requirements earlier to stay ahead of regulations and manage inventory efficiently.*

*Furthermore, it is essential that new label approval applications (COLA) are not required when changes are limited to the inclusion or modification of nutritional information, such as the Alcohol Facts panel or data on calories and alcohol content.*",0,-1,"[-1, 0, 16]",-1,0,16,neutral,0.997550904750824,"{'admiration': 7.58316382416524e-05, 'amusement': 8.840000373311341e-05, 'anger': 0.00010136599303223193, 'annoyance': 0.00025432716938667, 'approval': 0.00047078923671506345, 'caring': 4.5586435589939356e-05, 'confusion': 0.0001529846922494471, 'curiosity': 7.3584946221672e-05, 'desire': 3.070889943046495e-05, 'disappointment': 0.00010492726869415492, 'disapproval': 0.00012861783034168184, 'disgust': 6.0464077250799164e-05, 'embarrassment': 2.7156131181982346e-05, 'excitement': 6.982008198974654e-05, 'fear': 6.82524114381522e-05, 'gratitude': 4.504021126194857e-05, 'grief': 1.689855707809329e-05, 'joy': 6.833356019342318e-05, 'love': 3.090200334554538e-05, 'nervousness': 1.7831180230132304e-05, 'optimism': 7.331716187763959e-05, 'pride': 1.1147639270348009e-05, 'realization': 0.00028061174089089036, 'relief': 1.3445260265143588e-05, 'remorse': 1.4519309843308292e-05, 'sadness': 8.336851897183806e-05, 'surprise': 4.086816989001818e-05, 'neutral': 0.997550904750824}"

However, a shorter period (e.g., 3 years) could be considered only if the labeling is limited to basic 
elements (alcohol content and calories) and does not include a broader set of nutrients or ingredient 
declarations.
It is likely that some industry members will choose to begin implementing the labeling changes before the 
official compliance date. Many producers may prefer to adapt to the new requirements earlier to stay 
ahead of regulations and manage inventory efficiently.
Furthermore, it is essential that new label approval applications (COLA) are not required when changes are 
limited to the inclusion or modification of nutritional information, such as the Alcohol Facts panel or data

TTB Proposal on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. 
Key points of the proposal: 
 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: 
1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). 
2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. 
3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 
4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal 
establishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary 
depending on their alcohol content. For example: 
i. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) 
ii. Wines: 
1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. 
2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. 
iii. Distilled spirits: 
1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; 
2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; 
3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid 
ounces (44 ml) 
4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. 
 
 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
Compliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register 
is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
Comments on the proposal: 
 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but 
question the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not 
considered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-
006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the 
declaration of the product's alcohol content. 
 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of 
alcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested 
that this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, 
digital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. 
 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as 
if these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius 
guidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and 
that nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do 
the differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  
misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s 
labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the 
listed nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? 
Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol 
beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? 
Our position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely 
benefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage 
labeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels 
could easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which 
would only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting 
nutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that 
alcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing 
decisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. 
Furthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are 
fundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic 
beverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol 
itself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as 
somehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current 
labeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are 
distinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, 
which goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT 
Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers 
to international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly 
recommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This 
makes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
 Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
 Easy updating as regulations change. 
 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks 
of harmful alcohol consumption. 
 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to 
implement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for 
distribution in the U.S. 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
It is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and 
trans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the 
misconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
The inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be 
misle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could 
confuse consumers. 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create 
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
It is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could 
create a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true 
and could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or 
rehabilitation benefits. 
The General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be 
limited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them 
as something that improves health or well-being. 
Furthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages 
from being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from 
promoting harmful eating habits. 
The Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition 
by establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, 
rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or 
health benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such 
declarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the 
identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol 
Facts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated 
with such revisions? 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate 
unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
This measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and 
distributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would 
go against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical 
regulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives 
justified by member states. 
According to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly 
necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures 
would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased 
costs associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new 
shipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, 
new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, 
especially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  
analyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply 
chains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
It is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade 
in alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to 
consider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the 
use of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical 
labels, while reducing operational costs. 
Conclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol 
is sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided 
electronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant 
costs, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic 
beverages in general.

Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Introduction 
spiritsEUROPE represents the interests of the European distilled spirits industry. Our members include 
31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base 
in Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion 
in 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United 
States. 
 
We would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” to the WTO TBT Committee. We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if 
needed. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as flexible as possible, and do not result 
in unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while ensuring the meaningful information of 
consumers. 
 
In this context, spiritsEUROPE would like to highlight the following key requests: 
• Replace the title of the informational statement with “Serving Facts” instead of “Alcohol 
Facts” to more accurately reflect its content.  
• Permit the use of digital tools , particularly QR codes , to provide the “Serving Facts” 
statement to minimise the impact of the new rules on trade, align with existing industry 
practices and self-regulation, as encouraged by the European Commission, and – for wine – 
existing EU requirements. 
• Keep the inclusion of ABV and the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the “Serving Facts” 
optional, as the ABV is already stated elsewhere on the container and the concept of ""pure 
alcohol"" is not widely understood by consumers. 
• Introduce greater flexibility regarding serving sizes, as they vary across countries and can also 
depend on the category of spirits and the alcohol content of the product. 
• Ensure both proposals enter into force simultaneously and include a stock exhaustion clause 
for all products placed on the market prior to implementation. 
 
You will find our detailed comments and recommendations on these proposals below. 
 
I. Comments on the “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages” 
1. On the Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement 
 
We believe that the title of the informational statement should be “Serving Facts” and not “Alcohol 
Facts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the nutritional information in a 
serving of a specific alcoholic beverage . “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest 
that the statement includes general indications on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. In 
addition, consumers are accustomed to finding nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement 
because most operators who currently voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the 
title.

2. On the Display of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) 
 
spiritsEUROPE would kindly recommend that TTB allow the possibility to make the “Serving Facts” 
statement available electronically, in particular through the use of a QR code. Although exempted to 
do so by EU law, the EU spirits sector decided to develop an ambitious self -regulatory approach to 
provide consumers with: 
• (language free) energy information on the back label (per 100ml and serving, in kJ and Kcal – 
as is standard for other food and beverages  in the EU) including the number of portions per 
container; and 
• the full nutrition al information (including fat, carbohydrates and protein) via the scanning a 
QR code present on the back label. 
 
The latest report published on 18 June 2024  shows that the share of spirit  drinks bottles complying 
with the self-regulatory commitment on the provision of consumer information has grown from 0% to 
70% in just 5 years. 
 
Companies are also increasingly mirroring this approach outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. 
 
While this approach is a self -regulatory commitment for the spirits sector in the EU, it is a legal 
requirement for the wine sector since 8 December 2023, including for US wine bottles exported to the 
European Union. Aligning EU and US requirements on nutritional and energy information would be 
beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since EU requirements for 
wine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well beyond the EU. 
 
On the other hand, considering the high number of EU spirits companies that provide nutritional 
information digitally, having two substantially different systems in the main markets of both partners 
would create a significant barrier to trade . This would negatively affect both US and EU companies 
seeking to export to the other market. 
 
The benefits of a single, aligned  approach that combines on -pack labelling and digital labelling 
elements are manifold. Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and 
user-friendly feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a 
smart phone or other electronic device.  
 
In addition, digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: 
• Digital labels empower economic operators to swiftly update information  and to adapt 
information to consumers easily, while reducing waste and costs associated to changes with 
traditional physical labels, thus promoting sustainability. 
• Recycling information and other sustainability -related information can easily be integrated 
into digital labels. One such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling 
information for glass bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible 
digital labels since last year.  
• Digital labelling is also SME friendly : craft producers will benefit from being able to provide 
digital consumer information as it enables them to drastically cut down on labelling costs and 
explore new markets, for instance thanks to the geo-sensitive nature of QR codes. This is true 
for craft producers from overseas, who will find it easier to enter the US market, providing 
consumers with more choice in the process. This is equally true for US craft operators, who 
will be better able to export to other markets by making use of digital labelli ng to minimise 
differences and reduce costs.   
 
In the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical label, 
we would kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by a 
box. We would like to stress  that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement,   
 3 
regulations should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The 
space available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would unnecessarily 
take up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in bold type is sufficient 
to allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label. 
 
3. On the Content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) 
 
As noted above, the space available on a label of distilled spirits is limited . We therefore appreciate 
that the TTB is not proposing to align the “Serving Facts” statement with the Nutrition Facts Label of 
the FDA. We also welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations. 
 
However, in the spirit of facilitating international trade of alcoholic beverages, we would like to 
reiterate our recommendation that the TTB aligns its proposal with the requirements in the EU for 
wines (including US wines exported to the EU) , i.e. to require the provision of energy information on 
the label and of nutritional information online. 
 
Whether online or on the label, the “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the 
alcohol content statement (alcohol by volume, ABV) . As the Notice  rightly points out , for distilled 
spirits, the ABV is already required to appear  in the same field of vision as the brand name and the 
class designation. Consumers are therefore used to finding this information on the main/front label. 
Particularly in the case of physical label, space is limited and adding it to the “Serving Facts” would not 
add any value.  
 
In addition, we would kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving 
in the “Serving Facts” statement optional . Providing this information without context would not 
necessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pure alcohol is not well 
understood. On the other hand, the presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the provision of 
substantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary 
Guidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. 
 
Finally, we very much welcome the fact  that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA 
applications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion  or alteration of the “Serving 
Facts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the inclusion or 
alteration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” statement in this manner. 
 
4. On the Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts 
 
We would also welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes.  We believe the 
proposed approach to serving sizes does not accurately reflect how our products are usually 
consumed. 
 
Serving sizes can vary from country to country and vary depending on the ABV of the product. There 
is a wide variety of spirits above 24% and the serving size of a 65% ABV absinthe would be different to 
that of a 24% ABV liqueur. 
 
In addition, this approach fails to take into account that lower ABV spirits (such as liqueurs ) are 
typically consumed as part of mixed drinks rather than as standalone pours. Mandating rigid serving 
sizes based solely on ABV thresholds may mislead consumers and conflict with customary serving 
practices and supplier recommendations. For instance, liqueurs and cordials often recommended in 2 
oz (60 ml) pours could be inaccurately represented by a 5 oz (150 ml) serving size under the proposed 
rules. This misalignment risks confusing consumers, undermining brand integrity, and inadvertently 
encouraging higher alcohol and calorie consumption. 
  
 4 
The proposed approach also fails to account for the rapidly growing Ready -to-Drink (RTD) category, 
where products with very similar profiles but slightly different ABVs (e.g., 7% vs 8%) could be subject 
to inconsistent and confusing serving size declarations. 
 
Rather than enforcing a one -size-fits-all mode l, we urge TTB to allow producers flexibility in 
determining an appropriate serving size reflective of how the product is intended to be enjoyed. This 
could be done by retaining the current serving size guidelines as optional defaults, while also 
permitting customised serving sizes where justified by product type and consumption patterns. This 
flexible approach would provide consumers with more accurate and meaningful information while 
allowing producers to maintain control over their product presentation and brand integrity. 
 
5. On the Proposed Implementation Period 
 
spiritsEUROPE welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic 
climate for our sector, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for our members. 
  
We would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on 
the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of our products can often 
be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. 
 
Finally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into force is 
aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.

To Whom It May Concern, 
 
GS1 US appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau's (TTB) proposal to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient 
content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels. As an 
organization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US understands the importance of 
leveraging data and technology to improve transparency and enhance consumer access to detailed 
product information that supports informed decision making. We commend TTB’s commitment to 
these goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute our insights. 
 
For over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver 
safe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC 
barcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners 
identify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions 
of businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 
members across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage 
production, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. 
 
As a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify 
industry challenges and build consensus on best practices for solving them by leveraging global 
standards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global 
standards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards 
help empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access 
to the information they want and need about those products. 
 
2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Alcohol Labeling 
GS1 US recognizes the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with 
essential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, 
particularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid 
in achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as the UPC barcode, can only hold a limited 
amount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of  
 
www.gs1us.org  2 
storing much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates, 
vintage, age, and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing 
comprehensive information in a compact format. 
 
Incorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) – the globally unique 
product identifier embedded in UPCs today - can effectively support consumer access to detailed 
nutrition information. The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and 
consumer value of digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform 
launched in 2015 to provide detailed product information via QR codes, which leverage GS1 
Standards. This approach is in line with food industry initiatives like SmartLabel® and promotes 
consumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. This digital approach can 
work in tandem with the required physical label disclosures, enhancing the essential information 
presented to consumers. It not only meets the transparency goals of the proposed rule but also 
enables future enhancements, including ingredient disclosures, allergen declarations, information 
regarding sustainability practices, or responsible consumption messaging.  
 
A GS1 Digital Link enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and 
nutritional information, including allergens and dynamic data such as recalls or safety alerts, 
through a simple smartphone scan. In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and 
nutritional information, 2D barcodes encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and 
interoperable format, ensuring accuracy and consistency across retail and digital platforms.  
Including the GTIN in a QR code with GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product 
information. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into gateways to consumer 
information, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand loyalty while improving 
supply chain traceability. 
 
Moreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up valuable label 
space. QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater 
capacity for information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing 
comprehensive data. Moreover, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already 
familiar with scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American 
adults use smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said that they would scan a QR 
code to access product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers 
consumers to easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. 
 
 
Application of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information 
GS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification 
and efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open standards can significantly 
enhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be applied to 
support industry compliance with Alcohol Facts requirements: 
 
1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, 
parties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the  
 
www.gs1us.org  3 
manufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to 
recognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information. 
2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies 
such as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical 
information like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate 
capture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. 
3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data 
formats allows for seamless information exchanges across the supply chain. This 
transparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their 
confidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by 
facilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. 
 
Conclusion 
Incorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN identification, 2D barcodes, and GS1 Digital 
Link into the TTB’s Alcohol Facts labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance consumer 
access to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only help industry stakeholders 
efficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future advancements in 
the digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively with TTB, industry 
partners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of this important 
initiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the opportunity to 
contribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol beverage 
products.

That makes sense because ABV can vary greatly and has a direct impact on safe consumption. However, alcohol is not a &ldquo;food product&rdquo; and is a non-essential beverage &mdash; trying to regulate it as though it were a packaged grocery item sets a troubling precedent.<br/><br/>If a producer chooses to include calorie or nutritional information voluntarily to appeal to a certain consumer segment, that&rsquo;s their choice. It may even be a marketing advantage. But I strongly oppose making it mandatory. Wine already has an age restriction for purchase; adults choosing to drink assume a certain amount of personal risk. We don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; consumers with more mandated warnings and panels.<br/><br/>This proposal would also create a logistical nightmare for the industry. Labels are already required to include a large amount of information &mdash; varietal, vintage, appellation, health warnings, alcohol content &mdash; and space is limited. For smaller bottles and unique designs, there is physically no room to add another standardized panel without removing existing legally required or brand elements.<br/><br/>Costs would be significant, especially for small and mid-size producers who already face thin margins. Every label change means design work, printing costs, and compliance delays. For wineries producing multiple SKUs, the burden multiplies.<br/><br/>Ingredient listing requirements raise further concerns. Will winemakers have to list fining agents such as bentonite, casein, or egg whites, even though they&rsquo;re removed before bottling? Will common enological tools like potassium bicarbonate or tartaric acid need to be spelled out, potentially alarming consumers unfamiliar with normal winemaking practices? The average person has no context for these terms and may assume they are &ldquo;additives&rdquo; to avoid, even when they&rsquo;re safe and essential to quality.<br/><br/>If the intent is transparency, there are better options. Linking a QR code or website with batch-specific information allows for accuracy and flexibility without forcing constant label reprints. This also avoids the need to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; data on a printed label that may vary from vintage to vintage.<br/><br/>In short, this proposal creates more confusion than clarity, risks consumer misunderstanding, imposes high costs on producers, and opens the door to further overreach by treating alcohol as a packaged food product.

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA, dedicated to promoting evidence-based policies that protect public health and safety. We would like to offer the following comments on the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposed rulemaking for 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237.    It is past time for the baseline labeling requirements for alcoholic beverages to be brought in line with those of nearly every other food product. As a consumable product, alcohol is responsible for a substantial morbidity and mortality burden, causing 178,000 deaths per year in the United States, of which 117,000 were due to health complications arising from drinking recklessly over the long term.1 Yet in many cases, consumers have little knowledge about what is in a bottle of alcohol—extending even to how much alcohol, the key ingredient that exempts these products from labeling requirements, the package contains.  The need for these extends far beyond a general intent to support the public’s health. Surveys show that consumers have overwhelming expressed support for additional information when purchasing alcoholic products, 77% strongly supporting more information on alcohol content specifically.2 This information is critical for supporting emerging alcohol consumption trends, which increasingly favor “mindful drinking” that centers intentionality, control, and a deeper understanding of how consumption impacts the body.3 We applaud TTB’s efforts to move forward with regulation that addresses this information gap.  We would like to offer the following feedback to TTB’s specified concerns. We are not addressing all questions posed in the Request for Comment, only those for which we believe we have public health-centered arguments.  Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Sheet  
1.  “Alcohol Facts” is preferable to “Serving Facts” as it centers the idea that alcohol is not a nutrient and alcoholic products are not a standard part of any diet. It also flags that there can and will be information in that area that goes beyond what would be expected on a standard label, specifically alcohol content.  3.  Consumers will reflexively seek content information in the same place they find it with other products. For the purposes of alcoholic beverages, that would be the white box with specific product contents specified, even if said box is labeled “Alcohol Facts” instead of “Serving Facts”.   4. “Alcohol Facts” would provide some helpful distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, but only for motivated consumers. If drawing a clear distinction is a priority—and with the explosion of “crossover products” that use a known nonalcoholic brand identity to sell alcoholic beverages,4 TTB should be establishing further plans to require clear disambiguation.  Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information  1.  We support harmonizing the “Alcohol Facts” requirements with standing FDA requirements. A large part of this support is based on the principal that alcoholic beverages should not be exempt from simple obligations to inform that every other consumable has to abide by. We recognize the concern about consumers assuming they can get nutrients from alcohol consumption, however the industry already engages in misleading health impact claims.5 The irony is that, at present, voluntary “Nutrition Facts” labels are often used to support these claims, while the relative validity of them is untestable because so many products opt not to have those labels. In this instance, consistency creates accountability.  2, 3.  We support as close an analogy to the FDA warnings as possible, even in the case of nutrients that are rarely found in alcoholic products, because rarity is not the same as a guarantee that a product will not have an exceptional amount of sodium or trans-fats.  4.  So long as the producer is allowed to claim an alcoholic beverage contains any given vitamin or mineral, they should be obligated to attest to the amount that is in the container.  6. Popular support for “Alcohol Facts” is quite high, ranging from 64% for nutritional content to 77% for alcohol content.2 Being able to not only understand that contents of an alcoholic beverage, but to be able to compare them while in the store, forms a core principle of informed shopping—as well as a core principle of bodily autonomy, when you consider the fact that without them most people do not know what is going into their bodies. On a less abstract level, across-the-board nutrient labeling allows consumers to avoid nutrients they wish to avoid, and to verify claims made by manufacturers.  9. Although international regulations are heterogenous, there is no case in which erring on the side of more on-label information would complicate an export—but many cases in which too little on-label information would do so.   Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products  1.  The exemption from alcohol by volume (ABV) labeling for “table wines” creates an explicit health hazard. The range of strengths under which labeling is not necessary creates an inability for the consumer to responsibly track their consumption. The risks from acute overconsumption, when comparing e.g. half a bottle of 8% ABV wine to half a bottle of 13% ABV wine, are moderate but present. The risks from chronic consumption at that level are substantial. While we maintain that the “j-shaped curve” is largely an artifact of poor study design,6 even studies which support that curve find that purported benefits evaporate for both sexes at consumption levels of 3 drinks per day or more.7 With the enormous ranges of tolerance within table wine labeling, it can easily lead to unwitting overconsumption.  3. An increase in tolerance for reported ABV on packaging very easily can lead someone to consume more than they intended, particularly within larger bottles and similar containers. This could create severe health impacts over the long run.  4. Based on the principle that all products sold for consumption should be transparent about ingredients, “non-alcoholic” malt beverages should also be subject to nutrition labeling requirements.  6. A range of content as wide as “7% to 14%” is tantamount to not providing any information about ABV.  It is impossible to plan for one’s alcohol intake when the information given is so uncertain.   Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement  1.  The preferred venue for alcohol content information would be on the front of the label, in large type, in a readily legible font. Having alcohol content information in addition be part of the Alcohol Facts label would still serve consumers well, however.  It would be easy to locate, would facilitate comparison between products, potentially reduce the ability of producers to disguise ABV—or, in some cases, market a clearly dangerous level of alcohol as part of the design.  2. The Alcohol Facts should err on the side of more information and greater uniformity between products’ labels. If a consumer is looking at two products’ labels, and one has alcohol content while the other does not, it increases the burden on them to find the needed information.   Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving  1.  We stand with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in pushing for standing servings of alcohol to be included on packaging. Every interpretive step a consumer has to take makes an informed decision more difficult. Currently, USDA and other Federal consumption advice takes the form of a standard drink. 8 Unless there is a cross-agency plan to shift advice to center on fluid oz., the current label still creates challenges to advancing the most impactful outcome from alcohol per serving labeling: avoiding dangerous patterns of consumption.    3. Standard drink should be defined and used in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. This becomes crucial when you get to packaging that does not adhere to the sizes used in Federal advisories. Consumers tend to interpret a “drink,” particularly in the case of non-resealable containers, and this leads to persistent underestimation of the amount of alcohol they are actually consuming.9  For instance, a 16 oz. can at 6.9% ABV could be reflexively considered one drink. However, both because of the high alcohol content and the added volume, it far exceeds that, and two containers of this per night would be well over the hazardous chronic consumption threshold. Research suggests that the reflexive assumption of one “drink” per container can be altered through education,10 but for the TTB label revisions to facilitate that, the information must be standardized and easily referenced against an easily memorized standard—which already exists in the form of the standard drink.  In light of TTB’s concerns with legibility, a conservative alternative would be to provide standard drinks within a range, e.g. “0.5–1 standard drink,” “2-3 standard drinks,” etc.  So long as the upper bound is equal to or greater than the actual number of standard drinks, it would ensure that informed and accurate decisions could be made in terms of health impact.   4. The labels should have a definition of “drink,” as well as a commonly accepted, verifiable risk threshold for chronic harm in terms of drinks per day, that aligns with and can be checked against a reputable source.   5.  As of this writing, preliminary reports are that the United States Department of Agriculture will not be defining hazardous levels of drinking in the forthcoming dietary guidelines. If this is the case, then we recommend defining highly risky drinking according to definitions set forth by NIAAA or a reputable NGO such as the American Medical Association.   Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information  1.  Linear display of Alcohol Facts should be acceptable so long as it is consistent among containers of that size. Allowing producers to choose between two formats, however, would add to consumer confusion and impede the intended benefits to consumers.  2.  A box is a simple and expedient way to standardize the appearance of Alcohol Facts across producers, which should be the goal. While there are other ways to create a readily identifiable standard, the box makes for a straightforward and unambiguous requirement.  3.  We also strongly urge TTB to adopt dimensional limits on type beyond simply font size, since poor kerning or highly condensed fonts (such as those used in the legacy health warning on alcoholic beverages) are extremely difficult to read.  7. Anything other than putting ingredients, nutrition facts, servings per package, and standard drinks per package directly on the bottle is a mistake. QR codes suffer from a number of shortcomings.  First, there are equity concerns about labels that are only visible via smartphone. They assume consumers own smartphone, which, although common, are expensive products and not universal.11 They assume regular access to cellular connection. And they create an additional burden on the consumer to access and compare the information they are seeking. These burdens are not distributed equally, but tend to disproportionately impact individuals in rural areas, those with lower socioeconomic status, and older consumers.   There is a secondary concern that the chain of custody for the Alcohol Facts data becomes increasingly baroque as we begin adding in digital storage. This creates inaccuracies and accountability issues, which not only risk discouraging consumers seeking good information, but in making audits and corrections increasingly more difficult.   Lastly, Alcohol Facts through QR codes contain no guarantees that consumers would not, for instance, have to provide contact information, or be protected from cookies and other web traffic monitoring being enabled on their devices. The simple act of enjoying a consumer’s right to know should never be a channel for surreptitious information harvesting, especially when it regards products for which aggressive, targeted marketing can create serious psychological and physical problems for the consumer.   QR codes, in short, build sizable, gratuitous walls between consumers and the information they deserve, and make consumers more vulnerable to predatory marketing.   9. Electronic disclosure should not be allowed. If it were, however, information with immediate consequences to health should still be on the bottle, including alcohol content, standard drinks, and sugars.  10. Not only would allowing multiple options create consumer confusion, it would undermine the value of universal Alcohol Fact labeling requirements in validating marketing claims. Once again, producers would put on-package labels for products billed as “healthy” while burying the labels for other products on a website.    Serving Size Reference Amounts  1.  The specified fluid ounce/milliliter quantities on the Alcohol Facts labels will be difficult for consumers to picture.9 A graphical explainer, showing how much of a standard wine glass, shot glass, or beer stein each quantity refers to, would be essential. For some categories—especially the 2.5 fl. oz. and 5 fl. oz. sizes—the ABV range covered within in that serving size creates a large discrepancy in standard drinks. For the 2.5 fl. oz. category, the upper bound is the same as a serving of “standard” distilled spirits.  For the 5 fl. oz., however, the upper bound (16% ABV) would be substantially more, as is 12 fl. oz. at 7% ABV.    All of this would be obviated, of course, by using standard drinks. Failing that, the ABV upper bounds for each serving size should be set to be the equivalent of one standard drink.  3. Any flexibility in serving size should come with the obligation to clearly, graphically describe the quantity of that specific alcoholic beverage being referred to.  4. Standard drinks are the only quantity framing which has utility in empowering consumers to engage in healthier behavior. It is correct to say that this does not reflect the way that beverages are consumed. The outcome from that, however, would not be confused consumers, but rather health-motivated consumers eschewing single-serve containers with excessive standard drinks.   Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Display Panel  1. Dual-column nutritional facts in food products have been shown to influence consumption behavior even in individuals not actively looking to change behavior, with non-dieting individuals eating as much as dieting individuals when given dual-column nutritional details.12 As such, TTB should expect that dual-column Alcohol Facts labeling will result in moderated consumption, not in normalizing consuming more servings.  2. Five-plus serving, non-resealable containers definitely exist in the U.S. alcohol market, and are among the most dangerous products sold. Anything that encourages purchasers to consume less than the full quantity should be applauded, and evidence from food studies suggest that dual-column displays should do that.  3. There should be no upper bound on standard servings per container before a dual-column label is used. The obvious threshold should be the nature of the container itself; if a container has more than one serving and is not resealable, it should be expected to carry a dual-column label.  4. Having a vague threshold of 200% of serving reference size before a dual-column label is required may result in the proliferation of packaging that is 199% the size of a regular serving. The easiest way to obviate this is to set the cutoff at 100%.   Again, we are grateful to TTB for undertaking this effort, and for giving us the opportunity to comment. As public understanding of alcohol risk increases, the demand for accessible, accurate information grows as well. While we feel there are still some shortcomings in how alcohol quantities are being conveyed to consumers, this rulemaking will still greatly improve their abilities to take control of their health and wellbeing. We are at your disposal for any input that might help TTB as the final rulemaking takes shape.   Respectfully,

A. INTRODUCTION 
Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) represents the wine companies in the industry and trade in the 
European Union. Its members produce and market the vast majority of quality European wines, with and without 
a geographical indication, and account for over 90% of European wine exports. Micr o and small and medium -
sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU wine sector, representing more than 9 9% of wine 
companies. 
In 2024, European wines accounted for approximately 64% of the volume and 78% of the value of total U.S. wine 
imports. That year, the European Union exported an estimated €4.9 billion worth of wine to the United States . 
This robust transatlantic trade reflects the enduring demand for European wines by US consumers.  
CEEV thanks the US authorities for the opportunity offered to comment on Notice No. 237 (Docket No. TTB -
2025-0002), which proposes mandatory Alcohol Facts Statements on labels of wines, distilled spirits, and malt 
beverages. 
B. CEEV COMMENTS 
CEEV shares TTB’s commitment to enhancing consumer access to product information and promoting informed 
choices. In this spirit, we wish to offer constructive input to ensure that any future labelling requirements take 
into account the specific characteristics of wine and the operational context European wine exporters to the US. 
CEEV believes that certain elements of the TTB’s proposed approach should be adapted to better account for 
wine’s unique characteristics, limited label space, production variability, and the need for alignment with 
international practices, in order to avoi d placing disproportionate burdens on EU wine producers, particularly 
small and medium-sized enterprises. 
In this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: 
 
1. Digital labelling to be authorized for wine Serving Facts disclosure 
Wine is an agricultural product defined by natural variations depending on the characteristics of the harvest. 
Unlike other products, wine is not made to a fixed recipe and its nutritional composition, especially sugar and 
therefore calorie content, can fluctuate significantly depending on climate conditions, fermentation choices, and 
vintage conditions and cannot be known until shortly before the wine is bottled.  
 
Mandatory physical nutritional labelling would place a disproportionate burden on producers, particularly small 
CEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  
Notice No. 237 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages   
 
 
and medium -sized European wineries where wine is often produced in limited batches, with labels printed 
before final composition is confirmed. Requiring precise data would mean repeated testing and reprinting, 
adding significant cost and complexity. For many European wine producers, these obligations could be financially 
unmanageable and may discourage exports to the US, reducing diversity and choice. 
 
Wine labels already carry substantial mandatory information, such as origin, varietal, vintage, and legal 
designations, within limited space. Imposing additional standardized panels would further constrain label design 
and potentially compromise product identity. 
 
In this context, electronic labelling offers a practical and effective solution for communicating nutritional 
information to consumers, particularly in the case of wine. Digital tools such as QR codes printed on the bottle 
enable producers to provide detailed, accurate, and multilingual information in a format that is both accessible 
and adaptable. Consumers can instantly access this content using their smartphones, allowing for a more 
informative experience without compromising the visual integrity or cultural identity of the label. 
For EU wine exporters to the United States, electronic labelling significantly reduces the logistical and financial 
burden associated with traditional on-label disclosures. It allows updates to be made without reprinting labels—
an essential advantage in a sector in which 99% of companies in the EU are micro, small, or medium -sized 
enterprises. 
 
Digital labelling also supports broader policy objectives, including sustainability and accessibility. It reduces 
packaging waste, enables real -time updates, and facilitates access to product information for persons with 
disabilities. It also responds to evolving consumer expectations for digital transparency and allows producers to 
share additional context, such as production methods or responsible consumption messages, without 
compromising essential label elements. 
 
This approach is already established:  
- In the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2021/2117  permits wine and aromati zed wine products  to 
disclose, under certain conditions, mandatory nutritional and ingredient information electronically. 
- Codex Guidelines on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling (CXG 105-2024) 
also consider that mandatory information particulars could be provided to consumers using technology 
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. 
 
CEEV requests the TTB to recogni ze electronic labelling as a valid means of compliance for wine Serving Facts. 
Such recognition would appropriately consider wine and wine production specificities, promote regulatory 
coherence between major wine -producing regions and facilitate smoother trade flows while supporting 
informed consumer choice. 
 
2. Serving Facts – title, content and tolerance 
Since their introduction in 2013, the existing voluntary requirements for providing nutritional information have 
used the heading “Serving Facts”.  For consistency reasons, CEEV believes that this heading shall not be replaced 
with the title “Alcohol Facts”  as proposed in NPRM 237.  
 
Concerning the content of the Serving Facts, CEEV welcomes the fact that TTB is proposing a content of a 
nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what is required for other food 
products.  
 
CEEV welcomes the proposed 20% tolerance level proposed by the TTB for nutritional declaration as it will allow 
the use of typical values for the nutrition declaration.  
  
Finally, CEEV seeks assurance that, considering the proposed tolerance and the minimal presence of fats and  
 
 
proteins in wine, producers will be permitted either to list these components as “0 grams” thereby avoiding 
the expense of laboratory analysis for these two substances. CEEV also suggest TTB to authorize operators to 
include a single statement such as “Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the 
Statement instead of the “0 grams” indication on the table. 
 
3. Alcohol content statement  
CEEV supports the communication of alcohol content for all alcoholic beverages.  
CEEV requests the TTB not to require alcohol content to be expressed in fluid ounces per serving, in order to 
prevent consumer confusion and support harmonization with international wine labeling practices. Both 
national wine laws and international standar ds, such as those of the OIV, states that alcohol content be 
communicated as ABV. Consumers are accustomed to this format across global wine markets and can readily 
interpret the information provided. 
 
4. Implementation period 
CEEV is in favor of the planned five-year phase-in period as an appropriate timing to allow wine companies to 
adapt to the new rules. 
 
5. Certificate of Label Approval applications 
Considering the variability of wine,  CEEV is in favor of the proposed exemption from requiring new COLA when 
the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required Serving Facts statement.

the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
Scantrust 
Scantrust specializes in digital product information solutions, particularly for wine, 
aromatized wine, and spirits. The U-label by Scantrust platform was specifically designed to 
provide economic operators with a reliable and fully compliant solution to meet the latest 
EU requirements on ingredient and nutritional labeling (Regulation (EU) 2021/2117). 
European wine and spirits associations support our solution and assist our teams with 
regulatory monitoring. This partnership ensures full compliance for our clients in meeting 
European and national labeling requirements for wine and spirits. 
Scantrust has also expanded its expertise in traceability and anti-counterfeiting systems. 
Our mission is to facilitate access to clear, complete, and reliable information for all 
consumers, especially in highly regulated sectors such as wine, spirits, food, cosmetics, 
chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 
Purpose 
This contribution aims to support the authorization of digital labeling (e.g., via QR codes or 
digital links) as an acceptable alternative or complement to physical labeling under the 
TTB’s proposed regulations for alcoholic beverage labeling. 
We believe that the digital solution is fully aligned with the TTB's goals to: 
● Increase product transparency and information to consumers, 
● Provide access to reliable, up-to-date, comprehensive information that 
adapts to regulatory changes (including international ones), 
● Enhance consumer choice, 
● Harmonize labeling standards 
Functional and Economic Benefits of Digital Labeling 
1) Regulatory compliance 
Digital labeling ensures compliance with labeling regulations across different 
countries and/or regions of the world and allows adapting products already present 
on the market to new regulations. As a concrete example of this, when Italy and 
Spain have enforced, in 2023 and 2025 respectively, new labeling regulations requiring all products to show clear packaging sorting and recycling instructions, 
users of the U-label by Scantrust solution were able to add these new requirements 
to their digital labels, including to their already existing labels, and show this new 
content whenever the QR code is scanned in Italy or in Spain specifically. Reprinting 
of physical labeling elements was not necessary due to the dynamic nature of the 
content served and accessed with a QR code printed on labels. 
More generally speaking, users of the U-label by Scantrust solution benefit from 
strong expertise and guidance on how to be compliant with the different labeling 
regulations (both existing and future), how to present the information to ensure full 
compliance, etc. thanks to our partnership with the European wine and spirits 
associations. The acceptance of delivery of mandatory particulars by way of digital 
means as permitted by regulation has been successful in terms of implementation 
and positive sentiment. There is a strong argument for a similar approach and 
regulatory support by the TTB.   
2) Instant data updates 
Digital labels allow real-time updates of information such as nutrition declaration 
and ingredients list without having to reprint labels or recall products. This also 
means that producers can instantly correct any mistake or inaccuracy in a digital 
label, at no cost, and with minimum effort. Correcting a mistake on physical labels 
typically entails a problematic and costly process. 
Process-wise, labels with QR codes can be printed even before the content of the 
bottle is finalized (i.e. at any stage of the production process, even before the final 
ingredient list and nutritional values are known), which, in the case of wine and 
aromatized wine products, is often necessary. Unlike other products, wine is not 
made according to a fixed recipe. Its nutritional content depends on many factors 
and evolves all along the production and maturation processes, meaning that its 
final nutritional facts are not known until it is bottled. Thanks to digital labeling, 
producers can anticipate the labeling process by printing their labels in advance, 
then simply updating the digital label content with accurate information when the 
bottles are marketed – or at any point afterwards. 
3) Cost reduction and efficiency 
A single QR code can dynamically direct consumers to specific content based on 
their location and local regulations. This reduces complexity and printing costs for 
producers, especially those exporting to multiple, disparate markets. 
 
4) Extended and enriched information 
Digital platforms mean that provision of mandatory or ancillary product particulars 
are not limited by physical space on a label. More detailed product information can 
be provided: origin, certifications, sustainability, risks, etc. Information can also be 
provided in a more consumer-friendly way. Including all relevant information on the physical back label of a bottle would mean either affixing awkward folded labels or 
reducing the font size to such a minimum that legibility is compromised. None of 
those are concerns with a digital delivery. 
 
5) Multilingual access 
Digital labelling allows producers to provide information in various languages, 
thanks to integrated standardized translation, ensuring that consumers can access 
accurate information in their preferred language. This feature facilitates 
international market access for U.S. wine producers that are just as concerned with 
providing their customers with all relevant product details as they are with being in 
compliance with local regulatory frameworks.  
 
6) Accessibility and inclusiveness 
QR codes, when combined with mobile accessibility features (screen readers, voice 
assistants, AQR), provide improved access for blind or visually impaired users, while 
traditional labels fail to effectively meet these users’ needs. 
Legibility of printed labels is a salient challenge too. According to a widely cited 
structured experiment published in 2011, 61% of consumers presented with some 
sample food labels reported that nutrition information was too small to read. This 
seems consistent with what we know about near-vision changes with age. 
Systematic reviews estimate that 83-89% of US adults over 45 years old have 
presbyopia (PubMed), meaning they have difficulty reading small letters at near 
distances without correction. 
For consumers with serious vision impairment, physical labels are often totally 
unusable. In the US alone, this concerns millions of people: about 7 million people (6 
million with vision loss and 1 million blind), according to CDC’s Vision and Eye 
Health Surveillance System). For these consumers, digital labeling is an opportunity 
to access product information, thanks to screen readers, zoom, high contrast, and 
text-to-speech functionalities. 
On the Issue of Universal Access 
Smartphone penetration currently exceeds 85% in developed countries such as the 
United States. 
According to Pew Research Center’s latest Mobile Fact Sheet published in 2024, 
91% of US adults own a smartphone. Even within lower-income households (below 
$30,000), a large majority of adults (79%) own a smartphone, with 28% of them 
relying on their device for internet access as opposed to a desktop with home 
broadband access. A recent AARP survey, updated in November 2024, reports that nine out of ten 
Americans own a smartphone with 89% of Americans over 50 owning a 
smartphone, compared to 90% among those aged 18-49. 
The recommendation is that digital labels are accessed using QR codes as they do 
not require any specific app—only the camera function or listing of a URL is needed. 
Physical label content may be damaged or unreadable, making digital tools an 
equivalent or even superior alternative. 
Consistency with international (EU) regulation 
Authorizing digital labeling in the US would align with the European Union’s 
regulatory approach. Since December 2023, the EU requires the disclosure of 
nutritional values and ingredients for wine and aromatized wine marketed in the EU 
and explicitly allows this to be done through digital labels  using QR codes. Aligning 
the TTB approach with the EU would provide a harmonized and practical solution 
for export-oriented producers, while significantly reducing compliance costs. Such 
regulatory harmonization would support international trade, avoid redundant 
labeling, lower costs for operators, and foster cooperation between major markets. 
It would also improve predictability for businesses operating in both the U.S. and 
the EU. 
Conclusion 
Digital labeling is a preferred alternative to a strict physical label only policy 
regarding delivery of mandatory particulars for wine and alcohol products. It 
ensures immediate, persistent, and universal access to information, which is 
particularly beneficial for products subject to multiple regulations, and for small-
scale and/or export-oriented producers. 
Data consistently shows high and rising smartphone access in the United States, 
even among older and lower-income adults, seriously undermining the critique that 
digital information is not readily available to all. Physical labeling limitations are 
also increasingly acknowledged, i.e. with widespread near-vision and sight 
impairments that make small prints hard – or impossible – to read and the risk of 
label damage that contributes to illegibility or information loss.  
For all the above, we kindly request TTB to recognize digital labeling as a valid 
means of regulatory compliance for wine and alcohol labeling. Digital labels offer 
precision, cost-effectiveness, inclusivity, and adaptability—key principles of modern 
regulation.

Re: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages

Dear Ms. Greenberg:

Family Winemakers of California is a trade association which advocates for predominately small, family-owned wineries in California – nearly all of whom produce less than 5,000 cases/year.

Celebrating our 35th anniversary this year, our members continue to contribute to the agricultural strength and economies of numerous California communities.

Wine labels currently contain many facts. Among these are: Producer identification, class and type of wine, net contents, sulfite declaration, and other “mandatory” information. If we

include the information that “may” be on a wine label - it becomes evident that space available for additional information would be at a premium – if any space actually remained. Additional information should only be mandatory if it serves a necessary benefit for the consumer. Most of our members rely on direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, which doesn’t require a UPC code.

Even without the UPC code, label space is crowded. QR codes are a consideration, but they are not part of the current proposal in the notice.

QR codes are in common use today and can deliver important information to consumers. Some wineries today have already adopted the use of QR codes to deliver information about their wines - such as specific production methods used, and origin of the wines themselves. If the

TTB adopts this proposal and makes it mandatory, it should allow the information to be delivered via QR code. Further, to maintain consistency in current label format, it should

continue to use the term “Serving Facts” which accurately describes the proposed information.

Family Winemakers of California appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation and is happy to answer any questions you may have about our comments.

FIVS Response to the U.S. Federal Register Notice Regarding Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labelling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
14 August 2025 
 
FIVS appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 
Bureau’s (TTB) Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements.  
FIVS is the international federation for the global wine and associated sectors, advocating for an 
operating environment free from unnecessary and distortive trade barriers. Our membership 
comprises 50 leading wine companies and trade associations from 19 countries, collectively 
accounting for more than 85% of global wine production. 
To support international wine trade and regulatory coherence, FIVS has published a number of 
good regulatory practice frameworks, including: 
1. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2013) 
2. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2016) 
3. Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) (2025) 
These documents address a wide range of regulatory issues and have been welcomed by 
governments as a basis for more efficient and coherent policy, facilitating trade and ensuring 
consumer protection. 
In light of the current consultation, we are pleased to share the FIVS Good Regulatory Principles 
for Electronic Labelling, which outline best practices for using digital tools to communicate both 
mandatory and voluntary labelling information. We respectfully urge TTB to consider the 
consumer benefits and efficiencies offered by e -labelling when evaluating new labelling 
requirements. 
Wine has many unique characteristics that derive from the fact that it is not a recipe product, it is 
an agricultural product grown and produced with each annual vintage having unique impacts on 
the finished pro duct. These characteristics create special challenges for wine producers when 
considering new labelling requirements such as the ones proposed in No. 237. Technologies such 
as QR codes enable producers to manage the variations of each annual harvest (and its impact 
on nutritional content) while providing accurate, up-to-date information with limited disruption to 
their operations . The vast majority of global wine producers  are small and medium sized 
companies and this approach is particularly valuable in helping to reduce compliance costs 
without compromising consumer access to information. 
In the European Union, wine producers are already permitted to communicate certain mandatory 
information—such as ingredients and nutritional data —via QR codes. FIVS supports a balanced 
approach, recognizing that some mandatory information (e.g., allergen w arnings) should remain on the physical label. E -labelling is not a replacement but a complement to physical labels, 
enhancing consumer understanding and choice through modern, accessible means. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) 
14 March 2025 
The following sets forth principles and best practices policymakers should consider when 
allowing the use of electronic means for the presentation of voluntary and mandatory labelling 
information to consumers.   
These principles and best practices build on two previous sets of FIVS ’ “
Principles to Enhance 
Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine ” and reflect growing trends i n the voluntary or 
mandatory disclosure of information via electronic means beyond what is included on the 
physical wine label.  For the purposes of this document, “e-labelling”, “digital means” or “digital 
presentation” refer to  the voluntary or mandatory 1 disclosure of information via electronic 
means such as using a scannable code that creates a bridge from the physical label to the e-
label. 
Use of technology to provide for  the digital presentation of some mandatory information is an 
emerging area particularly relevant to wine producers. Wine is not a recipe or formula product.  
In contrast with other food products, the ingredients and related nutritional values in wine can 
vary from vintage to vintage due to variations in climate and grape growing conditions.  In some 
cases, ﬁnal ingredients may not be known until just before bottling whereas the physical label is 
designed and typically printed months in advance of bottling due to the regulatory nature of key 
information on wine labels and label pre -approvals required in some markets .  The use of e-
labels for the digital presentation of ingredients and nutrition information permits the ﬂexibility 
needed while still enabling product accuracy.   
 
However, the use of e-labels should not be restricted only to this speciﬁc and narrow use.  
Consumers want more product information tha n can reasonably ﬁ t on physical labels and a 
single QR code can serve multiple purposes . In some jurisdictions, QR codes have already 
replaced barcodes at the retail level
2 and technology exists for the use of a single QR code to 
transmit different information depending on the type of scanner used.   
 
Here are just a few examples of the type of information currently accessible via a single QR code 
as well as potential future uses.  
 
• Consumers - voluntary product details, sustainability information, product recalls, and 
more. 
• Retailers - point of sale pricing, stocking, and inventory information. 
• Government Officials - mandatory regulatory information, recycling information, and 
export documentation.

QR codes are the most common digital means being used at this time to connect to an e-label.  
While future advancements in technology may lead to replacement s for QR code s, these  
principles will still apply to the use of such replacements. 
1. Use of e -labelling to provide information to wine consumers : 
Governments should permit the use of e- labelling to provide 
information to consumers.   
Recent work in both Codex Alimentarius3 and the International Organi sation of Vine  and Wine 
(OIV) 4  illustrates the growing trend of the use of e-labels to provide some mandatory information 
for food products, including wine. The following are just a few of the reasons that support the ir 
use: 
• Rapidly increasing global penetration of smartphones; 
• Widespread and growing consumer use of QR codes to access information; 
• Consumer demand for more product transparency; 
• Reduced waste consistent with wine industry sustainability goals as the use of e -labels 
reduces label re-prints; 
• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired; and 
• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer - in real time - which is 
not possible using physical labels.  
2. Presentation of certain mandatory information  using digital 
means: Governments should  allow the presentation of certain 
mandatory information via e-labels.     
The European Union (EU) recently took this approach for ingredient and nutrition labelling of 
wine and aromatized wine products5 as did Italy6 and Spain7 for recycling information8 and other 
countries are assessing the introduction of their use in national legislation. 
 
3Guidelines for the use of Technology to Provide Food Information in Food Labeling as agreed to at the 47th Session 
of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)). 
4 The recently updated “OIV International Standard for Labelling of Wines-e-label, nutrient declaration, information 
about ingredients” (amended by resolution ECO DROCON 20-6 76) incorporates many of the FIVS principles. Note 
especially the ability to use a language -free modality: “The direct link to the e -label indicated on the label may be 
clearly identiﬁed through language free presentation modalities, a pictogram or a symbol easily visible and clear to 
understand by consumers.”

The range of possible uses of QR codes to present some information digitally is expected to 
expand over time. Governments should remain flexible and open to allowing digital presentation 
of certain mandatory information as appropriate.    
The same general principles of food labelling regulation such as legibility, truthfulness, and 
accuracy should apply whe ther mandatory information is presented on a physical label or via 
digital means.  
These principles recognize that some mandatory information will  always be on the physical 
label, such as for allergens. A digital label does not replace, but rather supplements, a physical 
label. 
3. Use of QR codes to communicate other, voluntary information: 
Governments should  permit additional, voluntary information to 
be presented via e-labels.   
The same QR code that links to mandatory information should also be permitted to link to 
voluntary information, p rovided that  it is presented separately and distinctly from the 
mandatory information.  
It may be appropriate to allow producers to include a link on the e -label at the end of the 
mandatory information inviting consumers to “click here” should  they desire access to 
additional voluntary information.   
4. The number  of QR codes on a given label should be 
minimized: Governments should permit a single QR code on a 
wine label to serve more than one purpose.  
A single QR code has nearly unlimited uses. 
In some jurisdictions, a single QR code is already being used for product pricing at the point of 
sale, to convey mandatory EU nutrition and ingredient requirements for wine, and to 
communicate EU Member State specific recycling requirements. 
In the United States, many food and beverage companies use a single QR code on a voluntary 
basis to provide information about ingredients, nutrition, and how to properly recycle the 
product based on the consumer’s location

Allowing a single QR code for voluntary and mandatory purposes will maximize its benefit and 
will avoid confusion about which QR code to scan for additional information. 
5. Acceptance of standalone QR codes to c onvey information: 
Governments should refrain from requiring additional text on the 
physical label to identify the information accessible via the QR 
code. 
QR Codes provide for a language -free system of conveying important information and 
consumers are comfortable scanning the codes to access that information.    
Using terms next to the QR code to identify the information on the e-label should be avoided  
because: 
• As the use of QR codes expands , the number of possible terms and languages 
needed to correctly identify the content will proliferate. 
• Text, or other design elements, too close or within the QR code can corrupt the code 
risking its readability10 
If it is deemed essential to identify the mandatory information accessible via the QR code , a 
globally recognized, language-free symbol or pictogram should be utilized.  However, this must 
not interfere with the ability to successfully scan the code. 
6. Expiration of e -labels: When mandatory information is 
provided via an e -label, governments should not require that 
the information remain accessible longer than the wine is 
ordinarily intended for consumption.  
Codex Alimentarius recently agreed to “Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food 
Information in Food Labelling11 that address the timeframe for which producers are expected to 
ensure that information that is accessed via QR codes remains available.  The Guidelines apply 
to pre-packaged foods, including wine.  
Governments are requested to refer to the Guidelines rather than implementing new or 
divergent requirements .  H owever, consideration should be given to adapting them in the 
 
10 ISO/IEC 18004:2024(en), Information technology — Automatic identiﬁcation and data capture techniques — QR 
code bar code symbology speciﬁcation- S ee 5.3.8 “Quiet Zone” that designates the clear space needed 
surrounding the QR code to separate it from nearby design elements or markings to ensure the QR codes 
readability.

Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)).

context of long shelf-life products such as wine to focus on the time period for which the product 
is ordinarily intended for consumption. 
The final Guidelines at section 7.5 state, “Where mandatory food information is solely provided 
using technology, the food information shall be available for at least the period, established 
under intended conditions of distribution, storage, retail and use, that the food would remain 
safe and suit able for sale, consumption or use. For pre- packaged food that is labelled with a 
use-by date or expiration date, this means for at least the period up to and including this date.” 
7. E-labels should comply with applicable data  privacy laws:   
In formulating regulations for the e-labelling of food products, 
governments should take fully into consideration any existing 
and applicable data privacy laws. 
Many countries, including those that allow the use of e-labe ls, have data privacy laws in place 
to protect consumer data or prohibit its collection without affirmative consent. Thus, 
governments should remain mindful of these laws to avoid duplication, contradiction, or overly 
restrictive rules specific to e-labelling.   
8. Harmonized approach: Governments should work towards a 
harmonized international understanding concerning the types of 
information that must appear on the physical label of a wine bottle 
and that which may appear on an e-label.   
Wine is traded all around the world and e-labelling technology is already being used in multiple 
markets.   
In order to facilitate international trade, g overnments are requested to remain flexible in their 
approach and to consider the best practices already in place in key wine producing markets 
before developing regulations in this area.

According to accredited laboratory services (e.g., ETS Laboratories), the analyses required for each nutrient parameter cost hundreds of dollars per label annually. For small, family-owned wineries operating on extremely tight margins, these recurring costs represent an unsustainable financial burden.<br/><br/>Unlike other industries, alcoholic beverage producers face compounded compliance pressures due to a regulatory environment spanning both TTB and FDA jurisdictions. This dual compliance further multiplies costs and administrative complexity, invariably impacting label design, production timelines, and consumer pricing.<br/><br/>The economic consequences extend beyond wineries themselves. Our rural communities depend on the health of these agricultural enterprises. Tourism, hospitality, restaurants, and supplementary agritourism venues rely heavily on winery-generated commerce.

According to accredited laboratory services (e.g., ETS Laboratories), the analyses required for each nutrient parameter cost hundreds of dollars per label annually. For small, family-owned wineries operating on extremely tight margins, these recurring costs represent an unsustainable financial burden.<br/><br/>Unlike other industries, alcoholic beverage producers face compounded compliance pressures due to a regulatory environment spanning both TTB and FDA jurisdictions. This dual compliance further multiplies costs and administrative complexity, invariably impacting label design, production timelines, and consumer pricing.<br/><br/>The economic consequences extend beyond wineries themselves.

The Honorable Mary G. Ryan

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau 
Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division  
1310 G Street, NW, Box 12  
Washington, DC  20005 
 
Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  
(RIN 1513–AC93) 
 
Dear Administrator Ryan: 
 
On behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I 
appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (ATTB) 
proposed rule entitled “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages” (RIN 1513–AC93). We commend the ATTB for its thorough review and recognizing the 
importance of transparency for consumers on serving size and ingredient contents. As the body of 
scientific evidence grows on the impact of alcohol on health conditions such as cancer, it is imperative to 
make this information available in an easy to comprehend format.  
 
Since 2013, alcohol companies have printed versions of a facts label on some of their products. This 
voluntary action lacks uniform guidance, visuals, content, or graphic depictions, and often uses terms like 
“no added sugar” or “gluten free.” These could be interpreted as suggesting that alcoholic beverages have 
nutritional value. The AMA commends the ATTB for promulgating rules with mandatory label 
requirements that provide consumers with consistent information across products. 
 
The AMA has long-standing policies on the impact of alcohol consumption on health and restrictions on 
marketing alcohol to adolescents. Provisions in this rule align with AMA’s initiatives to improve 
consumer access to reliable health information. The AMA generally supports many of the proposals in 
this rule and offers some additional recommendations that would further advance consumer protections 
when it comes to consuming alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) products, including requiring that alcohol fact 
statements include a warning about the link between alcohol and cancer, as outlined in greater detail 
below.  
 
Nutritional Information  
 
The AMA agrees with the ATTB’s proposed mandatory requirement of a uniform alcohol facts 
label that includes a standard set of information across all alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. It 
is important for consumers to understand the health impacts of these beverages and be able to compare 
beverage choices.  
 
The AMA supports ATTB’s proposal that mandatory nutrient information statement on labels must 
include the following information: serving size, servings per container, alcohol content as a percentage of The Honorable Mary G. Ryan 
August 14, 2025 
Page 2 
 
 
  
alcohol by volume and per serving size, calories per serving, and carbohydrates and fat per serving. This 
nutrient information will provide consumers with valuable information about how the products they are 
consuming will impact their diet and overall health, just as the nutritional facts label does with food 
products. This is especially important as the selection of alcoholic beverages marketed to consumers has 
evolved in recent years to include products that are high in added sugars and other additives. For example, 
ready-to drink cocktails are among the fastest growing category of spirits, with sales revenue in the U.S. 
growing by 26.8 percent from 2022 to 2023.1   
 
The ATTB proposes allowing sugar content statements as an optional element and does not propose to 
include sodium or cholesterol because they are generally present in small amounts in alcoholic beverages. 
The AMA believes that sugars, sodium, and cholesterol should be mandatory elements on the 
alcohol facts label. To align the alcohol facts label with the nutrition facts label and provide consumers 
with essential and comprehensive information, sugars, including those that are added, are an essential 
component. Sugars contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and can exacerbate 
existing CVD. Alcoholic beverages can also contain high levels of carbohydrates and sodium. For 
consumers to successfully limit these nutrients, as recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines, this 
information must be accessible on labels.  
 
The AMA supports consistent labeling requirements for “non-alcoholic” or “zero proof” beverages 
that are manufactured, packaged, or marketed in a manner similar to alcoholic beverages. 
Requiring that these products have the same alcohol facts labeling requirements will contribute to 
increased consumer awareness about the dietary impact of these products, which are increasingly 
becoming a popular replacement for alcohol products.1 Non-alcoholic beverages are also attractive to 
adolescents when marketed as an alternative to alcohol with the same taste.2 This labeling consistency is 
important for adolescents to build good habits comparing this type of nutrition information. 
 
The ATTB proposes to allow for the optional presentation of Alcohol Facts panels in a dual-column 
format in which the first column would provide the information for the standard reference serving size, 
while the second column would provide information about the contents of the entire container. The AMA 
believes there would be value in making this mandatory. The dual-column format would provide 
important contextual information and ensure that consumers would be familiar with this format as it 
would be consistent with nutrition facts label requirements.  
 
Title and Display 
 
The ATTB is considering both “Serving Facts” and “Alcohol Facts” as options for the title of the label. 
The AMA recommends that the ATTB use the “Alcohol Facts” title. This title uses the same naming 
convention as the Nutrition Facts label. ATTB could take advantage of existing consumer awareness 
about the use and benefit of such labels by adapting the education and dissemination strategies deployed 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and public health groups including the AMA.3

The AMA understands that the ATTB considered allowing the Alcohol Facts panel to be distributed by 
electronic means that would allow for limiting the information printed on the product label. The AMA 
recommends that the ATTB not allow this form of distribution at the expense of complete and 
thorough information on the product itself. While QR codes and websites can be a useful way to 
provide more detailed nutritional information than traditional labels, research suggests that many 
consumers may not actively use them—due to factors such as convenience, usability, perceived value, 
and online accessibility.4,5 The AMA supports the ATTB’s decision to instead require that this 
information be directly displayed on the product label itself. 
 
To support greater consumer comprehension of the purpose of an alcohol facts label, the AMA 
recommends the use of a panel as opposed to linear format. Panel-style ingredient labels are 
consistently easier for consumers to read and understand, regardless of the type of product, due to their 
structured and standardized layout6 and consumers are already familiar with this format due to the 
nutrition facts label. 
 
ATTB is proposing that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements mirror existing 
type size requirements for mandatory information in the wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverage 
regulations. The AMA supports evidence-based minimum type size requirements to ensure the 
information is presented in a clear, legible format to consumers. The AMA also calls for alcohol 
labeling presented with sufficient prominence, legibility, and design features, such as minimum font size, 
and color contrast, and optional pictorial elements, to enhance readability and support informed decision-
making across populations. To this end, the AMA recommends that the ATTB utilize a multifaceted 
qualitative evaluation process including consumer focus groups to understand which design 
elements are most effective at relaying key information on alcohol beverages. Upon completion of 
this evaluative process, the ATTB should release guidance/examples and possible rulemaking with 
additional requirements based on these findings, such as required color schemes and/or pictorial elements. 
The FDA employed this process in the creation of final regulations for front-of-package nutrition labeling 
and tobacco warning labels. Both were shaped by rigorous, evidence-based research, including consumer 
focus groups, to ensure clear and effective health communication. The FDA relied on this body of 
research to inform its regulations and guidance that empower consumers to make informed decisions and 
advance population health outcomes.  
 
Compliance Date 
 
CMS proposes a compliance deadline of five years from the date of publication in the Federal Register. 
While the AMA understands the desire to allow a reasonable runway, particularly for small 
manufacturers, to come into compliance, we believe five years is an unnecessarily long time and would 
recommend an alternative deadline of two or three years to come into compliance with the rule, which we 
believe would provide more than adequate time for suppliers to come into compliance. In any case, ATTB 
should not finalize a deadline of any longer than five years.  
 
Additional Recommendations 
 
The AMA supports the addition of the following warning statement: “There is no safe amount of 
alcohol consumption, and consuming alcohol in any amount increases the risk of cancer and other

illnesses.” This statement is supported by The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of 
Underage Drinking’s Alcohol Intake and Health draft report and The National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine’s Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health report. These reports were 
assigned by the Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as the evidence 
base needed to develop alcohol consumption recommendations in the final 2025 guidelines.7,8 
Observational and meta-analysis reviews have all confirmed the known link between alcohol 
consumption and cancers.9,10 Despite additional evidence presented in the U.S. Surgeon General’s 
Advisory on Alcohol and Cancer Risk, less than half of U.S. adults are aware of the link between alcohol 
use and cancer.11,12 Ideally, this warning statement would be placed on the front of package label. In 
addition to package labeling, the AMA recommends clear, evidence-based point-of-sale warning signage 
in physical and digital retail environments. 
 
Lastly, the AMA strongly supports ongoing research and evaluation into the impact of alcohol warning 
labels on consumer knowledge and behavior, health outcomes, and alcohol sales patterns, particularly 
across sub-populations, and that alcohol labeling standards be updated based on the latest in evolving 
evidence about what consumer education strategies are most effective.  
 
In Conclusion 
 
Overall, the AMA strongly supports the creation of an alcohol facts statement, which will lead to greater 
consumer understanding about the associated dietary and health impacts of consuming alcoholic products. 
We welcome further opportunities to collaborate with the ATTB as it works towards finalization and 
implementation of these new requirements which will help empower Americans to more easily compare 
products and make well-informed decisions. Please reach out to me directly at 312-464-5288 or

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) respectfully submits the following 
comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rule on 
alcohol facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. CSPI is a 
non-profit consumer education and advocacy organization that has worked since 1971 to 
improve the public’s health through better nutrition and safer food. CSPI publishes Nutrition 
Action and is supported by the subscribers to Nutrition Action, individual donors, and foundation 
grants. CSPI is an independent organization that does not accept any corporate donations. 
 
Overall, we support this rule as a major step forward for transparency on alcoholic beverages that 
will allow consumers to make more informed choices about their alcohol purchases and TTB 
should move swiftly to finalize this rule. However, consumers need more information about 
nutrition and alcohol content beyond what has been proposed.  
 
Background 
 
CSPI has a long history of advocating for greater transparency on alcohol and has called for 
alcohol content and nutrition information labeling for over two decades. In 2003, CSPI, the 
National Consumers League (NCL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and 66 other 
health and consumer organizations filed a citizen petition calling on TTB’s predecessor to 
require a standardized “Alcohol Facts” label (including percent alcohol by volume (%ABV), 
serving size, amount of alcohol per serving, servings per container, calories, ingredients, and the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) advice on moderate drinking) on all beer, wine, and 
distilled spirits.
1 In 2005, TTB requested public comments on alcohol labeling,2 and in 2007, 
TTB issued proposed rules for mandatory “Serving Facts,”3 but these rules were never finalized. 
Instead, in 2013, TTB published a ruling allowing voluntary nutrition and alcohol content 
labeling.
4 In October 2022, CSPI, NCL, and CFA filed a lawsuit demanding a long-overdue 
response to our 19-year-old citizen petition.5  
 
The proposed rule, published by TTB in January 2025, would require an “Alcohol Facts” 
statement to be present on all TTB-regulated alcoholic products. The proposed “Alcohol Facts” 
panel includes “alcohol content expressed both as a percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of calories, and the number, in grams, of 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”
6 It also allows for a sugar content statement as an 
optional aspect of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. The rule establishes “tolerance ranges” for each    
 
2 
 
“Alcohol Facts” panel element, including updates to %ABV tolerance ranges and allows the 
“Alcohol Facts” statement to be provided in either block or linear format and in either a vertical 
or horizontal position. Additionally, it sets forth serving size reference amounts, some additional 
formatting requirements/options, including optional dual-column labeling. The rule specifies that 
this information must appear on-package and that provision of this information solely via QR 
code is not allowed. 
Position Summary 
 
In this comment, we convey the following main points:  
• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include serving size, servings per 
container, %ABV, and calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in grams. The disclosure 
should also include total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, 
sodium in milligrams, percent Daily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, 
number of standard drinks per container (instead of the proposed number of fluid ounces 
of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), the conversion between standard drinks and fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and specific, actionable moderate drinking advice (see, e.g., 
Figure 1 below). We refer to the above elements as: CSPI’s Proposed Alcohol “Serving 
Facts” Label. 
• We agree with the proposed serving size reference amounts and the proposal that 
containers with less than 200% of a single serving should be labeled as a single serving.  
• We disagree with the decision to make dual-column labeling voluntary. Dual-column 
labeling should be mandatory to further assist consumers in understanding the contents of 
alcohol products they purchase. 
• We disagree with the proposed 5-year compliance period. TTB should adopt a shorter 
compliance period of 3.5 years, as this would strike a better balance between providing 
consumers with information they require and minimizing cost to industry. 
• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure should be required to appear on-package 
and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this 
would place a barrier between consumers and this vital information and specifically 
disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology 
(e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land).

Our detailed comments are as follows:  
 
1) Improving alcohol labeling is a commonsense approach for promoting transparency, 
health, and safety. 
 
Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various harms including injuries,
7 motor vehicle 
accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.8 Alcohol is also calorie-
dense and on average accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.9 Many alcoholic 
beverages also contain carbohydrates, sugars, and other nutrients to limit. All other products we 
consume have basic nutrient, calorie, food allergen, and ingredients information.  
 
Alcohol content labeling is a simple tool that increases consumer awareness of the contents of 
alcoholic beverages
10 and could potentially impact drinking behavior.11 Many alcohol industry 
members are willing and able to label their products, as evidenced by the wide adoption of the 
Brewers’ Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which has resulted in 95% of the beer (by volume) of 
the top beer brands voluntarily providing nutrition information on their labels.12 
 
Recent polling shows that the majority of consumers want access to alcohol content and nutrition 
information and would find it helpful when making purchasing decisions about alcoholic 
beverages.13 In March 2024, Big Village’s CARAVAN U.S. Online Omnibus Survey 
(commissioned by CSPI) was administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, 
demographically balanced to represent the U.S. Census on age, sex, geographical region, race, 
and ethnicity. Of the 1,924 respondents, 1,509 (78%) reported consuming a drink containing 
alcohol in the past year. Of those who reported consuming at least one drink in the past year, a 
majority said they either strongly support or somewhat support policies to require alcohol 
content (77%), serving size (67%), calorie content (66%), and nutritional content (64%) 
information on alcohol labels. Arming consumers with this additional information would help 
them make comparisons between products and could increase competition in the marketplace. 
 
Manufacturers are currently allowed to provide alcohol content and nutrition information on a 
voluntary basis, but uptake is low and uneven across products. CSPI conducted an analysis, 
published in 2023, of available labels from the top 150 beer brands (of which 65 brands had 
labels available) and top 100 wine brands (of which 67 brands had labels available) by 2020 
sales volume. The analysis found that the statement of average analysis, which contains calories, 
carbohydrates, protein, and fat, was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.
14 The 
voluntary “Alcohol Facts” label, which includes %ABV, serving size, servings per container, and 
per-serving and per-container information about fluid ounces of alcohol, was present on only 2% 
of beer and 0% of wine labels. Even when this information was present, on most labels it was 
presented in formatting that poses a challenge to consumers, such as vertical layout (62%), 
continuous format (95%), and use of all uppercase letters and a crowded layout (60%).  
 
Below, we provide input on selected questions posed by TTB in its proposed rule, with an 
emphasis on the importance of mandatory, comprehensive, on-package labeling.

2) “Serving Facts” is the preferable title for the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether the title “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts” best describes 
the information provided. While either option is acceptable, “Serving Facts” is preferable, as it 
indicates that it is providing per-serving information and has the added benefit of implying that 
the information may not just be about the alcohol content, but about other ingredients as well. 
This is also aligned with how consumers are accustomed to finding this information on alcohol 
products, as the voluntary statement of average analysis is titled “Serving Facts.”  
 
3) The proposed serving size reference amounts are appropriate. 
 
The proposed “Alcohol Facts” panel bases serving size on the serving sizes provided in the TTB 
Ruling 2013-2 (see Figure 3).
4 TTB is soliciting feedback on the appropriateness of these 
serving size reference amounts compared to those in a previous ruling (TTB ruling 2004-1). We 
agree that these reference amounts are appropriate. However, to avoid consumer confusion they 
must be combined with the requirement, which TTB has proposed, that containers with up to 
200% of a serving be labeled as a single serving, plus mandatory dual-column labeling for 
containers with up to 500% of a single serving (TTB has proposed optional dual column 
labeling) (see section 6 below). These three things combined will facilitate optimal consumer 
understanding of the content of each product.  
 
Figure 3. Serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 
 
Source: TTB Ruling 2013-2: Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/2013 -2.pdf 
 
The serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 are appropriate because they account for the 
fact that alcoholic beverages come in a wide variety of strengths, even across alcohol types. An 
earlier 2004 ruling by TTB, which set forth serving sizes of 1.5 fluid ounces for distilled spirits, 
5 fluid ounces for wines, and 12 fluid ounces for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol 
content,15 lacks the nuance needed to account for the wide variety of products on the market. For 
example, under the 2004 rule, both unfortified wine and fortified wines would have a 5 ounce 
serving, despite the fact that fortified wines can contain up to 25% ABV and have an average of 
18% ABV compared to an average of 12% ABV for unfortified wines.16 While unfortified wine 
is typically served in 5-ounce pours, fortified wines are typically served in 3-ounce pours,17 
which better aligns to the 2013 serving sizes. Additionally, as the 2013 ruling points out,4 under 
the 2004 ruling, the serving size for distilled spirits (which are in a canned cocktail) would be 1.5 
ounces regardless of %ABV of the full product. But, unlike pure distilled spirits, canned 
   
 
6 
 
cocktails are commonly consumed in 12-ounce cans and, by nature of being diluted with mixer, 
often have a far lower %ABV. The serving sizes put forth in the 2013 ruling are the better option 
because they account for variations in strength within each alcohol category and generally align 
better with how these beverages are typically consumed (i.e., higher %ABV beverages tend to be 
offered in smaller servings). 
 
One drawback to the 2013 serving sizes, that can be offset by dual-column labeling, is that if a 
consumer fails to notice that a higher %ABV products has a smaller serving size when 
comparing to a lower %ABV product the high %ABV product could appear to be the lower 
calorie option, when in fact it would have more calories if consumed in equal amounts. Because 
the proposed serving sizes are the best option but will not always perfectly align with how 
beverages are consumed, dual-column labeling should be mandatory when a container holds up 
to 500% of a single serving (see section 6).   
 
TTB is also soliciting feedback on making the serving size reference amount equal to an 
alcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, but this does not align with the way in 
which these beverages are typically consumed and would be confusing. For example, unfortified 
wine is usually served in a 5-ounce pour, regardless of %ABV. If the serving size for the Alcohol 
Facts panel were made equal to 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, a 7% ABV wine would have an 8.6-
ounce serving size and a 16% ABV wine would have a 3.8-ounce serving size. Even with 
rounding, this might make it difficult for consumers to estimate nutrition and alcohol serving 
information for the amount that they are actually consuming. 
 
4) Dual-column labeling should be mandatory and containers with less than 200% of a 
serving should be labeled as a single serving. 
 
We agree with the proposed requirement that beverages packaged in containers with less than 
200% of a single serving size reference amount be labeled as a single serving. This will result in 
more containers that are commonly consumed on a single occasion being labeled as a single 
serving. For example, a 16-ounce 4.2% ABV Bud Light
18 can that contains 133% of a 12-ounce 
serving would simply be labeled as one serving. 
 
If the product contains multiple servings, the label should also state the number of servings per 
container and dual-column labeling should be mandatory. The number of standard drinks should 
be listed per serving and per container (see Fig. 3 below). TTB’s proposed rule allows voluntary 
dual-column labeling for containers of up to five servings. This differs from FDA’s dual-column 
labeling approach, which is mandatory and applies to products containing more than two and up 
to three servings per container.19 Mandatory dual-column labeling is important to prevent 
consumer confusion that may arise from basing serving size for alcohol on %ABV. For example, 
in Figure 4, both Guinness beers are in 12-ounce bottles, but the Extra Stout has a 12-ounce 
serving size and the Foreign Extra Stout has a 5-ounce serving size due to its higher %ABV. If 
calorie information is given solely per serving, the Foreign Extra stout would appear to have 
fewer calories, but the dual-column labeling makes it clear that the whole bottle contains more 
calories.

TTB should require dual column labeling on products containing up to 5 servings and allow 
voluntary dual-column labeling on products containing more than 5 servings. Requiring dual-
column labeling on products with up to five servings is important to clearly communicate the 
nutrition and alcohol content on alcoholic beverages that are often consumed in one sitting but 
packaged in non-resealable containers up to 5 servings. For example, “Voodoo Ranger,” an 
imperial IPA of 9% ABV from New Belgium brewery, can be found in 19.2-ounce cans.20 Based 
on the proposed reference serving size of 5 ounces, each can contains approximately 4 servings, 
but it is not resealable.  
 
Dual-column labeling should additionally be voluntary on containers larger than 5 servings, as 
this will allow manufacturers to provide more information to consumers. This may be especially 
useful in rare cases where the manufacturer may have an expectation that more than 5 servings 
are likely to be consumed in a single sitting, such as when an unusually high %ABV beer is sold 
in larger sized cans and bottles. For example, Evil Twin 120 Days Dry Aged Stout is 17.5% 
ABV and sold in pint sized cans.21 With a 2.5-ounce serving size, it has 6.4 servings and is not 
resealable. Optional dual column labeling would be useful on products such as these to further 
inform the consumer.

TTB asks whether consumers might interpret dual-column labeling as a recommendation to drink 
a whole container. A consumer’s decision to consume an entire container may be influenced by 
multiple factors, including the container design, the environment in which the container is 
purchased and consumed, and product marketing. We are not aware of any studies indicating that 
dual-column labeling independently influences consumers’ risk of consuming an entire 
container, and such labeling provides additional information to consumers, which may be useful 
in informing purchasing and consumption decisions. We therefore find no strong rationale for 
preventing this form of labeling as a voluntary practice. Inclusion of additional information, such 
as the number of standard drinks and the footnote with specific, actionable moderate drinking 
guidelines (discussed above), could further prevent this confusion. TTB could also consider 
requiring an additional footnote explaining that the dual-column label does not mean that the 
container is meant to be consumed in one sitting. While such a footnote is not required by FDA, 
overconsumption of alcohol has more severe consequences. 
 
5) Alcohol Content Information 
 
Most adults who drink support mandatory alcohol content labeling and believe this information 
is important for making purchasing decisions. As mentioned above, a poll of U.S. adults who 
drink alcohol found that 77% of respondents support policies to require alcohol content 
information on alcohol labels and 90% indicated that it was at least “somewhat important” when 
making alcohol purchasing decisions (with 39% ranking it as “extremely important”).
13 
Currently, this information is not required on all alcoholic beverages and when present can be 
difficult to find. 
 
Data from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show 
that approximately 9% of adults drank in excess of DGA recommendations.22 A literature review 
found that consumers tend to pour larger drinks when asked to estimate a standard drink, and 
struggle to use %ABV and pour size to estimate their intake.23 Alcohol content information, such 
as standard drinks, can help improve consumer awareness of the amount of alcohol they are 
consuming.10,23 
 
a. Consumers need more information on alcohol content than the proposed 
mandatory statement of fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. 
 
The proposed rule requires a statement of the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in 
the “Alcohol Facts” statement. Under the current labeling system, if a consumer wants to know 
how many standard drinks are in a product, they must use the %ABV to calculate fluid ounces of 
pure ethyl alcohol and then divide by 0.6. Under the proposed labeling system, which would 
require the number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, gets consumers one step closer to the 
information they want. However, fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol will likely not be useful to 
consumers as they are unlikely to know that 0.6 fluid ounces of pure ethanol equals a standard 
drink.23 In addition, even if the conversion is provided, converting this information into standard 
drinks still requires consumers to perform division using decimal fractions. A 2024 report from 
the National Center for Education Statistics found that about one third of U.S. adults tested 
lacked the skills necessary to perform calculations using decimals and fractions.
24,25 Fluid ounce 
information is therefore unlikely to be useful or material to consumers in making purchasing and    
 
9 
 
consumption decisions, particularly if those decisions are being made under a state of 
intoxication.  
 
Instead, to improve the ability of consumers to understand the amount of alcohol they are 
consuming, the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include the number of standard drinks per serving 
and a footnote stating, “A standard drink contains 0.6 fl oz of pure alcohol.” This would be better 
understood than the amount of alcohol in fluid ounces, as most public health advice is framed 
around “standard drinks,” so consumers are likely more familiar with this concept. When 
standard drinks and serving size are equivalent (as will be the case for many distilled products) 
this information could be combined into one line reading “serving/standard drink size” to save 
space. 
 
For additional context, the footnote should also include specific, actionable moderate drinking 
advice, such as the statement: “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults 
who choose to drink should limit intake to two standard drinks or less in a day for men and one 
standard drink or less in a day for women (on days when alcohol is consumed)”
26 in bold, as 
illustrated in Figure 1 (above). 
 
Consumers can only follow moderate drinking advice to the extent they are aware of it and 
including it on the label of alcoholic beverages would improve awareness while also providing a 
frame of reference for the standard drink information. Research shows that consumers respond 
best to a combination of types of alcohol content information. An experimental study found that 
labels that include both standard drink information and low-risk drinking guidelines helped 
participants more accurately estimate the amount of alcohol in a standard drink, the number of 
standard drinks in a container, and how many drinks could be consumed before reaching the low-
risk drinking limit, compared to labels that only included %ABV.
27  
 
A combination of mandatory standard drinks, a conversion factor explaining what counts as a 
standard drink, plus specific, actionable moderate drinking guidelines would best provide 
consumers with information that they can utilize in purchasing decisions and could reduce the 
risk of overconsumption leading to alcohol-related injury and death.   
 
b. The alcohol content statement should be part of the “Alcohol Facts” Statement. 
 
We agree with TTB’s proposal to require the alcohol content statement be part of the “Alcohol 
Facts” statement. Alcohol content statements are used by consumers to make decisions about 
what and how much to drink. When consumers have easy access to this information, they can 
make more informed purchasing and consumption choices that can ultimately prevent accidents 
and deaths that would have resulted from unintentional excess consumption. As mentioned 
above, polling data show that consumers desire this information to inform purchasing decisions, 
but for consumers to be informed they need to first notice and understand this information. To 
increase the likelihood that consumers notice this information, it should be a mandatory part of 
the “Alcohol Facts” statement. 
 
 
    
 
10 
 
6) In addition to the nutrition elements proposed, consumers need sugar, added sugar, 
saturated fat, and sodium information included on the “Alcohol Facts” label. 
 
When providing nutrition information on alcoholic beverages, it is important to inform 
consumers of nutrients of concern but to avoid highlighting positive nutrients in a manner that 
could mislead consumers into purchasing alcohol based on a false belief that alcohol is an 
important source of nutrition. Alcohol is a carcinogen, and increased intake increases the risk of 
multiple cancers.28 Additionally, alcohol consumption at high levels has been shown to decrease 
absorption of various micronutrients, including thiamine and folate, by changing how they are 
absorbed in the digestive tract.29 While the main health risk from drinking alcohol is the alcohol 
itself, alcohol is also a substantial contributor to average daily calorie intake for those who drink 
it,9 and can be high in nutrients of concern, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and even sodium. 
These nutrients to limit should be highlighted to improve consumers’ ability to make informed 
purchasing decisions. However, while positive nutrients, such as Vitamin C, may be present in 
alcohol at times, they should not be included on alcohol labels as this could mislead consumers 
into drinking more alcohol based on a false understanding of its impact on health. This would be 
consistent with TTB’s prohibition of any statement on alcohol that is untrue or that “tends to 
create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption.”30–32 
 
TTB’s proposed rule requires the number of calories, and the grams of carbohydrates, fat, and 
protein, per serving as part of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. While the proposal is an 
improvement over the status quo of voluntary disclosure, additional information on nutrient 
content is necessary for consumers to make informed choices about their health and should be 
made mandatory. 
 
a. Consumers want more nutrition information on alcohol. 
 
Polling data show that consumers want this information and would find it useful when making 
purchasing decisions. In a poll of U.S. adults who drink (described above), respondents said they 
would support policies to require mandatory labeling of calorie content (66%) and nutritional 
content (64%).13 And the majority of respondents said calorie (78%) and nutritional labeling 
(78%) would be at least “somewhat important” when deciding whether to purchase a particular 
alcoholic beverage. Without the Alcohol Facts label, consumers do not have adequate 
information about the content and quality of alcoholic beverages to make informed purchasing 
decisions. 
 
b. In addition to the proposed requirements for calories, carbs, fat, and protein, 
consumers would benefit from consistent access to information on total sugars, 
added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium (discussed in detail below).  
 
i. Total Sugars/Added Sugars 
TTB’s proposed rule includes mandatory disclosure of grams of carbohydrates and provides the 
option for sugar disclosure but leaves out added sugars entirely. Added sugars information is 
important because the DGA recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10% of calories 
(about 50 grams for the 2000-calorie reference diet), whereas there is no limit for total sugars.
26 
In order to follow dietary guidelines, people need to know how much added sugar they are    
 
11 
 
consuming. The average American adult consumes about 72 grams of added sugar per day, about 
40% more than the recommendation.33 Overconsumption of foods and beverages high in added 
sugars is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes34–36 and cardiovascular disease37–39 in part by 
increasing the risk of weight gain,40 and can contribute to dental decay.41 
 
Consumers are interested in sugar information. According to the 2019 FDA Food Safety and 
Nutrition Survey (FSANS), 71% of respondents said they are trying to reduce their sugar intake. 
And when looking at nutrition labels 52% look for total sugars and 34% look for added sugars.42  
 
Meanwhile, many alcoholic beverages are high in sugar. Winemakers are allowed to add 
substantial amounts of sugar after fermentation. As per TTB regulations, added sugar can 
account for up to 21% of a wine’s total weight.43 And while pure distilled liquor is sugar free, 
products containing liquor, such as liqueurs and canned cocktails, can be especially high in 
sugar. For example, a 2.5-ounce serving of the liqueur Kahlua contains 30 grams of sugar44 and a 
12-ounce can of Cutwater Pina Colada contains 32 grams of sugar.45 If these are all added 
sugars, that is over half of the recommended daily limit in a single serving of each. 
 
If the proposed rule is published without amendment, the lack of consistency with labeling of 
FDA-regulated alcoholic products, which includes added sugars, could lead to confusion. For 
example, if a consumer is accustomed to seeing total and added sugars disclosed on hard seltzer 
products and then sees an “Alcohol Facts” panel on a canned cocktail that includes some nutrient 
information but no line for sugar or added sugars, they may assume it means the canned cocktail 
contains no added sugars or even no sugar at all. Without a combination of carbohydrates, total 
sugars, and added sugars labeling, consumers are not equipped with the information they need to 
select products that fit with their dietary and health goals. 
 
ii. Saturated Fat 
The current proposed rule requires disclosure of total fat but does not even mention saturated fat. 
While the proposed rule provides an extensive explanation of how TTB arrived at other similar 
decisions (e.g., whether to include sodium and sugar content in the alcohol facts panel), there is 
no explanation of why TTB chose to include total but not saturated fat. The agency is instead 
soliciting feedback on whether any additional information on fat should be included. 
 
The focus on total fat over type of fat is misaligned with the DGA, which focus on type of fat 
instead of total fat. Indeed, in 2015, the DGA stopped emphasizing total fat and changed the 
focus to limiting saturated fat.
46,47 The Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee reaffirmed advice from previous years to “limit foods and beverages higher in 
saturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent of calories per day 
starting at age 2 by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly [polyunsaturated fatty acids].”48  
 
Consumers are interested in this information and fat and saturated fat are present in some 
alcoholic beverages. In the 2019 FDA FSANS, 43% of respondents reported that they look at 
total fat on the Nutrition Facts label, and 30% look at saturated fat.
42 While many alcoholic 
beverages contain no fat, consumers might be unaware that some contain high amounts of 
saturated fat. For example, Baileys Irish Cream has 7 grams of total fat per 1.7 ounce serving, of 
which 4 grams are saturated fat (20% of the recommended daily value),49,50 making this product    
 
12 
 
“high” in saturated fat by FDA standards. Cutwater Espresso Martini, a canned cocktail, contains 
14 grams of total fat per 12-ounce can but does not disclose how much of that is saturated fat.51 
For both products, this information is only available online with no on-bottle indication that the 
information is available. To improve transparency and allow consumers to make informed 
choices, TTB should mandate that both fat and saturated fat appear on the “Alcohol Facts” label. 
 
iii. Sodium 
The current proposed rule does not include any micronutrients, and for the most part we agree 
with this choice (see below). However, disclosure of sodium content should be mandatory given 
consumer interest and the strong need for sodium reduction at the population level. Dietary 
sodium is an important nutrient to monitor due to the connection between excess sodium intake, 
increased blood pressure, and development of cardiovascular disease.52 The DGA recommend 
that adults adhere to a 2,300 milligrams daily sodium limit26  but, according to data from 2021-
2023 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Americans ages 20 and older consume 
far more, an average of 3,212 milligrams per day.53 Reducing sodium intake by 1,200 milligrams 
per day could prevent an estimated 44,000 to 92,000 deaths from any cause and prevent 32,000–
66,000 strokes, 54,000–99,000 myocardial infarctions, and 60,000–120,000 cases of coronary 
heart disease.54 
 
Consumers are interested in this information and may not know that sodium is present in some 
alcoholic beverages. Data from the 2019 FDA FSANS show that 46% of consumers are 
watching their sodium intake and 49% look at sodium on the Nutrition Facts label.42 While many 
alcoholic beverages have little to no sodium, some canned cocktails contain considerable 
amounts, such as Cutwater Spicy Bloody Mary, which has 390 milligrams of sodium (17% DV) 
per 12-ounce can.55 Also, the Gose style of beer is traditionally salted. SeaQuench, a popular 
Gose beer by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, contains 105 milligrams of sodium (5% DV) in a 12-
ounce serving.56 Consumers who seek to limit their sodium intake rely on labels to monitor the 
sodium content of products and would benefit from sodium labeling on alcoholic beverages. 
 
c. All nutrition information should be mandatory, provided consistently, and 
accompanied by percent Daily Value information. 
 
As mentioned above, a CSPI analysis of top beer and wine brands found that the voluntary 
statement of average analysis was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.14 The option to 
provide nutrition information voluntarily has been available to industry since 2013.4 It will not 
become consistently available to consumers unless it is required. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at specific 
levels. The current proposal requires all nutritional elements to be listed as part of the “Alcohol 
Facts” label, regardless of amount. Some producers might argue that because products in their 
beverage category rarely or never contain fat, they should not have to label fat content. We 
recognize that many consumers may not expect alcoholic beverages to be a source of fat, outside 
certain categories (e.g. cream-based liqueurs). However, understanding when a product contains 
0 grams of a nutrient may be informative for consumers seeking to track their intake. One option 
that could help provide consumers with information while focusing on nutritional elements that 
are most informative would be for TTB to build on an approach already used by the FDA for    
 
13 
 
some nutrients,57 and allow products containing a zero in certain nutrients (e.g., saturated fat, 
added sugars), to omit that nutrient and instead bear a footnote stating, “Not a significant source 
of______.”  
 
TTB should also follow FDA’s lead and require the percentage of the Daily Value (%DV) of the 
listed nutrients (when applicable) as %DV provides context for the amount of each nutrient 
present. 
 
d. Additional harmonization with FDA labels would not be beneficial. 
 
TTB is also soliciting feedback on whether it should harmonize the “Alcohol Facts” label with 
FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” label and whether numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral 
content should be permitted on alcoholic beverages. The suggestions above would help 
harmonize TTB’s alcohol facts label with FDA’s label in part, but the two should not be 
harmonized further. Because alcohol should not be seen as a source of nutrition, it is unnecessary 
to adopt the full nutrient labeling required because, as explained previously, vitamins and 
minerals considered to be positive nutrients could mislead consumers to believe that 
consumption of alcoholic beverages has significant nutritional value or other health-related 
benefits.  
 
The importance of not emphasizing positive nutrients on alcohol given its known health harm 
was recently affirmed when Molson Coors settled a lawsuit for $9.5 million that alleged its 
advertisement of Vizzy hard seltzer as containing “antioxidant vitamin C from acerola 
superfruit” was misleading.
58 The plaintiffs alleged that claim was misleading on the grounds 
that most consumers already consume sufficient Vitamin C, the amount of Vitamin C added does 
not provide a proven health benefit, and alcohol consumption interferes with nutrient absorption.  
Due to the risk for consumer confusion and deceptive marketing of alcoholic beverages as 
healthy, vitamins, minerals (other than sodium), monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and 
fiber should not be included as part of the alcohol facts statement. 
 
7) The proposed tolerance levels for panel element calculation are appropriate. 
 
We agree with the proposed tolerance of +/- 20% for each nutrient content element. These 
tolerances align with what is allowed on the Nutrition Facts statement mandated by FDA.59 The 
ranges specified in the proposed rule are an improvement over the tolerances set forth in TTB 
Procedure 2020-1, which sets an upper but not lower tolerance limit for calories, carbohydrates, 
and fat, stating that products may be “within a reasonable range below the labeled or advertised 
amount” and a lower but not upper limit for protein.60 The +/- 20% tolerance ranges strike a 
balance of being generous enough to allow for the option to use databases for standard products 
while still providing consumers information accurate enough to make informed choices about 
their health. The tolerance limits should not be increased as this would diminish their usefulness 
to consumers. 
 
     
 
14 
 
8) All products with 0.5% ABV or more should clearly list %ABV. 
 
a. Beers Not Defined as “Malt Beverages"" and Non-Alcoholic (NA) Beers 
 
We agree with TTB’s decision to mandate an alcohol content statement on the labels of beers not 
defined as “malt beverages.” These products, which are under FDA labeling jurisdiction, are 
required to bear the “Nutrition Facts” panel, but consumers often miss out on vital alcohol 
content information because %ABV is not mandatory. This information is both important for 
public health and, as explained in the rule, would facilitate revenue protection by making it clear 
that the products are subject to tax.1 
 
We also agree with TTB’s decision to require an “Alcohol Facts” statement for non-alcoholic 
malt beverages under TTB control, but to not require a specific statement of the percentage of 
alcohol by volume. An “Alcohol Facts” statement is needed to inform consumers of their calorie 
and nutritional content, but since “non-alcoholic” is clearly defined for malt beverages, these 
products can be exempt from the requirement to disclose %ABV and fluid ounces of pure 
ethanol, as long as the proper terminology appears on-package. The phrase “contains less than 
0.5 percent (or .5%) alcohol by volume” is currently required to appear directly adjacent to the 
term “non-alcoholic.”
61 
b. Wine 
 
We agree with TTB’s proposal to require %ABV labeling on all wine. Percent ABV is currently 
only required on wines with less than 7% ABV or greater than 14% ABV (wines of 7-14% ABV 
can omit this information if labeled “table wine”),62 but wine should not be exempt from 
providing accurate, specific mandatory statements of %ABV on label. Consumers can only make 
informed decisions about how much to drink if they have access to information on alcohol 
strength. 
 
Labeling with only a %ABV range would leave consumers with incomplete information about 
the strength of wine. As mentioned above, this is basic information that consumers look for and 
mandating this information is robustly supported by consumers and important to their purchasing 
decisions. A %ABV range is not specific enough to fully inform consumers as there is double the 
amount of alcohol in a same-sized serving of a 14% ABV wine compared to a 7% ABV wine. 
With only a %ABV range, consumers may accidentally consume more alcohol than intended, 
which increases the risk of alcohol-related injuries and death. 
 
9) Clear formatting requirements are needed to ensure consumers can consistently find 
nutrition and alcohol content information. 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on format and display of the “Alcohol Facts” panel including requests 
for comment on general formatting, linear display, and whether the option to provide “Alcohol 
Facts” solely via QR code should be allowed. 
 
 
1 Note: for beers not defined as “malt beverages” that are regulated by the FDA, TTB plans to use its authority 
under the Internal Revenue Code to require “Alcohol Facts” information on these products    
 
15 
 
a. General Formatting Recommendations 
 
The proposed rule requires that the panel or linear display be offset within a box by use of 
hairlines with all black (or one color) type on a contrasting background in an easy-to-read type 
style that uses both upper- and lower-case letters. Minimum type size is 1 millimeter for smaller 
containers and 2 millimeters for larger containers. The terms “Alcohol Facts” and “Amount per 
serving” must appear in bold. 
 
Overall we agree with these requirements, and request additional requirements for a larger type 
size for calories, minimum spacing and kerning, and a standardized font, all of which are 
required by FDA on the Nutrition Facts panel (see Figure 5 for example of FDA-regulated 
alcohol).
63 However, linear formatting should only be allowed on very small containers. We also 
urge TTB to adopt greater specificity with regard to providing contrasting color, as this term is 
subject to potentially wide interpretation, and suggest that the TTB use language adopted by 
FDA in regulations for Nutrition Facts, which require that the disclosure “shall be all black or 
one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical.”
64 
TTB should additionally specify, at minimum, that “contrasting background” does not include 
two different shades of the same color (as is popular on some beer cans currently and difficult to 
read) (see Figure 6). 
 
b. Display Orientation and Format 
 
The proposed rule allows for horizontal or vertical “Alcohol Facts”. Requiring that this 
information appear in a horizontal format would increase the chances that consumers notice and 
utilize it, as a vertical format requires the consumer to take the additional step of turning the 
bottle sideways to access the information (see Figure 4). TTB should only allow vertical 
presentation of “Alcohol Facts” on smaller packages. A literature review prepared for Food 
Standards Australia New Zealand included “text to be printed horizontally rather than vertically” 
in a summary of factors that gain attention on food labels.65 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on whether consumers would have trouble locating an “Alcohol 
Facts” panel using a linear display. The current proposal allows for “Alcohol Facts” information 
to be displayed in either panel (as shown in Figure 5) or linear format (as shown in Figure 6), 
but linear formatting should only be allowed on smaller containers.  
 
The panel format would make the “Alcohol Facts” information easier for consumers to locate 
and read compared to a linear display. TTB notes that they are providing this option to prevent 
businesses from having to purchase new equipment to add an additional label. A CSPI analysis 
of the labels of products from the top wine and beer brands (described above) found that, of 
wines and beers that contained serving information, only 5% used a block (also known as panel) 
format whereas 95% used the continuous (also known as linear) format.
14 This suggests a strong 
industry preference for this format and a likelihood that this will continue to be used heavily. 
Because the linear format is difficult for consumers to find and read, TTB should mandate panel 
format on most packages to avoid this outcome.  
    
 
16 
 
Currently, FDA only allows the option for linear presentation of the mandatory Nutrition Facts 
panel for products in very small packages, which does not include standard-size products, as 
such packages are large enough to carry nutrition facts and ingredients.66 If linear display is 
allowed, it should be reserved as an option for containers below a certain size and required to 
appear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type to aid consumers in locating it.

c. Maximum Type Size for %ABV on Malt Beverage 
 
TTB should remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol 
content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an “Alcohol Facts” statement but specify 
instead that the %ABV must be the same size as the other text in the “Alcohol Facts” statement 
(no larger, no smaller). For malt beverages, there is no need for TTB to remove the maximum 
type size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label, as this 
information would be easy to find alongside other important per-serving information in the 
“Alcohol Facts” panel.  
 
d. Electronic Display Should Not be Allowed 
 
We support TTB’s proposed approach of requiring the alcohol content and nutrition information 
to be listed on the physical beverage container. There should not be an option to provide this 
solely via QR code. Electronic disclosure places a barrier between consumers and this vital 
health and safety information.  
 
Consumers prefer to receive this information directly on the product packaging. In the March 
2024 poll mentioned above, adults who drink alcohol were asked: “How would you prefer to 
learn about the ingredients, alcohol content, allergens, calories, and nutritional content of an 
alcoholic beverage?” Respondents could select one of four response options: 
• Read this information on the label of the container 
• Scan a QR code on the label 
• Visit a website address provided on the label 
• I do not want to learn this information 
 
More than three quarters (76%) of respondents said they would prefer to read information on the 
label of the container, while only 11% preferred to scan a QR code. The desire to see this 
information on-package was particularly strong among respondents living in suburban (79%) and 
rural communities (78%) compared to those living in urban communities (70%) and respondents 
over the age of 65 (83%) compared to younger respondents (71% of respondents ages 21-34) 
(Appendix A). 
 
Barriers created by QR code disclosures would disproportionately affect consumers who are 
older or have lower incomes. Accessing a QR code requires a smartphone, which not all 
consumers have, and Internet access coupled with good reception, which not all stores and 
drinking venues provide. In 2024, 84% of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned 
smartphones compared to 96% of adults with an annual household incomes over $100,000.
67 
These data show similar sized gaps in smartphone ownership by age, with 79% of adults aged 65 
and older owning smartphones compared to 91 to 98% of adults in younger age groups.  
 
Those living in rural or tribal areas would also be disproportionately impacted by lack of access 
to information if provided via QR code. A recent Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) 
report,
68 which included data from 2022, shows a rural-urban gap for access to high-speed 
mobile internet (defined as 5G-New Radio (5G-NR) with upload/download speeds at least 35/3    
 
18 
 
megabits per second (Mbps)) with 64% access in rural areas versus 98% in urban areas. People 
living in tribal areas also face lower rates of access to reliable mobile internet (78%) compared to 
those living in urban areas. Even rates of “fixed terrestrial services” (i.e., fixed broadband 
services excluding fixed satellite service) deployments at all internet speeds differ for rural 
versus urban versus tribal areas, with especially large gaps in access to internet speeds of 100/20 
Mbps (which FCC uses as a benchmark to assess progress towards the goal of ensuring all 
Americans have access to “advanced telecommunications capability.”) While 98% of Americans 
living in urban areas have access to fixed terrestrial service speeds of 100/20 Mbps, only 72% of 
those living in rural areas and 76% of those living in tribal areas have access to this internet 
service speed. 
 
Moreover, loading information through a QR code takes time, further deterring use and 
prolonging purchasing decisions. A loading time of even a few seconds could prolong shopping 
time if comparing many products, making it less likely the information will be utilized. 
 
Alcohol industry members will complain about the lack of label space and argue that it will cost 
extra to place this information on-package, but they are already providing a full nutrition facts 
panel on-package for all alcoholic beverages that fall under FDA’s jurisdiction (see Figure 5). 
And non-mandatory label information, such as marketing, could be presented via QR code if 
industry members are concerned about label space. 
 
10) The compliance period should be shortened to 3.5 years and harmonized with the 
allergens labeling rule to minimize cost. 
 
Throughout the proposed rule, TTB is soliciting feedback on the cost that these changes might 
have for industry. Producers will incur some costs when implementing updated labeling 
requirements and may opt to pass these costs along to consumers. But alcohol manufacturers, 
including small producers, with products under FDA’s jurisdiction have been successfully 
providing similar labels for years and remain economically viable. For example, most hard cider 
producers must comply with FDA labeling rules, and local and regional hard cider sales 
increased by 6% from 2022 to 2023,
69 demonstrating that small alcoholic beverage businesses 
can thrive while adhering to comprehensive labeling requirements. Additionally, some beverages 
are providing some of this information already on a voluntary basis. As mentioned above, an 
analysis of labels from top wine and beer brands that 63% of beers chose to include the statement 
of average analysis—proof that this is feasible. 
 
It is also worth noting that higher prices for alcoholic beverages, assuming that manufacturers 
pass at least some of any added costs on to consumers, would not be a bad thing from a public 
health perspective. Policies that increase the price of alcohol decrease alcohol consumption.
70 
Alcohol prices and taxes are inversely associated with alcohol-related morbidity and mortality 
including violence, traffic crash fatalities, and drunk driving.71 An increase in the price of 
alcoholic beverages could help those who drink to better adhere to moderate drinking guidelines 
and lead to a reduction in alcohol-related morbidity and related costs.  
 
     
 
19 
 
Still, it is understandable that TTB is conscious of the price of these changes and the costs of 
relabeling are such that the impact upon price will be limited. Costs can be minimized by 
selecting a fair compliance deadline and coordinating the compliance deadline with the allergen 
labeling rule. 
 
a. Selecting a Fair Compliance Date 
 
The proposed compliance period of 5 years is too long. According to FDA, food and beverage 
products tend to be voluntarily relabeled on a 2-5 year cycle, with most products undergoing 
voluntary label changes at least every 2-3 years.
72 Generally, the cost of label changes includes 
new labeling equipment (if needed) and any costs associated with label redesign, printing, and 
administrative costs. While extra staff time for mandatory label specific changes may add slight 
cost, when label changes for regulatory purposes coincide with changes the manufacturer would 
have made to their label in any case, the analysis estimates that there is minimal additional cost 
for the label design change to the manufacturer if no new labeling equipment is needed. 
 
TTB’s own economic estimates demonstrate that the extended 5-year cycle is unnecessary as it 
provides little to no cost savings relative to a 3.5-year compliance period. The agency model 
assumes that for brand name products, 100% of changes would overlap with a regularly 
scheduled change within 2 years and that private labels, which make up a smaller share of the 
market, would be able to coordinate 100% of their changes by the 3.5-year mark. The model 
estimates that there are per-UPC cost reductions in extending the compliance period from 2 years 
to 3.5 years, but from 3.5 years onward the cost per UPC does not decrease further. Similarly, the 
total cost would not decrease further by extending the compliance period out past 3.5 years. 
 
Another metric used in TTB’s analysis, the total cost using a 2% discount rate, similarly sees a 
dramatic decrease in the total cost when extending the deadline from 2 years to 3.5 years ($323.4 
million at 2 years down to $259.5 million at 3 years and down to $204.3 million 3.5 years). 
However, the reduction in price is far smaller when extending from a 3.5- to a 5-year compliance 
period, which reduces the discounted total by only ~$3 million more (1.5%). Based on TTB’s 
own analysis, a 3.5-year compliance period would be more than fair and strike a balance between 
minimizing cost to industry and getting consumers access to important and long overdue 
information in a timely fashion. 
 
b. Coordinating Compliance Date Among Other TTB Rulings 
 
To further minimize costs, we recommend that TTB align the compliance dates for the two 
current proposed rules. We also urge TTB to release the third rule on ingredients labeling, which 
was previously sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
73 This is a pre-rule and 
as such would likely take much longer than the other two rules to finalize. Because full 
coordination of all three rules would likely lead to significant delay of the first two rules, we 
recommend that compliance dates on only the first two rules be coordinated. 
 
     
 
20 
 
11) Conclusion 
 
Increased transparency for alcohol labeling is desired by consumers and long overdue. We hope 
that TTB will move swiftly to finalize this proposed rule with the adjustments described above 
so that consumers can have access to the nutrition and alcohol content information that they want 
and need to make informed decisions about their health.

Re: TTB Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverage 
 
Dear Director Greenberg, 
 
I write on behalf of the Brewers Association (BA) to provide written input on TTB 
Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverage.1  We appreciate the extension of the comment period for this 
notice and respectfully submit these written comments on behalf of America’s 
small and independent brewers.  We thank you in advance for your time and 
attention to these comments. 
 
As you know, The Brewers Association is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association 
of brewers, for brewers and by brewers.  We have approximately 5,000 U.S. 
professional brewery members and over 1,200 supplier members from throughout 
the beer supply chain.  Our mission is to promote and protect American 
craft brewers and their beers. 
 
The Brewers Association has long championed transparency in the labeling and 
advertising of malt beverages (those subject to the Federal Alcohol Administration 
Act2 – FAA Act) and all beer.  We have called for mandatory alcohol content labeling 
and disclosure of major allergens3 for many years.  But America’s small and 
independent brewers also face unprecedented headwinds today.  A crowded 
marketplace, consumption declines, rising supply and labor costs, financially 
challenged consumers, and other difficulties have seen the market for our 
members’ beer (and, indeed, all beer) contract and brewery closings outpace 
openings last year for the first time in decades.

Given these headwinds, we urge TTB to pay special attention to small businesses’ 
needs in proceeding with any new labeling mandate.  TTB and its predecessor have 
considered mandatory nutrient and nutritional labeling regulations since the 1970s, 
belying any argument that new regulations are urgently needed.  Moreover, while 
Notice 237 embraces some ideas – notably more generous tolerances and a five-
year phase-in period – that would mitigate a final rule’s impact on small business, 
substantial burdens remain.  Those burdens will fall with particular force on small 
batch products of small producers, tilting the playing field even more in favor of 
large multinational brewers.  We urge TTB to consider carefully the impact of its 
actions on small American manufacturers as it moves forward. 
 
1. History Justiﬁes a Healthy Skepticism About this Rule 
 
Any keen observer of the federal regulation of labeling and marketing of malt 
beverages, wine, and distilled spirits must surely get a sense of “déjà vu all over 
again”4 when reviewing the nutritional disclosure mandates proposed in Notice 237.  
In addition, taking a broader societal look at the record of such nutritional 
disclosure mandates, it is hard not to question their effectiveness in achieving their 
objectives. 
 
TTB’s predecessor, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), first 
proposed nutrient labeling rules, in the form of mandatory ingredient labeling, in the 
1970s.  ATF proposed ingredient labeling and then withdrew the proposal in 1975, 
concluding that the costs of the proposal outweighed any benefit to consumers.5  
The federal Food & Drug Administration (FDA) promptly stepped in, proposing 
ingredient labeling for alcohol beverage labels imposed under its existing federal 
Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authority.6  A legal challenge to FDA’s action 
helped persuade FDA to abandon that effort, deferring to ATF on products subject 
to the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FAA Act.7 
 
With FDA deferring to ATF, ATF itself commencing rulemaking to impose an 
ingredient (nutrient) labeling regime of its own on FAA Act-regulated products, with 
regulations published in 1980.8  The incoming Administration of President Ronald 
Reagan sought to withdraw these regulations, eventually succeeding after a series 
of court decisions to resolve a legal challenge to ATF’s decision to withdraw the 
rule.9  The saga, of course, was not over, and the next round of proposals, this time 
with mandatory nutritional information in addition to nutrient/ingredient 
disclosures, emerged in the early 2000s.  Notice 237 acknowledges and catalogues 
those and subsequent nutritional labeling efforts by TTB.10

While the ATF and TTB concluded, multiple times, to focus limited resources 
elsewhere in the past fifty years, other parts of the federal government pursued an 
agenda of mandatory nutritional labeling on multiple fronts.  Efforts to impose 
nutritional labeling on food kicked off in 1969 with the White House Conference on 
Food, Nutrition, and Health recommending FDA regulations.11  By 1973, that 
recommendation had yielded final FDA regulations that were mandatory for foods 
making any nutrition claims or when nutrients were added to the food.  By the late 
1980s, a chorus of advocacy called for universal nutritional labeling on food, and 
amidst multiple FDA proposals, Congress responded by passing the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act (NLEA).12  The NLEA gave FDA explicit authority to 
require nutritional labeling on most food packages and resulted in final FDA 
regulations that were published in 1993. 
 
Following the imposition of near-universal nutritional labeling for packaged foods, 
food service at restaurants represented the next frontier.  The Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)13 required chain restaurants (those that are 
part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and 
offering for sale substantially the same menu items) to disclose calorie and other 
nutrition information to consumers at the point of sale.  FDA regulations 
implementing the ACA’s mandate went into effect in 2018,14 although multiple cities 
and states already had mandated calorie and nutritional disclosures for restaurants 
earlier. 
 
All told, since 1970 the subject of nutrient and nutritional disclosures for foods has 
taken up thousands of pages of the Federal Register, along with numerous rulings, 
interpretive guidance documents, and official government websites.  The primary 
purpose of all these mandates has been to induce Americans to eat healthier, with 
a particular emphasis on controlling excessive calorie intake.  One would think, 
then, that fifty-plus years of federal government action would have produced a track 
record of success, with Americas eating healthier than ever before. 
 
Of course, history tells a very different story.  Obesity rates have soared, with each 
new round of mandatory nutritional labeling having no discernable impact on the 
crises.

In sharp contrast, per-capita alcohol consumption has remained remarkably steady 
since 1970, largely tracking demographic and economic patters.16  Indeed, in the 
past three years alcohol beverage consumption has fallen to historic lows.17  In 
short, decades of real-world experience provide zero evidence that nutritional 
labeling leads to healthier eating choices, nor that the absence of such labeling on 
alcohol beverages increases unhealthy consumption. 
 
Finally, we cannot help but note the irony that the current effort to impose 
nutritional labeling on alcohol arose from 2022’s Treasury Report on Competition.18  
The Treasury Report found that ‘‘[r]egulatory proposals that could serve public 
health and foster competition by providing information to consumers, such as 
mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been 
implemented” and urged the TTB to take action to revive rulemaking on nutrition 
labelling, among several subjects.19  But even a casual review of Notice 237 would 
conclude that it is about consumer information and education, not competition.  
Indeed, by mandating a uniform set of disclosures by nearly all alcohol beverage 
producers, any final rule will have the effect (like all regulations) of removing an

aspect of competition (competing for consumers by providing more nutritional 
information) and replacing it with a government mandate.  A government mandate 
replacing competition is the antithesis of fostering competition.  Moreover, as 
explained further below, by imposing disproportionate burdens on small producers 
versus large, new nutritional disclosure mandates could further tilt the playing field 
towards large market share companies and against market entrants and upstart 
competitors. 
 
2. A Final Rule will Burden Small Producers 
 
The Brewers Association appreciates TTB’s efforts to mitigate the impact of the 
proposed nutritional mandate on small businesses.  While Notice 237’s broader 
tolerances for calculating alcohol content and nutritional measures and its five-
year implementation period certainly help, we wish to emphasize that a final rule 
will impose substantial burdens on many small and independent brewers, as well 
as small wineries, distilleries, and cider makers. 
 
More generous tolerances will often allow a brewer to promulgate compliant 
nutritional measures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) using typical values 
charts, but only for “standard products”20 (e.g., a beer made from only malted 
barley, hops, water, and yeast).  Similarly, the +/- 1% alcohol by volume (ABV) 
tolerance proposed in Notice 237 will allow brewers to calculate alcohol content 
without outside testing or sophisticated equipment.  But in today’s innovative 
brewing industry, a great many products use other ingredients in brewing, such as 
exotic grains, fruits, nuts, herbs and spices, flavorings, and a myriad of other food 
products.  For example, this spring the Brewers Association solicited comments 
from its members on topics related to Notice 237, including whether they produce 
products made with non-standard ingredients.  Of the 83 respondents, 77 (over 
90%) indicated that they make some beers using special ingredients.  We believe 
that the respondents provide a representative sample of today’s craft brewers. 
 
TTB’s Public COLAs Registry confirms that non-standard malt beverages make up a 
substantial part of today’s total malt beverage market.  A search of the Registry 
earlier this month21 identified a total of 29,752 malt beverage label approvals in the 
past year.  Of those, 9,159 were class/type 906, malt beverage specialties – flavored 
malt beverages.  In other words, over thirty percent of new malt beverage labels 
likely contain flavorings or other ingredients that could render the use of typical 
values tables non-compliant.  For such products in interstate commerce, expensive 
testing – either by an outside lab or by purchasing new equipment – would be 
required to ensure compliance. 
 
In addition, although many Brewers Association members change labels at least 
once every five years, many do not.  The responses to the Brewers Association 
survey contain many too general to clearly denote whether product labels change 
more- or less than every five years.  But roughly one-third of the respondents appear 
 
20 A point TTB appears to recognize.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667.

to change labels less often (some indicating they never update labels on existing 
products unless required to do so), and another one-third provided ambiguous 
answers suggestive of long waits before label re-design.  While the five-year cycle 
likely holds true for the large brewers and most other large suppliers, it does not 
appear to reflect the entirety or even a substantial majority of the craft beer market. 
 
Notice 237, as written, will particularly impact practices of craft brewers to vary 
recipes of a particular brand.  This practice occurs most frequently in the case of 
seasonal products, with an annual release (for example, a holiday ale) delighting 
consumers with variations in the recipe, keeping the brewery’s customers 
interested in trying the beer year after year.  Brewers employing this practice will 
need to either print new labels each year, something many do not do today, or stop 
varying the recipe each year.  In short, Notice 237 could force many brewers to 
choose between increased costs (to print new labels every year) or reduced 
innovation (by keeping recipes consistent year-over-year). 
 
In sum, while Notice 237 takes some steps to mitigate its impact on small 
producers, it will still have a negative impact on our members, with the biggest 
burden falling on the smallest packaging brewers with the least ability to absorb 
additional costs.  The result will be a combination of greater costs, reduced 
innovation, and simple non-compliance. 
 
3. The Brewers Association Continues to Believe that DiƯerentiating 
Between Large and Small Batch Products is Appropriate and Within TTB’s 
Authority 
 
There is no question that a nutrition labeling rule will impose burdens on small 
producers and the viability of small-batch products.  Although the more realistic 
tolerances proposed in Notice 237 partially blunt these burdens, flavored and other 
specialty malt beverages will continue to face a difficult choice under final rules if 
adopted as proposed:  (a) invest in expensive equipment to test such products; (b) 
send such products to an outside laboratory at considerable expense; or (c) 
discontinue such products in interstate commerce to avoid the added expense.  In 
light of this, the Brewers Association renews its call for TTB to adopt a different 
standard for small producers or low-volume products – which would include most 
products from small producers – to mitigate a nutrition labeling rule’s impact on 
small businesses and on product innovation. 
 
TTB’s reasoning22 for rejecting differentiation between small-batch products and 
others does not withstand closer scrutiny.  As a threshold observation, TTB’s 
regulations are full of differential treatment for brewers based on size.23  In its 
explanation for rejecting this approach, TTB notes – but tellingly without claiming a 
lack of statutory authorization – that the statutory text of the FAA Act does not 
explicitly authorize different treatment between large and small entities or between 
large and small batch size products.  But that text also does not reference 
 
22 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6687. 
23 See 27 C.F .R. §§ 25.91, 25.93, 25.164-25.165, & 25.297. 7 
 
nutritional labeling and a host of other subjects now addressed in existing TTB 
regulations.  Notice 237 itself invokes the Agency’s “broad authority” to regulate 
alcohol.24  Notwithstanding the lack of an explicit statement in the statutory text, we 
believe it is well within the TTB’s discretion to create different rules based on 
producer size, product volume, and batch size. 
 
Notice 237 additionally asserts that an exemption or differential treatment would 
undermine the “primary” purpose of the rule, which is providing more information 
to consumers.25  Before addressing the substance of this position, we note that this 
assertion undermines both the original impetus for initiating this rulemaking 
(premised on competition as announced in the Treasury Report on Competition), 
and TTB’s claimed basis for imposing alcohol content labeling on non-FAA Act 
products (premised on protection and collection of excise tax revenue).  
 
There is no reason a final rule cannot balance consumer information with the need 
to protect competition and the interests of small businesses.  We acknowledge, of 
course, that exempting or loosening standards for some small subset of the market 
would marginally limit the information available to consumers.  But TTB and other 
food labeling authorities already do this in a myriad of ways: 
 
 The nutritional labeling requirements (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and 
proteins) only apply to products moving in interstate commerce, thereby 
already exempting many products that do not cross state lines.   
 
 Several categories of alcohol beverages, notably including fermented hard 
seltzers, most hard ciders, and other low-alcohol wines, would not fall under 
Notice 237’s nutritional label rules.  While some of these (depending on 
production quantity and business size – see below) would fall under FDA’s 
nutritional labeling requirements, those requirements are diƯerent in 
multiple respects from the requirements proposed in Notice 237. 
 
 The primary regulator imposing nutritional and other food label disclosures, 
the FDA, exempts products produced in quantities under 100,000 units in a 
year from its nutritional labeling requirements.26 
 
 The FDA also exempts from those regulations retailers who have no more 
than $500,000 in direct sales to consumers or no more than $50,000 in sales 
of food or dietary supplements to consumers.27 
 
 The FDA’s requirement for menu labeling disclosures only applies to 
restaurants and similar retail establishments that are a part of a chain with

In short, a sensible exemptions or adjustments for small batch products or small 
businesses would hardly be unprecedented and, in our view, would strike the 
appropriate balance between informing the consumer and promoting rigorous 
competition and consumer choice. 
 
A different requirement for small-batch products would be no harder to administer 
than a host of other TTB rules that rely on industry member representations to make 
determinations during the Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) review process.  On 
issues as varied as class/type designation, alcohol content, interstate jurisdiction, 
and method of manufacture, TTB relies on the industry members providing it with 
truthful information to review and approve COLAs.  TTB then polices the market to 
ensure that the industry member did not, for example, fill a container labeled with 
one TTB beverage type with liquid that constitutes another type.  TTB could easily 
add a field to its COLA application form29 to identify whether or not a product 
qualifies for different treatment under a small-batch or small business threshold.  
Should an industry member rely on such a COLA for products that have exceeded 
the threshold, TTB would retain its considerable enforcement authority to police the 
market and punish non-compliance.  As a reminder to the industry member, TTB 
can also “qualify” a label approval for a small-batch product, just as it does for 
Certificates of Exemption from Label Approval and in other appropriate 
circumstances. 
 
4. If Regulations are Adopted, TTB Should Use the Term “Serving Facts” 
instead of “Alcohol Facts”30 
 
Notice 237 adopts the term “alcohol facts” as a shorthand for the specific 
nutritional and other disclosures it would mandate, and the term would accompany 
the disclosures on actual labels.  The Brewers Association opposes this departure 
from TTB’s current term for voluntary nutritional labels, “serving facts,” and urges 
TTB to revert to that term should it move forward with Notice 237. 
 
For over a decade consumers have seen the term “serving facts” on FAA Act-
regulated alcohol beverages bearing voluntary nutritional information.31  
Consumers, particularly those with an interest in such information, now recognize 
and understand the label and rely on it.  Moreover, we are not aware of any 
problems or confusion arising from use of the term “serving facts.”  As such, the 
reasoning behind the proposed change is not readily apparent. 
 
The term “alcohol facts” seems, at best, incongruous, and at worst, misdescriptive.  
Most of the nutritional information proposed for disclosure in Notice 237 are, in 
fact, facts about various nutritional measures (not alcohol) per serving – in other 
words, serving facts.  Surely consumers think of information on calories, 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein as serving facts, regardless of whether that

30 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.1., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6664-65. 
31 See TTB Ruling 2013–2 (May 28, 2013). 9 
 
information relates to a product containing alcohol or not.  In contrast, the term 
“alcohol facts” implies facts about alcohol consumption, which the information 
proposed for disclosure in Notice 237 does not contain. 
 
The Brewers Association disagrees with the suggestion, apparently made by certain 
commenters and accepted by TTB, that “serving facts” would confuse consumers 
about the alcoholic nature of products.  As noted above, the Brewers Association is 
not aware of any problems with the voluntary use of “serving facts” under current 
TTB policy and rulings.  Moreover, there are many label indicia under existing 
regulations governing FAA Act-regulated products signaling that a product contains 
alcohol, including: 
 
 The mandatory government warning statement. 
 
 The class and/or type designation. 
 
 The alcohol content statement on most products, which Notice 237 would 
extend to all products, including all malt beverages and wines. 
 
Moreover, consumers respond to common-sense information such as the brand 
name of the product, as brand conveys important clues to consumers about the 
nature of the products they buy (i.e., consumers associate “Sierra Nevada” with 
malt beverages and “Pepsi” with soft drinks).  The notion that a consumer will 
ignore all such information and instead focus myopically on the words “serving 
facts” to infer a product contains no alcohol makes no sense. 
 
Finally, Notice 237 ignores the reality that another subset of alcohol beverages 
already use a different term than “alcohol facts” without any apparent problem.  
Products labeled under the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FDA must use the 
term “nutrition facts.”32  Such products include fermented hard seltzers, most hard 
ciders, and other low-alcohol wine products.  Yet to our knowledge, use of the 
words “nutrition facts” has not misled consumers about the alcoholic nature of 
these beverages. 
 
If mandatory nutritional labeling rules are finalized, they should use the term 
“serving facts” and not “alcohol facts.” 
 
5. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports the 
Decision to Keep Disclosures Consistent with the Current Statement of 
Average Analysis33 
 
The Brewers Association supports Notice 237’s approach to limit nutritional 
disclosures to those familiar to consumers of light beer and other existing products 
– calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  These four measures have graced the 
labels of many malt beverages since 1980, when TTB’s predecessor ATF first 
 
32 See 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. 
33 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.2., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6666-67. 10 
 
mandated the use of a statement of average analysis on “light”/“lite” beer labels.34  
We see no reason to depart from that successful policy. 
 
The Brewers Association does not support a rule that would mandate more 
extensive nutritional disclosures, like those mandated under the FD&C Act.35  
Should TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the information required 
under Notice 237’s proposed rule already will depart from FDA-mandated 
information due to the inclusion of alcohol content information.  Moreover, labels of 
FAA Act regulated products will depart from FDA-regulated products in multiple 
other ways, including the inclusion of the mandatory Government Warning 
Statement, a different standard of identity system, and the lack of ingredient 
labeling information.  While FDA regulations and policy can provide useful guidance 
in appropriate circumstances, we do not believe that a lock-step adoption of FD&C 
Act nutritional information is appropriate. 
 
In implementing nutritional labeling disclosures, the Brewers Association 
recommends a common-sense refinement where multiple measures would round 
to zero.  In such cases, industry members should have the option of truncating the 
disclosure of multiple measures as “0.”  This would amend currently proposed 
regulations, if finalized, to instead provide the option of stating “0 [the measures 
that would display as zero].”  For example, many malt beverages contain zero fat 
and zero protein.  In such a case, the label could state “0 fat and protein.”  This 
option would provide flexibility and might save a little label space for other 
purposes. 
 
A question in Notice 237 about the nutritional disclosures specifically calls out 
whether a final rule would have competitive effects.  As explained in Section 1 
above, the connection between mandatory nutritional disclosures and traditional 
notions of competition are not clear and, indeed, replacing competition with a 
uniform government mandate is not typically viewed as a pro-competitive policy.  
But the differential burden that the regulations proposed in Notice 237 will place on 
large versus small businesses will further tilt the playing field towards big producers 
and high-volume brands.  The rule as proposed would apply equally to small-batch 
products and would require expensive testing (whether by an outside lab or in-
house using costly equipment) for some, “non-standard,” products.  As such, there 
can be no doubt that Notice 237 as written favors high-volume products that can 
spread the cost of compliance across larger revenues from a particular brand. 
 
Another question asks whether a final rule would burden small producers.  As 
explained in Sections 2 and 3 above, mandatory nutritional labeling rules will, even 
as promulgated with broad tolerances and a five-year implementation date, place a 
burden on small businesses.  We urge TTB to revisit the question of an exemption or 
different rules for small-batch products or small businesses to alleviate this 
burden.

35 See generally 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. 11 
 
 
 
 
6. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports TTB’s 
Objective Standard Approach, but Burdens Remain36 
 
The Brewers Association has long advocated for objective and realistic labeling 
tolerances for small producers.  Subjective tolerances leave industry members 
guessing about their compliance obligations.  And tight tolerances inherently favor 
large producers, who can afford the machinery for tighter production runs and 
possess the equipment necessary to test and adjust batches (e.g., by adjusting 
water addition, as is commonplace in high-gravity brewing) to meet labeled values.   
 
For the reasons above, the Brewers Association applauds the +/- 20% tolerance 
proposed in Notice 237 for calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  The tolerance 
is easily understood and does not leave brewers guessing about whether they are in 
or out of compliance.  And, as already noted, a 20% tolerance is broad enough to 
allow many (but not all) malt beverages to provide compliant label disclosures 
using “typical value” charts that do not require sophisticated equipment or outside 
testing.  
 
The Brewers Association also applauds the broader tolerance of +/- 1% ABV for 
labeled alcohol content on malt beverage and beer labels.  For most malt beverage 
and beer products, a 1% ABV tolerance allows for compliant disclosures using 
simple measurements, such as hydrometer measurements, and straightforward 
calculations.  Departure from the existing 0.3% standard is overdue. 
 
We wish to emphasize, however, that even the expanded and objective tolerances 
will not allow reliable measures for the growing number of innovative brewery 
products made with unusual ingredients or employing unusual processes.  Adding 
fruit, fruit puree, or fruit juice to a malt beverage has become commonplace in the 
past decade and a half.  The addition of such materials, and many others (e.g., 
chocolate), make reliance on a “typical value” chart unreliable.  Indeed, as Notice 
237 itself notes, the proposed tolerances allow calculations or average value tables 
to work only for “standard products.”37  A great many malt beverages – roughly 30% 
based on the last year of COLA approvals – cannot reliability use typical values or 
simple calculations to comply with the nutritional disclosure requirements of 
Notice 237. 
 
7. The Brewers Association Supports Mandatory Alcohol Content Labeling 
for Beer and Malt Beverages, Within a +/- 1% ABV Tolerance38 
 
The Brewers Association has long supported alcohol content labeling for malt 
beverages, provided adequate tolerances are permitted.  Assuming a +/- 1% ABV 
 
36 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.3., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. 
37 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. 
38 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.4. & 5., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6669. 12 
 
tolerance, as proposed by Notice 237, we accordingly support the proposed 
mandatory alcohol content labeling rule for malt beverages and non-FAA Act beer.39 
 
Alcohol content information helps consumers understand the alcoholic strength of 
a beverage so that they can better regulate their intake.  Alcohol content 
information is also well-understood by consumers, as it has been mandated on all 
distilled spirits and most wines for nearly a century.  Thus, unlike untested 
proposals for “standard drink” and similar labeling, alcohol content is a concept 
that consumers know and understand.  Helping consumer regulate their alcohol 
intake using information on alcohol-by-volume will require no education and faces 
no “learning curve.” 
 
Although we support mandatory alcohol content labeling, we also wish to underline 
that adopting the rule will not be cost-free for small brewers for the reasons 
explained in Sections 2 and 3 above. 
 
Notice 237 asks whether a +/- 1% ABV tolerance is potentially misleading 
consumers.  We do not think so.  From a consumption standpoint, 1% ABV is simply 
not enough alcohol to make a material difference in the intoxication of a person 
consuming anything but absurd volumes of a malt beverage or beer.  For a beer 
drinker to consume the equivalent in alcohol of one extra average-strength beer 
(5.0% ABV), that drinker would have to consume five beers, all containing more 
alcohol up to the maximum tolerance allowed, in a compressed amount of time.  
Such a consumer would already be intoxicated by any reasonable measure, 
regardless of the 1% ABV variance. 
 
In addition, multiple policies of TTB already permit added small amounts of alcohol 
without a precise label disclosure, and those policies have not caused issues with 
the public’s ability to control their consumption.  Malt beverages labeled “non-
alcoholic” may contain almost .5% ABV.  And many non-alcohol products (e.g., soft 
drinks) contain small amounts of alcohol, provided they remain under .5% ABV.  In 
both examples, existing policy does not seek to disclose or regulate such de 
minimis amounts.  We see nothing misleading about a 1% ABV tolerance.  Sadly, it 
is not surprising that advocates for the largest multinational brewers seek a tighter 
tolerance, as a tight tolerance imposes costs on small brewers and accordingly 
provides large companies with a competitive advantage. 
 
On the subject of alcohol statements, the Brewers Association was disappointed 
that Notice 237 does not contain any proposal to overhaul and modernize TTB’s 
 
39 In the case of beer products falling outside TTB’s FAA Act jurisdiction, we see a legitimate question 
as to TTB’s authority to mandate such disclosures, although we do not oppose them on policy 
grounds.  Notice 237 asserts that mandatory alcohol content labeling for non-FAA Act beers (a 
category including most fermented hard seltzers) is warranted as a means to protect the revenue and 
enhance revenue collection.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667.  We think this reasoning strains credulity.  
After all, and as already noted, alcohol beverage labels already contain numerous indicia that the 
products they identify are, in fact, alcoholic products subject to the federal excise tax.  Among other 
things, the mandatory Government Warning Statement would tip oƯ any taxpayer or TTB auditor 
about the presence of a taxable level of alcohol. 13 
 
outdated regulations on the labeling and advertising of “non-alcoholic” and 
“alcohol free” beverages.40  As TTB knows, consumer interest non-alcoholic beer 
has grown substantially in the past 7-8 years, and sales are increasing.  In January 
2020, the Brewers Association petitioned TTB to update its regulations governing 
such products, asking for common-sense changes in-line with the current market 
and consumers.  TTB’s failure to act on the petition for over five years cannot be 
explained.  We renew our call to modernize the regulations on labeling and 
advertising such products. 
 
Notice 237 inquires about where the alcohol content statement should appear.  In 
the case of malt beverage regulated under the FAA Act, if TTB mandates broader 
nutritional label disclosures on labels, then placement of alcohol content within the 
statement of other serving facts makes sense.  For added flexibility, however, we 
think industry members should have the option of placing alcohol content 
elsewhere on the label, provided that the information meets the regulations’ 
general requirements like those for prominence, minimum type size, and contrast.41 
 
8. TTB Should not Mandate a Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces42 
 
The concept of measures-of-alcohol-per-container labeling is unfamiliar to U.S. 
consumers.  This puts such information in marked contrast to familiar concepts like 
net contents and alcohol-by-volume measures.  The Brewers Association 
accordingly does not support a mandate for a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces 
and, if TTB proceeds with some of Notice 237’s disclosures, urges TTB to remove 
the alcohol in ounces requirement from any final rules. 
 
Consumers interested in moderating their intake understand that total alcohol 
intake is a function of volume and alcohol content.  As TTB regulations have 
mandated net content information for many decades, and many FAA Act-regulated 
products (all distilled spirits, most wine, some beer) have had to display alcohol 
content for many years, this is a control method familiar to consumers.  We are not 
aware of any significant confusion in using these measures. 
 
But labeling with a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces can lead to significant 
consumer confusion.  TTB’s labeling regulations, and those of its predecessors, 
have always put a premium on telling consumers the nature of the beverage in the 
container.43  Labeling that reduces all alcohol beverages to a single number will only 
tend to confuse consumers into viewing all alcohol beverages as the same.  This, of 
course, is not the case – each category (and indeed, class and type) of alcohol 
beverage has its own unique properties.  One-size fits all obscures this reality in a 
misleading manner. 
 
 
40 Currently at 27 C.F .R. § 7.65. 
41 See 27 C.F .R., Part 7, Subpart D. 
42 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.6., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6671. 
43 See, e.g., Statement of Joseph H. Choate, Jr., Hearings on HR. 8539 Before the Committee on Ways 
and Means, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935), at 10 (Act would provide the consumer with ""all the 
important factors which were of interest [to them] about what was in the bottle”). 14 
 
Of course, we believe the proponents in favor of alcohol in fluid ounce labeling aim 
for exactly the sort of confusion noted above.  The distilled spirits industry has long 
advocated for equating all alcohol beverages under a variety of slogans:  “A drink is 
a drink”; “equivalency”; etc.  Adopting this rhetoric will embrace a position in a 
longstanding policy debate that Congress, to date, has not embraced.  TTB should 
not make this leap. 
 
Notice 237 asks if its disclosures should reference the concept of a “standard 
drink” or otherwise reference the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans.  The Brewers Association would see such references as a substantial 
error.  As TTB knows, the Dietary Guidelines are updated every five years.  Indeed, as 
these comments are written,44 substantial uncertainty surrounds what the next 
iteration of the Dietary Guidelines (for 2025-2030) will have to say about alcohol.  
TTB should not require a labeling rule subject to revision – requiring costly new 
labels and other burdens on government resources and the industry – every five 
years. 
 
The proposed statement of alcohol in fluid ounces represents a significant and 
untested departure from longstanding policies designed to help consumers of 
alcohol beverages moderate their consumption.  TTB should remove this feature 
from any final mandatory disclosure rule. 
 
9. If Regulations are Adopted, a Linear Display and Partial Disclosure via 
Electronic Means Both Present Sound Options for Minimizing Regulatory 
Burdens45 
 
Should TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the Brewers Association 
supports the current proposal to permit industry members to display those in a 
linear display.  We do not view a text box as a significant improvement in visibility, 
and such a requirement would require far more extensive re-designs of industry 
member labels.  The Brewers Association also urges TTB to re-consider its decision 
not to permit nutritional disclosures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) by 
electronic means, as such a system would reduce burdens on industry and 
government, provide greater flexibility, and facilitate the export of U.S.-made 
products. 
 
A linear display gives producers more flexibility in designing their labels and avoids 
what would otherwise amount to a mandate for front-and-back labeling of 
products.  TTB’s experience is instructive – “light”/“lite” beer has been on the 
market for 45 years bearing the same nutritional information as proposed in Notice 
237.  Calories and carbohydrates constitute a central aspect of the inter-brand 
competition between such products.  Yet the statement of average analysis on a 
light beer appears in a linear display without any evidence, to our knowledge, that 
such information does not reach consumers, many of whom choose light beer 
precisely because of its reduced calories and/or carbohydrates.  We fail to see why 
 
44 In August 2025. 
45 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.7., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6672-73. 15 
 
a text box is needed when decades of experience demonstrates that a linear display 
is sufficient.  
 
Moreover, the amount of space on a beer label is quite finite.  Adding a mandatory 
text box will take up substantial room on the label and would force some producers 
to re-tool their labeling in order to accommodate the added space.  A brewer 
packaging in bottles, for example, might need to add back-labeling capabilities in 
order to accommodate an added text box.  Conversely, because the space on a 
beer bottle or can is limited, it seems hard to believe that consumers will struggle 
locating a linear display of nutritional information. 
 
Notice 237 asks whether TTB should abandon the maximum type size limitation on 
alcohol content statements for malt beverages.  We wholeheartedly agree with 
such a repeal.  As Notice 237 recognizes, alcohol content is important information 
to some consumers, helping them to regulate their alcohol intake.  The type size 
limitation appears to be a vestige from before the Supreme Court’s Rubin v. Coors 
decision,46 when the FAA Act prohibited alcohol content statements on malt 
beverages.  It is well-past the time to do away with the remnants of this paternalistic 
approach to malt beverage consumers. 
 
We also renew our call for TTB to provide for the electronic disclosure of nutritional 
information as an option for the industry.  An electronic disclosure option would 
strike the right balance between consumer transparency and avoiding undue 
burdens on businesses, especially small businesses.  TTB’s own figures show that 
even among groups with comparatively “low” access to smart phones, that access 
already reaches over three-quarters of the population.  According to the Pew 
Research Center, as of last year 91 percent of all American adults have smart 
phones, and 98 percent have a cell phone of some kind.47  Those numbers will only 
grow in the future.  Notably, the Pew Research data shows that smartphone 
penetration is lowest (at a still substantial 79%) among persons over 65 years of 
age, who tend to own non-“smart” cellphones in greater numbers.48  Today’s 65+ 
cohort, with their relative resistance to smartphone technology, will shrink over 
time.  Indeed, as the nutritional disclosures mandated by Notice 237 will not likely 
become mandatory until six or seven years after the close of the current comment 
period, smartphone ownership will likely be near-universal by the time any 
regulations become effective. 
 
An electronic solution disclosing nutritional information via QR code would ease the 
burden of Notice 237 on small businesses.  A QR code can accommodate 
variations of a recipe, whether inadvertent or deliberate, without the need to design 
and order new labels.  The brewer would simply update information linked to the QR 
code, saving substantial resources.  A QR code disclosure option also would permit 
brewers to provide this information in different formats (e.g., in European 
 
46 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995).

https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/ (last visited August 10, 2025). 
48 See id. 16 
 
measures) for different markets without the need to redesign labels.  This would 
help boost the competitiveness of American-brewed beer in foreign markets. 
 
10. If Regulations are Adopted, Reference Amounts Should be Adjusted to 
Reﬂect Typical Serving Sizes of Beer49 
 
The Brewers Association believes Notice 237 needs to adjust its proposed 
reference sizes for malt beverages, specifically the five-ounce reference size for 
products between 7% and 16% ABV.  Reviewing the proposed reference sizes, 
Notice 237 appears to embrace sizes more appropriate for wine products in this 
alcohol content range. 
 
The Brewers Association agrees that a 12-ounce reference size is appropriate for 
beer containing not more than 7% ABV.  But the standard twelve-ounce beer serving 
persists for stronger products than 7% ABV.  Most craft brewers have a retail 
component to their business, selling beer directly to the public.  Visiting almost any 
craft brewery will confirm that they do provide smaller pours for products 
somewhat above 7% ABV.  The dividing line, however, generally is set around 8% 
ABV.  We accordingly urge TTB to apply the 12-ounce reference amount to products 
containing not more than 8% ABV instead of 7% ABV. 
 
In addition, in observing the service of beer at craft breweries across the country, 
products in the 8% ABV to 16% ABV range are often served in different sizes, 
generally consistent with strength.  For products 8-12%, we believe an eight-ounce 
reference amount more accurately reflects the most typical pour size.  Then, for 
products containing more than 12% ABV but not more than 16% ABV, the five-
ounce reference amount proposed by Notice 237 appears appropriate.  For the 
strongest products, the Brewers Association agrees with Notice 237’s proposal of a 
two-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products in the above 16% to 24% ABV 
range, and a one-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products above 24% ABV. 
 
The Brewers Association does not see any merit in tying recommended serving sizes 
to any concept like a “standard drink.”  As explained in Section 8, above, 
concerning fluid ounces per drink, this concept is unknown to the American 
consumer.  Moreover, what constitutes a “standard drink” may be influenced by the 
Dietary Guidelines.  As such, the label rule might require revaluation every five years 
as the Dietary Guidelines evolve.  Industry needs more certainty than that. 
 
11. If Regulations are Adopted, we do Not See the Need to Further 
Complicate the Regulations with Speciﬁc Dual-Column Rules50 
 
The Brewers Association would not oppose the voluntary use of dual-column 
labeling by an industry member, provided that the information it displays is truthful 
and not misleading.  But we do not see a reason to further complicated the 
regulations with specific instructions governing what is simply the presentation of 
 
49 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.9., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. 
50 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.10., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. 17 
 
truthful, accurate, and specific “other information” on a label – something the 
existing malt beverage regulations already authorize.51 
 
Notice 237 asks whether a voluntary “dual column” rule should be allowed on 
containers containing 200-500% of the referenced amount or on containers 
containing 200-300% of the referenced amount (the FDA rule).  We believe such 
complexity is unnecessary, and producers should be able to choose either, so long 
as the information provided is truthful, accurate and specific.  Greater complexity 
with a rule governing a voluntary labeling decision will only serve as a “trap of the 
unwary.” 
 
12. If Regulations are Adopted, a Five-Year Implementation Period Will Help 
Mitigate its Impact on Small Businesses52 
 
Should TTB finalize a nutritional labeling rule, the Brewers Association supports a 
five-year compliance date.  Many small brewers update their labels at least once 
every five years, reducing the added cost burden of a final rule.  Nevertheless, some 
small and independent brewers will need to redesign labels outside their usual 
process.  In our survey of members, roughly one-third indicated that at least some 
of their labels do not change within a five-year cycle.  Another roughly one-third 
suggested that label redesigns are rare or infrequent but with less clarity on number 
of years, suggesting a longer time cycle for at least some of their labels. 
 
The Brewers Association also supports Notice 237’s proposal to allow the addition 
of nutritional information without the need for a new COLA.  Submitting and 
receiving label approval for a new COLA takes time and effort, and most small 
businesses do not have dedicated staff for such tasks.  Eliminating the need for this 
regulatory step would save both government and industry resources. 
 
Finally, today small and independent brewers, along with most of the alcohol 
beverage industry, face the prospect of three new federal labeling mandates: 
 
 The nutritional, alcohol content, and possibly other disclosures 
contemplated by Notice 237;  
 
 The mandatory allergen disclosures contemplated by TTB Notice 238;53 and 
 
 For alcohol beverages falling under FDA’s primary labeling jurisdiction, a 
front-of-label packaging mandate contemplated by FDA Docket No. FDA–
2024–N–2910.54 
 
The prospect of implementing different labeling changes at different times is 
daunting to any industry member, but particularly to small producers.  The Brewers

Association accordingly urges TTB to coordinate any implementation date for 
Notice 237 with the mandatory effective date of any final allergen regulations 
flowing from TTB Notice 238 and any FDA front-of-package mandate applicable to 
alcohol beverages.

Comments of the Beer Institute Regarding NPRM 237
This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 237, by which the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, 
calorie, and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels 
subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).
BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer 
importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more 
than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is 
committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal 
responsibility.
Brewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency
The beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, 
consumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to 
transparency through the Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading 
brewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to 
consume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling 
2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content 
and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program 
has been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest 
brewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an 
unparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers 
make responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences 
between distinct types of alcohol beverages.
As a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB 
Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If 
TTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and 
already well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could 
cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance 
costs would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already 
complies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.
What follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.
1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to 
consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the 
proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?2
B I  R e s p o n s e :  “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term 
“Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving 
Facts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, 
calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts 
descriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance 
costs by altering a widely used disclosure.
2. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens 
by requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” 
statement?  
BI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly 
for many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling 
2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.
3. Are consumers  accustomed  to ﬁnding  nutrient  content  information  in a Serving  Facts 
statement?  
BI Response: For over a decade,  many brewers  have voluntarily  included  the Serving  Facts 
statement  on their labels.
4. Would  changing  the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause  confusion?  
BI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  
reflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol content expressed as 
alcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure  placement  should  also be flexible  – either  as part 
of a Servings  Facts disclosure  or elsewhere  on the label, and the widely  understood  
abbreviation  “ABV” should  be permissible.
5. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish  
alcohol  beverages  from  other  food  items?  
BI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  
reflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol  content.  It is 
unnecessary  to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish  alcohol  beverages  from other food 
items,  as there are other sufficient  indicators  that the product  contains  alcohol  on the label. 
6. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement 
should be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to 3
the statement on a mandatory or optional basis. 
BI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ 
pledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. 
For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding 
nutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary 
packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard 
for disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and 
appropriate descriptor for these disclosures. 
7. TTB  speciﬁcally  seeks  comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling 
requirements with regulations  issued  by FDA,  as updated  in 2016.  
BI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for 
nutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage 
products (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics 
of alcohol beverages.
8. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any 
micronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that 
their disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB 
should require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients  on alcohol  beverage  labels.  
BI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom 
present in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be 
optional. 
9. TTB also seeks comments  on whether  certain  nutrients  should  be listed only if present  at 
speciﬁc  levels.  TTB is proposing  to require  the listing  of calories,  carbohydrate,  fat, and protein  
content  on alcohol  beverages,  even if the product  does not contain,  or contains  only a de 
minimis  amount  of, these components.  However,  TTB speciﬁcally  seeks comments  on whether  
fat and protein,  which  are not typically  found  in certain  alcohol  beverages,  should  be listed only 
if present  at speciﬁc  levels.  If so, what levels  should  trigger  these requirements?  TTB also seek 
comments  on whether  any other nutrients,  such as sodium,  caffeine,  or sugar,  should  be 
required  to be listed if present  at a speciﬁc  level, even if they do not otherwise have to be 
disclosed. 
BI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, 
and there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry 4
and understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or 
sugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.
10. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with 
the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?  
BI Response : No.  FDA  labeling  requirements  address  wider  public  policy  goals  for  the  
broader  food  category.  Requiring  a Nutrition  Facts  Label  on alcohol  beverage  products  
would  be overwhelming  relative  to the  limited  scope  of nutrient s in alcohol  beverages.  
11. Do the differences  between  alcohol  beverages  and other foods  make it 
unnecessary,  or even misleading,  to adopt  the type of nutrient  labeling  required  on food labels  
that are under  FDA’s labeling  jurisdiction?  
BI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol 
beverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also 
the answer to Items #12 and 13 below.
12. Would  information  on the percentage  of the daily value of the listed nutrients  
provided  by alcohol  beverages  be useful  information  for consumers?  
BI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of 
listed nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically 
consume alcohol beverages for nutrient value. 
13. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead 
consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their 
daily nutrient requirements? 
BI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do 
not consume  them for nutritive  value.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  restrict  or prohibit  health  
claims  concerning  alcohol  beverages .
14. For  greater  consistency  with  the  FDA  Nutrition  Facts  Label,  should  Alcohol  Facts  
statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) 
or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
BI Response : Statements  of Average  Analysis  and  Serving  Facts  labels  allowed  by TTB  
Ruling  2013-2 , and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have  long  been  in use,  are  5
familiar  to consumers,  and  provide  consumers  with  the  information  they  need  about  
alcohol  beverages.  Any  additional  information  should  be voluntary.
15. Would  the inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  to be found  in alcohol  
beverages  (such as trans-fat  and dietary  ﬁber) be useful  or potentially  misleading?  
BI Response : The inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  in alcohol  beverages  is of 
no utility  and could  be confusing  to consumers.  
16. Should  TTB allow numerical  statements  of the vitamin  and mineral  content  of 
alcohol  beverages,  assuming  the product  contains  vitamins  or minerals,  or could  such a 
statement  create  an erroneous  impression  that consumption  of the alcohol  beverage  has 
nutritional  value or other health-related  beneﬁts?  
BI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do 
not consume  them for their vitamin  or mineral  content.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  prohibit  
health  claims  for alcohol  beverage  products .
17. How many industry  members  already  provide  nutrient  content  information  on 
labels,  in advertisements  (such as websites),  or upon request  (for example,  to consumers  or 
restaurants)? 
BI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest 
brewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with 
twelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and 
nutrient content information on request.
18. Do  consumers  want  to see  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  on alcohol  beverage  products?  
How  might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information 
about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include  
Alcohol  Facts  labeling?  How  do those  beneﬁts  compare  to the  costs  and  regulatory  burdens  
associated  with  such  revisions?  
BI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling 
80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other 
alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer 
and VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became 
mandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently 
accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, 
compliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the 6
marketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.
19. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the 
alcohol  beverage  market?  
BI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI 
believes enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market. 
20. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, 
in particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace? 
BI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already 
includes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s 
proposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering 
the alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended 
time basis, should help with planning and execution.
21. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect  
international  trade  of alcohol  beverages?  
BI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to 
alter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year 
implementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, 
nutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these 
labeling requirements. 
22. TTB is proposing  to modify  the tolerances  set out in the 2020 guidance  by 
eliminating  references  to ""reasonable  ranges""  based  on ""good  manufacturing  practice  
limitations.""  Instead,  TTB is proposing  an objective  standard,  which  allows  a tolerance  of 20 
percent  either  above  or below  the labeled  amount  for calories,  carbohydrates,  protein,  and 
fat….  TTB seeks comments  on whether  the proposed  tolerances  are broad  enough  to facilitate  
reliance  on databases  for standard  products,  among  other methods  for calculating  calorie  and 
nutrient  content,  but still speciﬁc  enough  to provide  accurate  information  to consumers.  
Speciﬁcally,  TTB seeks comments  on whether  it should  instead  propose  the same tolerances  set 
forth in TTB Procedure  2020-1  or whether  another  approach  should  be considered.  
BI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several 
years. Its continued application is appropriate. 7
23. For beers that are not deﬁned  as “malt beverages”  under  the FAA Act, TTB is proposing  
to mandate  an alcohol  content  statement  on the label of the products  under  TTB’s IRC authority.  
However,  these beers would  not be subject  to the proposed  Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements,  
including  the requirement  for a statement  of the number  of ﬂuid ounces  of pure ethyl alcohol  per 
serving,  because  the Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements  are being proposed  under  TTB’s FAA Act 
authority,  which  does not apply to these products.  Instead,  these products  are subject  to FDA labeling  
requirements.  TTB believes  that requiring  an alcohol  content  statement  on these products  would  
facilitate  revenue.  The Beer Institute  and the Brewers  Association  made  substantially  similar  comments  
in response  to Notice  No. 232. protection  by, among  other things,  making  it readily  apparent  that the 
products  are subject  to tax under  the IRC. TTB seeks comments  on this issue.  TTB also seeks comment  
on the proposal  to increase  the labeling  tolerance  to one percentage  point above  or below  the stated  
amount  for all malt beverages  and beers.  TTB seeks comment  on whether  increasing  the tolerance  for 
alcohol  content  to one percent  would  lower  the cost of compliance  for a mandatory  alcohol  content  
disclosure  and thereby  promote  competition  in the marketplace  if such disclosure  is required.  TTB also 
seeks comment  on whether  consumers  would  receive  adequate  information  about  the alcohol  content  
of malt beverages  if the tolerance  were increased.  
BI Response : Applying  a basic alcohol  disclosure  standard  – like the mandatory  and 
voluntary  standards  already  in place and adding  alcohol  by volume  to all “IRC Alcohol  
beverages”  is appropriate  and consistent  with the goals of consumer-centric  disclosures.  
Flexibility  in the location  of disclosure  is essential.  Furthermore,  alcohol  by volume  is the form 
of alcohol  content  disclosure  that consumers  recognize  and understand  across  all types of 
alcohol.  Adding  fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if 
mandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.
As for increasing  the labeling  tolerance  for malt beverages  from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues  
to caution  against  this change,  as there is substantial  risk of misinforming  consumers  about  the 
alcohol  content  of malt beverages.  If TTB believes  an increase  in tolerance  is appropriate  for 
malt beverages,  BI suggests  increasing  the tolerance  from .3% to .5%, providing  greater  
flexibility  to brewers  while still providing  accurate  information  about  the alcohol  content  they 
are consuming.  
  
24. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether 
an Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages. 
BI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-
alcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement's 
location.8
25. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a 
requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, 
on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? 
BI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is 
valuable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. 
Alcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional 
statements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither 
straightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional 
statements of alcohol content on labels. 
26. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt 
beverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small  
businesses?  
BI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to 
comply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly 
high or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (e.g., 5 years). A 
“fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater 
burden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.
27. Will the proposed  increase  in alcohol  content  tolerances  for malt beverages  
mislead  consumers?  
BI Response : An increase  in alcohol  content  tolerance  from .3% to 1.0% is too much  and 
will misinform  consumers  when  a producer  uses the full tolerance.  If TTB believes  it must 
provide  additional  flexibility,  BI recommends  only a minor  increase  in the tolerance  level, such 
as from .3% to .5%.
28. Do the proposed  labeling  requirements  for non-alcoholic  malt beverages  
adequately  advise  the consumer  that the products  contain  less than 0.5 percent  alcohol  by 
volume?  
BI Response : Yes.
29. Should  non-alcoholic  malt beverages  be exempted  from calorie  and nutrient  
labeling  requirements?  
BI Response : No.9
30. Would  an alternative  that allowed  table wines  to indicate  alcohol  content  as a 
range  (e.g., 7–14 percent  alcohol  by volume)  place less of a burden  on small wineries  and 
importers?  Would  this approach  provide  sufficient  information  to consumers?  
BI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any 
alcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.
31. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label 
if it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why?
BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts 
disclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize 
additional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.
32. Alternatively,  should  TTB allow alcohol  content  labeling  as an optional  element  of 
the Alcohol  Facts statement?
BI Response : TTB should  require  disclosure  of alcohol  content,  expressed  as alcohol  by 
volume,  on labels,  with the flexibility  of placing  it as part of a Serving  Facts disclosure  or 
elsewhere  on the label.
33. Does the placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  compliance  costs and 
regulatory  burdens?  If so, how?
BI Response : Disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  with flexibility  in placement  should  not 
materially  increase  compliance  costs or regulatory burdens.
34. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol 
Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or 
international  standards?  
BI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  
affecting  competition . However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include 
alcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format. 
35. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label 
if it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why? 
BI Response : Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts 
disclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.10
36. Should  TTB allow the use of alcohol  per serving  as an optional  element  of the 
Alcohol  Facts statement?
BI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules 
with the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition 
disclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and 
distilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that 
matches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” 
measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” 
is merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the 
reality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a 
device used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of 
communicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.
37. Does  the  placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  costs  of compliance  
and  regulatory  burdens?  
BI Response : Yes,  if the  placement  or form  of alcohol  content  information  changes.  The  
industry  is well-positioned  to continue  reflecting  Serving  Facts  information  on primary  and  
secondary  packaging  or near  the  net  contents  information  on both  primary  and  secondary  
packaging  display  panels.  However,  compliance  costs  and  regulatory  burden  will  increase  if 
the  requirements  change.
38. Does the proposal  to require  alcohol  content  information  as part of the Alcohol  
Facts statement  affect  competition  or issues  addressed  by international  trade agreements  or 
international  standards?  
BI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  
affecting  competition .
39. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving 
in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the 
consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so 
choose?
BI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not 
provide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only 
serve to confuse consumers. Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  
for a single  serving.  This reference  amount  for beer and a disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  
provide  the information  consumers  need to follow  consumption  and moderation  advice.  11
40. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving 
in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage 
manufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?
BI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the 
majority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements 
expressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse 
consumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; 
therefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection. 
41. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? 
Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid 
ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?
BI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the 
simplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they 
purchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers 
already understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, 
express alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of 
providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard 
drinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between 
malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for 
all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard 
drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.
42. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms 
“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms 
should be used or defined for use on labels. 
BI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage 
labels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a 
12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to 
moderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer. 
43. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that 
information  is presented  in a linear  display?  
BI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average 
analysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since 
alcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels. 12
44. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol 
Facts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information? 
BI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern 
to the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the 
term “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, 
we would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.
45. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear 
display that is not surrounded by a box? 
BI Response: Yes. 
46. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the 
type size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels? 
BI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.
47. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, 
affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting 
requirements?
BI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other 
regulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been 
following TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs 
by changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures. 
48. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of 
alcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement? 
BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current 
minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.
49. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol 
content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well? 
BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum 
and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.
50. What alternatives  exist to convey  Alcohol  Facts information  to consumers?  13
BI Response : TTB might  consider  allowing  QR codes  for voluntary disclosures only. 
51. How, if it all, would  the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as 
compared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label? 
BI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the 
marketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the 
products they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market 
may be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for 
mandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information 
only.
52. What are the costs and beneﬁts  of aligning  Alcohol  Facts information  to 
requirements  of other countries?  
BI Response : BI sees no benefits  to aligning  nutrition  and alcohol  content  disclosures  in the 
United  States  with requirements  from other countries  with different  laws and regulatory  
structures.  The costs of compliance  and regulatory  burden  would  increase,  and consumers  in 
the U.S. may be more confused  than informed  by labeling  requirements  imported  from other 
markets.  
53. If TTB adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts labeling  for alcohol  beverages,  should  it 
include  the option  of satisfying  the requirement  by making  the information  available  
electronically,  for example  by including  a QR code or website  address  on the label to allow 
consumers  to view mandatory  Alcohol  Facts statements  on their mobile  devices  instead  of on 
the product  label?  
BI Response : Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.
54. Would  this option  provide  consumers  with sufficient  access  to Alcohol  Facts 
information  at the retail store so that they can make informed  decisions,  given issues  such as 
the need to use a smartphone,  potential  issues  regarding  the adequacy  of cellular  or Wi-Fi 
coverage  at some retail stores,  and other potential  technological  challenges?  Would  the 
provision  of mandatory  information  disclosures  via electronic  means  create  disproportional  
barriers  to access  for particular  communities?  
BI Response : Mandatory  disclosures  should  be on the label. TTB should  limit the use of 
electronic  disclosures  to voluntary  information  disclosures  only. 14
55. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via 
electronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? 
BI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means 
would decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information 
should be on the label.
56. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB 
allow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should 
some of the information be required to appear on the physical label? 
BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, 
however, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means. 
57. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, 
could the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion? 
BI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and 
alcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this 
information about all alcohol products.
58. Are the proposed  reference  amounts  a reasonably  accurate  representation  of the 
amount  of the product  customarily  consumed  as a single  serving?  
BI Response : Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  as a single  
serving.  
59. What data or other information  should  TTB consider  that would  give a better  
estimate  of the amount  customarily  consumed  for a speciﬁc  product  category?
BI Response : Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single 
serving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer. 
60. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth 
in TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages,  
regardless  of the  alcohol  content)?  Why  or why  not?  
BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single 
serving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, 
a cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for 15
accurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry 
sectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do 
not understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure 
beneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.
61. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes? 
BI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB 
Ruling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.
62. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink 
equivalent  of 0.6  ﬂuid  ounces  of alcohol,  or would  this  mislead  consumers  by not  recognizing 
how alcohol beverages are typically consumed? 
BI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is 
misleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour 
or drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that 
is more useful than the existing approach.
63. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings 
of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?
BI Response: No.
64. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, 
consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way 
in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled? 
BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 
2013-2, except to make them mandatory. 
65. Should  dual-column  displays  be allowed  on any container,  regardless  of the number  
of servings  in that container,  consistent  with TTB Ruling  2013–2? The proposed  rule would  
require  containers  with a net content  of more than 100 percent  but less than 200 percent  of a 
single  serving  size reference  amount  to be labeled  as containing  a single  serving.  TTB solicits  
comments  on whether  this is the best way to convey  the alcohol  and nutrient  content  of these 
products  to consumers.  
BI Response: There  is no good reason  to change  the current  voluntary  standards  of TTB 
Ruling  2013-2,  except  to make them mandatory.  16
66. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change 
labels? 
BI Response : It depends  on the  products.  There  are  products  in the  marketplace  with  
labels  that  have  remained  unchanged  for  several  years.  Some  of those  products  already  
comply  with  TTB  Ruling  2013-2,  while  other  labels  will  not  change  unless  the  requirements  
change.
67. How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed 
rule?
 
BI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our 
experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.
68. Will 5 years provide  enough  time for small businesses  to coordinate  labeling  
changes  required  by regulatory  changes  with labeling  changes  that are planned  in the ordinary  
course  of business?  
BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years 
is sufficient time to expect compliance.
69. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be 
2 years,  3 years,  or another  length  of time?  
BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years 
is sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate. 
70. If a ﬁnal rule is issued,  will industry  members  begin implementation  of the labeling  
changes  in advance  of the compliance  date?  
BI Response : Industry  members  are likely to begin complying  on a rolling  basis,  changing  
labels  in the normal  course  of business.  If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most 
of the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient 
time to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.
Conclusion
As noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly 
encourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as 17
outlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 
2013-2 and BI’s comments above.
If there are issues for which the TTB sought comment in NPRM 237 that BI does not explicitly address

This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 237, by which the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).

BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal responsibility.

Brewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency

The beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, consumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to transparency through the [Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI](https://www.beerinstitute.org/policy-responsibility/policy/voluntary-disclosure/)). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading brewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to consume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program has been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an unparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers make responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences between distinct types of alcohol beverages.

As a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If TTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance costs would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already complies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.

What follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.

* 1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?

BI Response: “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term “Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving Facts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts descriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance costs by altering a widely used disclosure.

* 1. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens by requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” statement?

BI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly for many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling 2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.

* 1. Are consumers accustomed to ﬁnding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement?

BI Response: For over a decade, many brewers have voluntarily included the Serving Facts statement on their labels.

* 1. Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?

BI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure placement should also be flexible – either as part of a Servings Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label, and the widely understood abbreviation “ABV” should be permissible.

* 1. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?

BI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content. It is unnecessary to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, as there are other sufficient indicators that the product contains alcohol on the label.

* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement should be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to the statement on a mandatory or optional basis.

BI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ pledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard for disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and appropriate descriptor for these disclosures.

* 1. TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling requirements with regulations issued by FDA, as updated in 2016.

BI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for nutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage products (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics of alcohol beverages.

* 1. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any micronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that their disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB should require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients on alcohol beverage labels.

BI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom present in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be optional.

* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. TTB is proposing to require the listing of calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein content on alcohol beverages, even if the product does not contain, or contains only a de minimis amount of, these components. However, TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether fat and protein, which are not typically found in certain alcohol beverages, should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. If so, what levels should trigger these requirements? TTB also seek comments on whether any other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, should be required to be listed if present at a speciﬁc level, even if they do not otherwise have to be disclosed.

BI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry and understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.

* 1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?

BI Response: No. FDA labeling requirements address wider public policy goals for the broader food category. Requiring a Nutrition Facts Label on alcohol beverage products would be overwhelming relative to the limited scope of nutrients in alcohol beverages.

* 1. Do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?

BI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol beverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also the answer to Items #12 and 13 below.

* 1. Would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers?

BI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of listed nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically consume alcohol beverages for nutrient value.

* 1. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?

BI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for nutritive value. Moreover, existing regulations restrict or prohibit health claims concerning alcohol beverages.

* 1. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?

BI Response: Statements of Average Analysis and Serving Facts labels allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2, and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have long been in use, are familiar to consumers, and provide consumers with the information they need about alcohol beverages. Any additional information should be voluntary.

* 1. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary ﬁber) be useful or potentially misleading?

BI Response: The inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected in alcohol beverages is of no utility and could be confusing to consumers.

* 1. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts?

BI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for their vitamin or mineral content. Moreover, existing regulations prohibit health claims for alcohol beverage products.

* 1. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)?

# BI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest brewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with twelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and nutrient content information on request.

* 1. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? How do those beneﬁts compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with such revisions?

BI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer and VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became mandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, compliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the marketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.

* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol beverage market?

BI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI believes enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market.

* 1. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace?

BI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already includes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s proposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering the alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended time basis, should help with planning and execution.

* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of alcohol beverages?

BI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to alter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year implementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, nutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these labeling requirements.

* 1. TTB is proposing to modify the tolerances set out in the 2020 guidance by eliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice limitations."" Instead, TTB is proposing an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat…. TTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Speciﬁcally, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set forth in TTB Procedure 2020-1 or whether another approach should be considered.

BI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several years. Its continued application is appropriate.

* 1. For beers that are not deﬁned as “malt beverages” under the FAA Act, TTB is proposing to mandate an alcohol content statement on the label of the products under TTB’s IRC authority. However, these beers would not be subject to the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements, including the requirement for a statement of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, because the Alcohol Facts labeling requirements are being proposed under TTB’s FAA Act authority, which does not apply to these products. Instead, these products are subject to FDA labeling requirements. TTB believes that requiring an alcohol content statement on these products would facilitate revenue. The Beer Institute and the Brewers Association made substantially similar comments in response to Notice No. 232. protection by, among other things, making it readily apparent that the products are subject to tax under the IRC. TTB seeks comments on this issue. TTB also seeks comment on the proposal to increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the stated amount for all malt beverages and beers. TTB seeks comment on whether increasing the tolerance for alcohol content to one percent would lower the cost of compliance for a mandatory alcohol content disclosure and thereby promote competition in the marketplace if such disclosure is required. TTB also seeks comment on whether consumers would receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance were increased.

BI Response: Applying a basic alcohol disclosure standard – like the mandatory and voluntary standards already in place and adding alcohol by volume to all “IRC Alcohol beverages” is appropriate and consistent with the goals of consumer-centric disclosures. Flexibility in the location of disclosure is essential. Furthermore, alcohol by volume is the form of alcohol content disclosure that consumers recognize and understand across all types of alcohol. Adding fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if mandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.

As for increasing the labeling tolerance for malt beverages from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues to caution against this change, as there is substantial risk of misinforming consumers about the alcohol content of malt beverages. If TTB believes an increase in tolerance is appropriate for malt beverages, BI suggests increasing the tolerance from .3% to .5%, providing greater flexibility to brewers while still providing accurate information about the alcohol content they are consuming.

* 1. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether an Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages.

BI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-alcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement's location.

* 1. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products?

BI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is valuable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. Alcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional statements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither straightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional statements of alcohol content on labels.

* 1. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt beverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small businesses?

BI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to comply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly high or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (*e.g.,* 5 years). A “fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater burden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.

* 1. Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers?

BI Response: An increase in alcohol content tolerance from .3% to 1.0% is too much and will misinform consumers when a producer uses the full tolerance. If TTB believes it must provide additional flexibility, BI recommends only a minor increase in the tolerance level, such as from .3% to .5%.

* 1. Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume?

BI Response: Yes.

* 1. Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements?

BI Response: No.

* 1. Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers?

BI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any alcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.

* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize additional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.

* 1. Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: TTB should require disclosure of alcohol content, expressed as alcohol by volume, on labels, with the flexibility of placing it as part of a Serving Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label.

* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect compliance costs and regulatory burdens? If so, how?

BI Response: Disclosure of alcohol by volume with flexibility in placement should not materially increase compliance costs or regulatory burdens.

* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?

BI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition. However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include alcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format.

* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

BI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.

* 1. Should TTB allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” is merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the reality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a device used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of communicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.

* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect costs of compliance and regulatory burdens?

BI Response: Yes, if the placement or form of alcohol content information changes. The industry is well-positioned to continue reflecting Serving Facts information on primary and secondary packaging or near the net contents information on both primary and secondary packaging display panels. However, compliance costs and regulatory burden will increase if the requirements change.

* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?

BI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition.

* 1. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?

BI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not provide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only serve to confuse consumers. Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended for a single serving. This reference amount for beer and a disclosure of alcohol by volume provide the information consumers need to follow consumption and moderation advice.

* 1. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage manufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?

BI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the majority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements expressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse consumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; therefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection.

* 1. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?

BI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the simplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they purchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers already understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, express alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard drinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.

* 1. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.

BI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage labels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a 12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to moderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer.

* 1. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that information is presented in a linear display?

BI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average analysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since alcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels.

* 1. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information?

BI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern to the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the term “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, we would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.

* 1. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear display that is not surrounded by a box?

BI Response: Yes.

* 1. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the type size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels?

BI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.

* 1. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting requirements?

BI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other regulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been following TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs by changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures.

* 1. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement?

BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.

* 1. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well?

BI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.

* 1. What alternatives exist to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers?

BI Response: TTB might consider allowing QR codes for voluntary disclosures only.

* 1. How, if it all, would the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as compared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label?

BI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the marketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the products they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market may be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for mandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information only.

* 1. What are the costs and beneﬁts of aligning Alcohol Facts information to requirements of other countries?

BI Response: BI sees no benefits to aligning nutrition and alcohol content disclosures in the United States with requirements from other countries with different laws and regulatory structures. The costs of compliance and regulatory burden would increase, and consumers in the U.S. may be more confused than informed by labeling requirements imported from other markets.

* 1. If TTB adopts mandatory Alcohol Facts labeling for alcohol beverages, should it include the option of satisfying the requirement by making the information available electronically, for example by including a QR code or website address on the label to allow consumers to view mandatory Alcohol Facts statements on their mobile devices instead of on the product label?

BI Response: Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.

* 1. Would this option provide consumers with sufficient access to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, given issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges? Would the provision of mandatory information disclosures via electronic means create disproportional barriers to access for particular communities?

BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the label. TTB should limit the use of electronic disclosures to voluntary information disclosures only.

* 1. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via electronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens?

BI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means would decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information should be on the label.

* 1. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB allow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should some of the information be required to appear on the physical label?

BI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, however, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means.

* 1. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, could the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion?

BI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and alcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this information about all alcohol products.

* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts a reasonably accurate representation of the amount of the product customarily consumed as a single serving?

BI Response: Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended as a single serving.

* 1. What data or other information should TTB consider that would give a better estimate of the amount customarily consumed for a speciﬁc product category?

BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer.

* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol content)? Why or why not?

BI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, a cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for accurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry sectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do not understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure beneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.

* 1. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes?

BI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.

* 1. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 ﬂuid ounces of alcohol, or would this mislead consumers by not recognizing how alcohol beverages are typically consumed?

BI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is misleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour or drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that is more useful than the existing approach.

* 1. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?

BI Response: No.

* 1. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?

BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.

* 1. Should dual-column displays be allowed on any container, regardless of the number of servings in that container, consistent with TTB Ruling 2013–2? The proposed rule would require containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving. TTB solicits comments on whether this is the best way to convey the alcohol and nutrient content of these products to consumers.

BI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.

* 1. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change labels?

BI Response: It depends on the products. There are products in the marketplace with labels that have remained unchanged for several years. Some of those products already comply with TTB Ruling 2013-2, while other labels will not change unless the requirements change.

# How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule?

#

# BI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.

* 1. Will 5 years provide enough time for small businesses to coordinate labeling changes required by regulatory changes with labeling changes that are planned in the ordinary course of business?

BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.

* 1. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be 2 years, 3 years, or another length of time?

BI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate.

* 1. If a ﬁnal rule is issued, will industry members begin implementation of the labeling changes in advance of the compliance date?

BI Response: Industry members are likely to begin complying on a rolling basis, changing labels in the normal course of business. If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most of the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.

Conclusion

As noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly encourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as outlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 and BI’s comments above.

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(Notice No. 237; Docket No. TTB–202–0005) (90 Fed. Reg. 6654 (January 17, 2025)) 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
On behalf of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), a national trade 
association representing the nation’s leading distillers of all sizes and marketers of distilled 
spirits sold in the United States, we appreciate the opportunity to comment upon the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) “Alcohol Facts” notice of proposed rulemaking and 
look forward to a thoughtful evaluation by TTB as you consider regulations on this important 
labeling proposal.  
 
As regulated producers, importers, and marketers of distilled spirits, we share the goal of TTB 
and the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act of providing consumers with meaningful 
information about the beverages they choose to purchase. It is from that shared objective that 
we respectfully submit our views regarding the instant notice and it is for those reasons that we 
do not support the Bureau's ""Alcohol Facts"" proposal as drafted either as an option or a 
mandatory requirement on container labels.  
 
Of particular note, we urge the Bureau to consider the following key points: 
• Flexibility to electronically display Alcohol Facts information is critical;  
• Anticipated costs associated will be signiﬁcant and not commensurate with the beneﬁts; 
• Standard drink metrics should be the preferred method of providing alcohol 
information; and 
• TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts in the nutrient content statements will 
create consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. 
 
It is without doubt that this notice of proposed rulemaking is one of the most signiﬁcant 
undertakings by the Bureau in the last 20 years. It is critical that TTB promulgates a ﬁnal rule 
that serves the public's interests, while also ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden 
distillers, overwhelm agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confuse consumers. We believe this

proposal, if adopted, would not meet these objectives and urge the Bureau to reconsider 
certain aspects to increase supplier ﬂexibility, reduce the ﬁnancial impact, and enhance 
consumer clarity.  
 
Below we expound on these points and provide additional context that we hope the Bureau will 
consider as it progresses with this rulemaking and its other labeling initiatives.   
 
Areas of Greatest Concern 
 
1. Flexibility to Electronically Display Alcohol Facts Information Is Critical to the Success of This 
Proposal  
 
If the Bureau wishes to ﬁnalize an actionable standard that can be accessible for consumers and 
implemented without overburdening industry members, any new regulations should, at a 
minimum, allow for the ﬂexibility to use quick response (QR) code technology or website 
references on label to provide this information. As we heard during the listening sessions and in 
the written comment period last year, the industry, both domestic and international, almost 
unanimously registered support for additional ﬂexibility, with regard to the use of QR codes or 
website references, and detailed why this ﬂexibility was warranted and necessary. DISCUS 
strongly urges the Bureau to consider introducing a QR code and/or website reference option 
into this proposal.   
 
Allowing the use of QR codes would signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬁnancial burdens for industry 
members to comply, provide eﬃciencies as they are already being utilized on bottles in the 
United States and across multiple international marketplaces for this purpose and can be geo-
tagged for individual markets, and permit producers to quickly change the information without 
needing to revise logistics and supply chain.  
 
Speciﬁc considerations regarding electronic display of Alcohol Facts information include: 
 
A. QR Codes Are Eﬀective, Consumer Friendly, and Would Not Disadvantage Certain 
Communities 
 
While we understand and appreciate that the Bureau considered the issue of QR codes in 
response to comments received during the advance notice of proposed rulemaking last year 
and decided not to include a QR code option due to a concern that it “would create barriers for 
consumer access, particularly for consumers in certain demographics and those living in rural 
areas,”
1 we believe that these perceived barriers are not as large or insurmountable as others 
have argued and that QR codes can be an accessible and sustainable source of providing 
important product information to consumers. From a consumer perspective, we believe using a 
QR code to access e-labels allows producers to provide the consumer with the requisite 
 
1 90 Fed. Reg. at 6671. Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 3 
 
   
 
information, and in many cases, with even more fulsome detail than a physical label would be 
able to accommodate. For example, a 50 ml bottle can comfortably accommodate a QR code 
but would not be able to ﬁt the proposed label and all of the other information required by 
both federal and growing state regulations.  
 
Largely due to the rapid expansion of QR codes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic over 
the last ﬁve years, consumers have become extremely comfortable accessing important product 
information in this format for all sorts of consumer brands and services. Consumers are 
increasingly aware that much more information than is shown on the product label can be 
found by simply going to the brand’s website or scanning a QR code on the packaging. Indeed, it 
is now common for a consumer to look up a product online on their smartphone while in the 
store shopping, rather than picking up the product to examine the label. 
 
In the NPRM, TTB questions whether QR codes “[w]ould…provide consumers with suﬃcient 
access to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, 
given issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of 
cellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges.”
2 
We would argue this format of presenting information is not prohibitive for today’s or 
tomorrow’s consumer, as according to Pew Research,3 over 90% of adult Americans own a 
smartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet. In fact, many Americans can be 
considered “smartphone-dependent,” meaning digital is often the primary information pathway. 
 
Even amongst senior citizens, cellphone ownership is strong. In 2023, Consumer Aﬀairs found 
that the vast majority of seniors own cell phones (94%) or smartphones (76%).
4 Smartphone 
ownership is only expected to grow as well, with future trends predicting that the number of 
American smartphone users will increase to more than 364 million people by 2040.5 Regarding 
cell service, the three largest phone carriers today, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, each claim that 
their 4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the U.S. population, so consumers in both urban 
and rural areas should have the requisite cell service necessary to scan a QR code at the retail 
store no matter where they are in the United States. One can only expect that by 2030, when 
this ﬁnal rule would likely go into eﬀect, that these cell coverages and ﬁgures will have markedly 
increased, further closing any potential gap in accessibility for QR codes in all parts of the 
country.

Regarding concerns over those who do not own a smartphone being able to access this 
information if only available through QR code, many larger stores have scanning kiosks 
customers can use to learn more about products and consumers could always ask retail 
employees for help accessing the information as well. No method of transmitting product 
information will be 100% accessible, however, as even on-label disclosures are not universally 
accessible for every community given language barriers, literacy challenges, or consumers that 
might be visually impaired. QR code accessibility can actually help to close these gaps by 
providing product information in diﬀerent languages and allowing auditory text-to-speech 
access on devices.  
 
Our position that QR codes would be accessible and beneﬁcial for consumers is not just based 
on theory—these QR codes containing nutrient content information are currently deployed in 
retail locations across a wide variety of markets, including the United States. Based on one 
DISCUS member’s recent data, U.S. consumers are their most active QR scanning population 
across markets, making up 18% of all scanners worldwide. In December 2024 alone, over 15,000 
individuals scanned just one company’s distilled spirits QR codes in the United States.   
 
QR codes provide consumers with the ability to make even more informed purchasing decisions 
because they would potentially have access to more information than they would if information 
was limited to what was physically available on pack, given space constraints. Based on member 
experience with QR codes and electronic labels (""e-labels"") in other markets, we believe QR 
codes provide consumers with suﬃcient access to Alcohol Facts information at retail without 
creating disproportional barriers to access for particular communities. One member indicated 
that they currently utilize QR codes across their entire portfolio for consumers to access e-
labels, and they have been successfully implemented on over half a billion bottles across 166 
markets with tailor-made information in local languages to ensure consumer accessibility. These 
e-labels link to webpages that can include, for example, (i) information about the moderate 
consumption guidelines issued by regional health authorities where the QR code is scanned, (ii) 
the full list of nutritional information per portion and per 100 mL, (iii) basic information about 
the company and relevant brand for the purpose of education, and more. 
 
In that same paragraph of the NPRM referenced above, TTB “recognizes that access to 
technology and cultural norms surrounding the provision of information via electronic means 
are rapidly advancing and seeks comment on whether any ﬁnal rule should allow the proposed 
Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means.”
6 If you looked back to 
consumer QR code usage pre-2020, the numbers would look very diﬀerent to their level of 
integration and usage now. By 2030, we may experience another leap in technological 
accessibility that accelerates the consumer experience with QR codes and cements the e-label’s

role in providing valuable product information across all consumer goods. This potential 
outcome is far more likely than seeing a decrease in digitally-communicated consumer product 
information.  
 
Additionally, overcrowded labels have been shown to not be helpful for consumers and do not 
serve the need of adequately informing them regarding product details or components. This is 
especially salient for small container sizes, like 50ml bottles. Thus, requiring this additional 
information, in conjunction with other potential labelling details, such as allergens and 
ingredients, to be placed on label could have the opposite eﬀect, whereby consumers simply 
tune out all information provided. Introducing such a requirement would be especially 
burdensome for small producers. In order to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry and the 
resulting reduced choice for consumers, regulation should not be overly prescriptive in terms of 
format or compliance mechanisms. Rules should be easy to apply even for the smallest operator 
and should acknowledge the dominant mechanism consumers employ for learning about 
product information is via online searching.  
 
If the Bureau ultimately decides to allow QR code nutrient content statements, standards could 
be set requiring explanatory text to accompany the QR code on-label, as well as how the 
resulting QR code website should appear. This might provide TTB more comfort that there is a 
more uniform method of encountering this information on-label and on the ultimate landing 
page to help manage the consumer experience and expectations.  
 
B. QR Codes Promote International Eﬃciencies, Export Potential & Geo Sensitivity  
 
The ﬂexibility QR codes allow also provides important international eﬃciencies and growth 
opportunities to more U.S. distillers by allowing for greater expansion into export markets. For 
example, QR codes are sophisticated enough now to be made “geo sensitive,” allowing for 
diﬀerent languages or information to be displayed based on the location where it is scanned.  
 
This ﬂexibility would also facilitate consistency across European markets, given the newly 
implemented wine regulations and spirits commitment to place certain nutrient information on 
websites that can be accessed via a QR code on label. Other parts of the world also have 
diﬀerent requirements than those proposed in the NPRM, and adoption of this rule will increase 
the probability that U.S. labels aren't accepted into other markets, thereby requiring additional 
stickering or an even more burdensome process of relabeling bottles altogether. This, in turn, 
will cause the management of additional SKUs and label creation, which equates to additional 
cost to bring products into international markets. These amount to market barriers that 
dissuade new entrants and directly impact competition.  
 
As spiritsEUROPE notes in their comment in this docket, the EU spirits sector created an 
ambitious self-regulatory approach to provide consumers with energy information included on 
the back label and the full nutrient content information (including fat, carbohydrates and Ms. Amy Greenberg

protein) made available via a QR code present on the label. spiritsEUROPE’s latest report on the 
implementation of the provision of this nutrition information from June 2024 shows that the 
share of spirits with on-pack energy information and a QR Code has grown from 0% to 70% in 
just 5 years. In addition, over 900 spirits producers in the EU have created and activated close to 
40,000 QR code labels. They report that more than 75% of all spirits volume sold will feature e-
labels by the end of 2025 and that companies are also increasingly mirroring this approach 
outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. Having this ﬂexibility in the EU to use QR codes, while 
requiring all information on-pack here in the U.S. could have very real impacts on production 
eﬃciencies and create undue ﬁnancial burdens for all companies participating in both markets.  
 
Aligning U.S. and EU requirements on displaying nutrient content information would be 
incredibly beneﬁcial for producers on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since the EU 
requirements for wine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well 
beyond the EU. Companies are already fully integrated into the QR space internationally and 
any large-scale deviation, particularly in the largest marketplace, would send shockwaves 
around the world and amongst the companies who have both U.S. and European brands.  
 
C. QR Codes Promote Sustainable Practices and Cut Down on Label Waste 
 
A QR code or website option results in production eﬃciencies for distillers that provide this 
information in multiple markets around the world and also allows for greater ﬂexibility in 
making any necessary changes to the nutrient or ingredient information. With on-label 
declarations, if anything changes in the product formulation, it would require a large-scale 
logistical eﬀort to reprint the labels that can take years to implement, swap out product in the 
marketplace, and change marketing campaigns. Whereas with information provided via a QR 
code or website, a change can be completed in real time with no physical waste through a 
simple revision of the text on the webpage.  
 
These options help reduce unnecessary waste—allowing for this digital labeling could help save 
hundreds of thousands of labels, point-of-sale materials, and other marketing materials from 
being sent to the landﬁll anytime a product formulation changes. From a design and 
sustainability perspective, our members aim to reduce the size of paper labels across all 
products to minimize the materials used and impact on our environment. Utilizing QR codes 
instead of Alcohol Facts statements would help producers avoid the need to create larger labels 
and thus a larger volume of materials needed.  
 
Having the ability to display this information through a digital solution allows for a more even 
distribution of competition in the marketplace. Industry members can quickly pivot in the digital 
space, providing real time information to the consumer. Label inventory management can be 
better controlled since there wouldn't be a need for obsolescence of labels when there are 
changes to alcohol facts (e.g. a sugar reduction project which may only aﬀect calories and  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025

carbohydrate values). A digital solution also reduces the chances of there being multiple labels 
in market for the same brand as it goes through a reformulation. This, in turn, helps avoid 
consumer confusion when they see labels with diﬀerent values side by side. 
 
Other areas of growing interest to consumers such as sustainability-related information on the 
product or re-use/recycling information can also easily be integrated into digital labels. For 
example, in Italy, mandatory recycling information for glass bottles may be provided in a geo-
localised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels. This is increasingly important even 
domestically, as diﬀerent states adopt environmental or sustainability regulations requiring 
certain label declarations. These eﬃciencies add up to keep the beverage alcohol industry aﬂoat 
and help smaller producers maintain their business amidst ever-changing regulations.   
 
For these reasons, we respectfully request the Bureau allow producers the option of utilizing a 
QR code or website reference to display any nutrient content information mandated by this 
proposal.  
 
2. The Anticipated Costs Associated with This Proposal Will Be Signiﬁcant and Not 
Commensurate with the Beneﬁts 
 
DISCUS and its members greatly appreciate the Bureau’s thorough and detailed cost analysis 
outlined in the NPRM and eﬀorts to keep potential costs down for industry members, 
particularly for smaller participants in the marketplace. TTB’s decision not to require product 
testing and to provide a robust implementation period will go a long way to reducing the 
potential cost burden on producers resulting from this rule. However, the anticipated ﬁnancial 
impact of this rule cannot be overlooked, as it will still be signiﬁcant and potentially unbearable 
for some marketplace participants, especially given the current economic downturn in the 
industry. Flexibility for producers, including the ability to utilize QR codes or website references, 
is critically important and would blunt much of these anticipated ﬁnancial hardships and allow 
for a more reasoned implementation of this proposal.  
 
A. Diﬃcult Moment in the Spirits Industry to Introduce Additional Regulatory Burdens 
 
The distilled spirits sector, and overall beverage alcohol industry, is currently dealing with a 
multitude of headwinds and external constraints, which have resulted in a constricting and 
increasingly diﬃcult marketplace in which to operate. The slowing post-pandemic marketplace 
has hampered U.S. spirits industry revenue, which decreased by $424M in 2024—a 1.1% year 
over year decline
7—and these trends have only continued in 2025. According to the National 
Beverage Alcohol Control Association (NABCA), in control states, spirits dollar sales are down 
1.4% annually in the 12-month period ending in May 2025.

Mexico have also declined 16% in April and 18%9 in May in terms of dollar value compared to 
same month a year ago and, from March through the end of April, sales of U.S. spirits in Canada 
plummeted more than 66%10, highlighting the growing trade-related challenges for the industry.  
 
Operating a craft distillery already comes with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risks—with small margins, 
intense competition, distribution obstacles, challenges building brand equity, rising production 
and materials costs due to inﬂation and tariﬀs, and the daily responsibility of welcoming visitors 
to your distillery and tasting room and keeping your staﬀ paid on time. This economic 
environment has only exacerbated the ﬁnancial constraints on craft distilleries around the 
country. A quick Google search can highlight the sheer number of craft distilleries that have 
closed or ﬁled for bankruptcy over the last several years, as they contend with these broader 
marketplace challenges, which have resulted in craft spirits sales declining by volume and value 
in 2023 for the ﬁrst time.11  
 
Even the larger multinational producers are contending with these economic headwinds by 
downsizing staﬀ, selling oﬀ assets like brands and sites, and even pausing production at 
distilleries around the world. The beverage alcohol industry has been navigating a challenging 
market for the last few years and is being further impacted by ongoing trade disputes. Staﬀ at 
beverage alcohol companies, already dealing with team reductions in many cases, are also 
being tasked with navigating increasingly burdensome regulatory requirements, such as 
extended producer responsibility (EPR) initiatives across a number of states. With the larger 
companies simply trying to keep up with these evolving requirements, smaller producers are at 
a distinct disadvantage as they most likely do not have internal compliance expertise and thus 
need to engage costly outside consultants. 
 
Given these myriad of challenges, it’s not hyperbole to posit that the adoption of this proposal 
with the assumed costs discussed in the NPRM could lead to the closure of even more craft 
distilleries and further attrition throughout the industry. The distilled spirits sector truly cannot 
withstand any additional unplanned regulatory expenditures. 
 
B. Existing Voluntary Commitments Will Not Actively Reduce Potential Relabeling Costs  
 
While TTB mentions that many industry members are already providing nutrient content 
information related to their products, which they argue should reduce overall costs for the 
industry, this information is often being provided through a host of diﬀerent means and formats 
so label redesign will be inevitable for essentially all producers. The NPRM references the 
DISCUS Serving Facts Commitment as one such initiative. The DISCUS Commitment directs

members to provide “Serving Facts” information in either of the currently approved TTB formats 
(either serving facts panel or statement of average analysis) located either on the product label 
or on a company website with an on-label QR code or website reference.  
 
Many DISCUS members elected to include this information via QR code or website reference to 
achieve the eﬃciencies detailed above. While they now have this nutrient content information 
publicly available online, our members would need to redesign their labels to include the 
statement along with the rest of the industry. TTB states in the NPRM that their cost estimate 
model “assumes that 100 percent of brand name products can coordinate a regulatory label 
change with a regularly scheduled label change within two years.”
12  We can say from 
experience that this assumption is false. Even for the DISCUS commitment, members needed at 
least a two-year runway to eﬀectuate the QR code and website revisions, even with many 
companies already having much of the information for the products and a QR code on their 
labels that could be repurposed for this commitment. This NPRM would be a much heavier lift 
to implement and would take substantially longer for companies to eﬀectuate.  
 
Even if the proposed revisions to the Serving Facts label are adopted, such as the title change to 
Alcohol Facts and the mandated ABV and ﬂuid ounce information, those producers with a 
voluntary Serving Facts label on their products will need to redesign every label to 
accommodate this new format. Every beer, wine, and spirits producer will need to incur some 
form of label redesign and printing costs, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of 
nutrient content information.  
 
For a coordinated labeling change (changes that can be coordinated with scheduled changes), 
TTB “estimates the costs per universal product code (UPC) would be $1,636.52 and for an 
uncoordinated distilled spirits labeling change over a ﬁve-year period it would be $10,427.36.”
13 
Even if we accept this cost estimate for a coordinated label change, some of our member 
companies have had thousands of active COLA registrations over the last 20 years and most 
have diverse portfolios of wine, beer, and spirits products that would all need to be relabeled. It 
is clear that this proposal is likely to cost the industry millions of dollars—on the low end—and 
could potentially hamper future innovation or personalization in label design with the prospect 
of increased costs and decreased ﬂexibility. TTB recognizes the potentially severe ﬁnancial 
implications of this proposal when they “estimate the one-time total relabeling costs associated 
with this proposed rule to be approximately $214 million (or $43 million per year) assuming a 
compliance date of 5 years.”
14  
 
The costs estimated by the Bureau most likely fall short of the actual costs of implementing this 
proposal and pose an unreasonable burden on industry members. Allowing ﬂexibility and a 
cost-eﬀective option in QR codes or website references is the only way that distilled spirits

producers across the board can aﬀord to provide nutrient content information to consumers at 
this present time. The beneﬁts of having the nutrient content statements on label as opposed to 
accessible through a QR code are not worth imposing these types of burdensome costs on 
producers attempting to stay aﬂoat and keep their staﬀ employed.  
 
C. Voluntary Testing Costs Should Be Included in TTB’s Cost Estimates   
 
DISCUS agrees that the Bureau should be including the cost of voluntary testing in their cost 
analysis estimates. While testing is thankfully not required in the proposal, industry members 
will likely choose to test some of their products, either initially upon development or routinely 
as batches or formulas change to ensure accurate reporting of the nutrients on label. The 
testing frequency and ultimate cost would vary depending on the size of the company, brand 
portfolio, and characteristics of the particular distilled spirits plant and/or production line.  
 
Most distillers are small businesses and are not familiar with nutrient calculations, and any 
additional compliance burdens can quickly become expensive hurdles for smaller players in the 
industry. For example, many craft distillers may have to hire consultants or companies to handle 
these label/formula elements for their brands, adding costs that they cannot aﬀord in an 
already constricting and diﬃcult marketplace. As we heard from small distillers in the ﬁrst 
comment period on these topics last year, even the act of redesigning and reprinting labels to ﬁt 
this additional information will prove costly, as many do not design these in-house, with some 
distillers in the listening sessions predicting it would cost them thousands of dollars to comply. 
While many craft distillers may utilize calculation methods and databases to prepare their 
nutrient content information, there will be a signiﬁcant proportion of them that will not have 
the time or resources necessary to learn how to integrate these tools and will feel obligated to 
send their products oﬀ to the lab for testing—often, as TTB notes in the NPRM, at several 
hundred dollars per test at many of the preeminent industry labs.  
 
TTB themselves state that “[i]f…industry members will continue to send each product 
formulation for analytical testing each year, the ongoing annualized cost of the proposed rule 
would be approximately $64 million.”
 15 Even spread out over the vast numbers of distillers, 
brewers, vintners, and importers in the United States marketplace, this recurring cost would 
place an unnecessary burden on producers who are simply trying to comply with this regulation 
and ensure their data is accurate.  
 
D. Potential for Signiﬁcant Burdens and Impacts on TTB Staﬀ  
 
When considering new labeling proposals, it is critical to also ensure that any new regulations 
do not overburden TTB staﬀ or create confusion for industry members, consumers, and the 
Bureau alike. While this proposal would thankfully not require the submission of additional  
 
15 90 Fed. Reg. at 6682. Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 11 
 
   
 
certiﬁcates of label approval (COLAs) to facilitate the inclusion of the nutrient content 
statements, the Bureau still has the daunting task of ensuring industry compliance with the rule.  
 
Unfortunately, we understand that the Bureau has undergone signiﬁcant attrition (over 20% 
agency wide) over the course of this year in response to the whole of government staﬀ 
reductions and early retirements, and that TTB is unable to backﬁll any vacancies due to a 
federal hiring freeze until at least October. As a result, TTB staﬀ are being asked to do more with 
less and would have a diﬃcult time implementing and enforcing additional regulatory 
responsibilities under these circumstances. While we would like to think TTB will have their 
staﬃng and budgetary apportionments raised over the next few years, there is no indication 
that this will be the case, and the Bureau should reassess the proposal through this lens. 
 
Even before the staﬀ losses in 2025, TTB, as a whole, had been experiencing signiﬁcant levels of 
attrition over the last several years, including losing roughly 15% of their workforce from 2020-
2022 through a combination of retirements and other departures.
16 This substantial attrition 
has also been seen in the Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD) with the staﬀ tasked 
with conducting these label and formula reviews. Adding increased label or formula 
components will necessitate specialist review and experience and, thus, has the potential to add 
substantial burdens for TTB staﬀ and delays for industry members in the review and approval 
processes. The Bureau has demonstrated considerable positive gains in this area over the last 
decade; delays and label returns have the potential to undo some of this progress, as they have 
signiﬁcant impacts on product timelines and can upend routes to market, seasonal product 
releases, state brand registrations, marketing campaigns, and production schedules. 
 
If mandatory nutrient labeling is implemented, TTB will need to assess how to approach current 
labels in the marketplace and how to ensure industry member compliance with the rules, both 
of which will inevitably lead to complicated implementation and procedural questions. Will TTB 
staﬀ have the bandwidth and technical expertise to assess and review nutrient content 
statements for accuracy? What’s to stop a bad actor from simply including arbitrary numbers on 
their labels? While it’s not cost eﬀective or feasible for TTB to test each product to ensure 
accuracy, there surely must be the need for some oversight and market compliance programs in 
place, which will deplete the Bureau’s budget and staﬀ time. These technical considerations 
could potentially increase burdens on TTB staﬀ and industry members alike and need to be 
thoroughly contemplated during this rulemaking process.  
 
E. This Proposal May Be Inconsistent with Recent Deregulatory Executive Orders 
 
Another consideration the Bureau will need to assess as they prepare a ﬁnal rule is the 
deregulatory priorities of the Trump Administration. In the Trump Administration’s Executive 
Order on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” (January 31, 2025), agencies have been 
 
16 2023 Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Annual Report, pg. 65, available at 
https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/ttbar2023.pdf. Ms. Amy Greenberg

Page 12 
 
   
 
directed to identify at least 10 prior regulations for elimination for each new regulation issued, 
as well as to “ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed 
regulations, being ﬁnalized this year, shall be signiﬁcantly less than zero.”  
 
Given the Bureau’s own extensive and substantial cost estimates included in the NPRM, it 
remains to be seen how this proposal could be ﬁnalized in its current form and comply with the 
directives of this Executive Order. There has been no proposal to eliminate any regulations to 
oﬀset these new proposed regulations, which would need to be carefully evaluated. Further, 
TTB should evaluate any potential unintended consequences of eliminating regulations that 
industry has become accustomed to and supports, as it could lead to other signiﬁcant issues. 
The distilled spirits industry generally supports our regulatory structure, and we have based our 
entire business models around the current set of regulations. Doing away with 50 regulations, 
for example, to implement this proposal could introduce a host of uncertainty and confusion.  
 
We respectfully suggest that oﬀering compliance ﬂexibility to regulated entities will be key to 
achieving that balance. Complicated and costly rules could be diﬃcult for industry members to 
understand and properly comply with. Providing industry members with several avenues to 
comply with the regulations would be useful, given the various label designs, container sizes, 
international markets, and existing commitments that would be impacted by these regulations 
throughout the industry.  
 
3. Standard Drink Metrics Should Be the Preferred Method of Providing Alcohol Information 
 
DISCUS urges the Bureau to maintain its existing position related to the disclosure of ﬂuid 
ounces of alcohol in Serving Facts statements. Listing the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving is 
an optional declaration under Ruling 2013-2 and should remain optional under this new 
scheme. Mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per 
serving by itself on every beverage alcohol product could be confusing for consumers and not 
useful in helping them follow beverage alcohol moderation guidance.  
 
Consumers will be confused how the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol relate to a particular serving of 
alcohol, so a consumer education campaign would be necessary if it were required to appear on 
every label. And, unfortunately, standard labels do not have enough space to clearly articulate 
the signiﬁcance of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. If producers wish to include it voluntarily as part of a 
broader statement, however, along with standard drink information, the option should be 
available to further educate consumers about the particulars of a standard drink.  
 
In lieu of mandatory information related to the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving, DISCUS 
supports the inclusion of standard drink information, either through text or the use of an icon, 
as part of any Alcohol or Serving Facts statement. Consumers have far more familiarity with 
standard drink terminology than with the calculation of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. And the  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 13 
 
   
 
inclusion of standard drinks along with a recommended serving size will communicate 
information that facilitates responsibility, in a manner that is consistent with general consumer 
understanding. 
 
Since 1985, information about standard drinks has been a key part of the Dietary Guidelines for 
American’s guidance on moderate consumption. Government experts and public health 
organizations – in the U.S. and worldwide – have long recognized the importance of providing 
standard drink information. The Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, in 
consultation with health experts around the nation, consistently have deﬁned a standard drink 
in the various editions of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as containing 0.6 ﬂ. oz. (14 
grams) of alcohol. Also provided in the Dietary Guidelines are examples of standard drink 
equivalents, such as 12 ﬂ. oz. of 5% ABV regular beer, 5 ﬂ. oz. of 12% ABV wine or 1.5 ﬂ. oz. of 
40% ABV (80 proof) distilled spirits. 
 
Consumers have become accustomed to framing their responsible consumption practices 
around these drink measurements. DISCUS believes inclusion of standard drink information in 
relation to serving size nutrient content information will be a beneﬁcial tool for consumers and 
suggests that an icon might be the most eﬀective way to communicate this, whether it is 
through a QR code scan or on label. An example of icons that TTB could look to emulate are 
those currently in use in the Australian market:  
 
 
These icons clearly communicate to the consumer the approximate number of standard drinks 
present in each package. We believe this might be the most eﬃcient and consumer friendly 
method to display alcohol per serving information, and TTB should explore mandating a 
standard drink icon if they seek to ﬁnalize this proposal.  
 
In the NPRM, TTB also queries whether labels should include a summary of the Dietary 
Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking that would be updated based on any changes in the 
guidelines over time. Although we support consumer education when it comes to moderate 
alcohol consumption, DISCUS does not support including moderate drinking guidance from the 
Dietary Guidelines on spirits labels, given that this information would take up additional label 
space and can change with the issuance of each new edition. The standard drink information or 
icon suﬃciently provides responsible consumption information. And, if information can be 
provided via a QR code, the landing page would have space to provide information on the 
Dietary Guidelines and can include a link to the Guidelines, themselves.

4. TTB’s Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts in the Nutrient Content Statements Will 
Create Consumer Confusion, Damage Brand Equity, and Impede Innovation 
 
We respectfully submit that TTB's proposed approach to ""serving sizes"" as a basis for the 
Nutrient Content Statement is ﬂawed: mandating proposed serving sizes (based on Ruling 
2013-2) for many current and future products would be confusing to the consumer and 
damaging to brands, as it is contrary to how it is intended to be enjoyed. It will also impede 
innovation based on consumer trends, such as the current trend to provide lower ABV options. 
TTB’s proposed serving sizes seem to be centered around the assumption that the only means 
of drinking a wine, beer, or spirits product is straight, unmixed with other beverages. While this 
may be mostly true for wine and beer products, it most certainly is not the case for distilled 
spirits products, which often serve as “ingredients” in a wide-range of cocktails. Accordingly, it is 
imperative that producers have more ﬂexibility in deﬁning the serving size for each product.  
 
The terminology “serving size” communicates to the consumer that this is the recommended 
serving that they should be consuming. TTB states that these serving size reference amounts are 
intended “only as a basis for the consumer to determine alcohol, calorie, and nutrient intake 
and not as a recommended consumption amount.”
17  Most consumers will not understand this 
distinction and will rightly assume that the serving size listed on the bottle refers to the 
recommended amount that the consumer should pour into a serving. If the stated serving size is 
5 oz., the consumer will believe that a normal serving for that product is 5 oz. This could be 
misleading and damaging to the brand equity for these brands and inadvertently lead to the 
consumption of more alcohol. A few examples of this confusion and damage to brand equity are 
outlined below.  
 
First, there are many liqueurs, cordials, and specialty products currently on the market that 
producers recommend be enjoyed in a 2oz pour (sometimes as part of a cocktail), but would fall 
into a 5 oz. required serving size in the current proposal. Recommending a 5 oz. pour would 
make the experience less enjoyable and may turn a consumer oﬀ from the product altogether. It 
would also increase the recommended amount of alcohol and calories, which is not the desire 
of producers or consumers, and we do not believe is the goal of the present rulemaking. The 
stated ABV cutoﬀs simply do not align with traditional serving sizes or how the manufacturer 
would recommend that many products are consumed.

.37

Page 15 
 
   
 
Second, there is also a growing trend to oﬀer lower ABV versions of popular products. If there is 
a rigid serving size requirement based on ABV, there could be an unintended consequence of 
forcing a lower ABV product into the 5 oz. serving size which could have a greater amount of 
alcohol than the original full proof product with a serving size of 1.5 oz. See the example below, 
whereby the current requirements would have the unintended consequence of recommending 
a serving size for the lower ABV version that has 25% more alcohol than the serving size for the 
regular full-strength product.  
 
Product Serving Size Standard Drink (Per USDG) 
Full proof product – 40%

ABV 
5 oz. Serving Size (per 
proposal) 
1.25 
 1.5 oz. Serving Size (per 
producer recommended 
serving) 
0.38  
 
There has been growing interest in lower ABV alternatives to consumers’ favorite products and 
mandating this rigid serving size protocol will certainly chill innovation in that space and no 
doubt other future areas of consumer choice that have yet to materialize.  
 
Third, the proposed serving sizes will create confusion in the increasingly popular Ready-to-
Drink (RTD) space, as there are a variety of ABVs and intended serving suggestions. For example, 
two nearly identical products – one at 7% ABV and one at 8% ABV – that are intended to be 
enjoyed in a similar fashion could result in a very diﬀerent suggested serving, with impacts to 
the suggested alcohol and caloric intake.

Instead of mandating the 2013-2 serving sizes, we urge the Bureau to oﬀer producers the option 
to recommend the appropriate serving size for the product and not be forced to display serving 
sizes that may not ﬁt every type of product. This option is complementary to our suggested 
inclusion of standard drink information, which would clearly communicate the serving size as it 
is intended to be enjoyed, as well as the amount of alcohol in that serving in the context of the 
standard drink (which as discussed above, will be easier for consumers to understand).  
 
Speciﬁc Comments on Other Aspects of the Proposal 
 
Questions/Issues: 
 
I. Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement  
 
With regards to the proposal to amend the title of the beverage alcohol information statement, 
we do not see a reason to alter the existing “Serving Facts” terminology and merge these 
statements under the “Alcohol Facts” moniker.  
 
Consumers readily understand the terminology of “Serving Facts” and have been encountering 
these statements on beverage alcohol products for over a decade now. Altering the title of 
these statements now could lead to consumer confusion, especially considering that the title of 
“Serving Facts” better describes the nature of the information being presented to the consumer 
and that most producers, if looking to include additional consumer information on label, have 
opted to utilize the Serving Facts statement over the existing Alcohol Facts statement.   
 
As such, our members have indicated that a mandated change in the terminology to “Alcohol 
Facts” would increase compliance costs for products already containing a “Serving Facts” panel, 
as every label with a voluntarily ""Serving Facts"" statement would need to be revised. They 
would incur ﬁnancial impacts for creating new print plates, printing new labels, and writing oﬀ 
costs for ""Serving Facts"" labels that could no longer be used. One member indicated that this 
change would aﬀect over 1,000 labels in their portfolio that would need to be revised from 
""Serving Facts"" to ""Alcohol Facts."" 
 
Switching the terminology to “Alcohol Facts” would obscure the main purpose of providing this 
information to the consumer, which is to share the nutrient content information related to a 
serving of the product. We urge TTB to maintain the longstanding “Serving Facts” terminology. 
 
II. Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information 
 
A. A Host of Nutrient Content Information is Currently Available to Consumers  
 
As we detail in our submission last year, many spirits producers currently voluntarily provide 
nutrient information to consumers. In 2022, DISCUS Members committed to provide consumers Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 17 
 
   
 
with nutrient content information, such as serving size, number of calories and grams of carbs, 
protein, and fat per serving size, through either of the currently TTB-approved formats (Serving 
Facts panel or statement of average analysis) on new labels by June 2024.18 This information is 
now available for all spirits products distributed in the United States by DISCUS Director 
Members, either displayed directly on the label or via a URL or scannable QR code on the label.  
 
The majority of multi-national producers also provide nutrient content information on their 
brand and corporate websites to satisfy voluntary commitments made in other markets, such as 
in Europe, as well as on some e-commerce platforms at the point of purchase.  
 
Beyond what distillers provide directly, many governmental and private websites also provide 
serving fact information for categories of standards of identity, which generally do not vary 
dramatically across brand given the strict requirements on production, ingredients, and alcohol 
content. For example, the USDA FoodData Central database includes information for general 
categories of beverage alcohol. The page for “Alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof” 
provides that 1 ﬂ. oz. contains 64.2 kcals.
19 As with most spirits products, the value for most of 
the other nutrients for that product, including protein, fat, and carbs, is zero.   
 
B. Harmonizing Nutrient Labeling Requirements with FDA Would Be Inappropriate and 
Overly Burdensome 
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks for the industry’s views on whether they should seek greater 
harmonization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on nutrient content statements 
and if TTB should adopt FDA’s Nutrition Facts panel. DISCUS strongly supports TTB’s 
longstanding jurisdiction over beverage alcohol labeling and the Bureau’s approach to nutrient 
content labeling and opposes adoption of the FDA’s nutrition labeling scheme.  
 
We believe that the many diﬀerences between distilled spirits and other non-alcohol beverages 
make it unnecessary and even misleading to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on 
food labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction. One major concern is that listing the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients on an alcoholic beverage label could 
mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on beverage alcohol consumption to satisfy 
part of their daily nutrient requirements. There is no daily recommendation/Dietary Reference  
  
 
18 DISCUS Director Members announced this voluntary commitment to provide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products 
as part of the 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. The commitment by DISCUS Director Members to 
provide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products empowers consumers to make healthy choices and foster environments 
that enable people to make informed decisions. This commitment did not extend to DISCUS Craft Members, who may not have 
as many resources to dedicate to calculate and conform this information to TTB required speciﬁcations. It also does not extend 
to limited-run test products available on-site at production facilities and tasting rooms.

Intake for alcohol. Distilled spirits producers would not in any way want to make that implication 
on our brand labels and strongly oppose the inclusion of daily values on TTB-regulated 
products.  
 
On this point, it’s important to note that no other country requires daily value information for 
listed nutrients on distilled spirits labels, so this would be a departure from common global 
practices. Over the past ﬁve years, our members indicated they have not received any consumer 
inquires for many of these nutrients, such as fat (including saturated fat and trans-fat), sodium, 
protein, and cholesterol. This experience demonstrates that this information is not relevant to 
beverage alcohol products or consumers and should not be required to be listed on labels. 
 
DISCUS also opposes mandated inclusion of any additional components that the FDA may 
require, like sodium, as they would not provide any value to the consumer given their typically 
low or non-existent levels in beverage alcohol products.  
 
The adoption of FDA nutrition facts labels on TTB-regulated products would also impose 
signiﬁcant costs and burdens on industry members as it would require extensive testing and a 
complete overhaul of existing labels, whereas the proposed statements could be implemented 
with less disruption to label portfolios. Requiring a full FDA nutrition facts table would take up 
even more space on already limited labels and hamper competition throughout the industry. 
 
Additionally, unlike most food and beverage products, spirits undergo a rigorous pre-approval 
process at TTB for their labels and formulas to ensure compliance with the Bureau’s rules and 
regulations. This pre-approval process is unique in relation to products by the FDA, where there 
is no pre-approval process before products can enter the marketplace. Beverage alcohol 
products under the FDA’s purview contain the full FDA nutrition and ingredients label, but they 
are not required to go through the same pre-approval process as those regulated by TTB and 
are only subject to post-market sampling enforcement eﬀorts to ensure product compliance and 
safety.  
 
As part of its pre-approval process, TTB reviews every proposed label submission for all distilled 
spirits products, with a particular focus on whether the product meets its identiﬁed class/type 
and does not mislead consumers about the nature of the product. Through this review, TTB also 
essentially signals that spirits labels in the marketplace contain accurate and understandable 
information that consumers can rely on to make their purchasing decisions.  
 
The mandate of any additional information—either through TTB’s proposed statement or an 
FDA nutrition facts label—will inevitably be complicated by the pre-approval process and should 
be carefully evaluated through that lens. In particular, there will be acute complications if 
information is required to be presented on the label (rather than via scannable QR code or URL)  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025

and if the longstanding acceptable practice of providing ingredient ranges for formulas is 
disallowed or compromised through the adoption of an FDA-like system of labeling ingredients 
in order of predominance.  
 
Reasonable timelines for formula and label approvals are key to manage industry member 
production, marketing, and state registration requirements. Additional delays or complications 
in this process could cause undue ﬁnancial hardships for industry members—hardships that 
other food and beverage products do not face in the FDA process with no prior approval. Testing 
for nutrients, particularly if an FDA nutrition facts label was required, would be cost prohibitive 
for the majority of industry members and would create signiﬁcant burdens on their operations. 
This is particularly true for innovators that release several new brands or limited releases each 
year. Formula ranges have been allowed for decades and shifting this policy now would create 
havoc for every industry member who has a formula currently approved with the TTB, as these 
would need to be revisited and altered.  
 
C. Sugar Content Statements Should Remain Optional 
 
In its NPRM, TTB proposed to allow optional sugar content statements as part of the Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statement. DISCUS supports the optional inclusion of sugar content statements, 
consistent with the current approach, and agree with its inclusion in the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement if provided.  
 
D. Inclusion of Micronutrients Should Remain Optional 
 
DISCUS strongly suggests that micronutrients should remain an optional inclusion. In most 
instances, micronutrient values would be zero and would not provide consumer beneﬁt to being 
included in the Alcohol Facts statement but might cause consumer confusion.  
 
E. Spirits Products Should Have the Ability to List Only Nutrients Present in the Product 
 
We can appreciate the Bureau’s response to our previous comment on this topic in the NPRM 
that “[w]hile certain alcohol beverages are unlikely to contain certain nutrients, such as fat or 
protein, even the absence of these components provides information and may be of interest to 
consumers.”
20 While some consumers certainly may be interested in seeing the absence of 
those components on the label, we believe the vast majority of consumers are well aware that 
whiskey or vodka products, for example, do not contain any fat or protein. These nutrients are 
not commonly associated with distilled spirits products, unless they contain cream or other 
such ingredients. Allowing the listing of calories alone on label for products without any other 
nutrients would also align the U.S. with the EU marketplace, creating additional eﬃciencies for 
exporters.  
 
 
20 90 Fed. Reg. at 6665. Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 20 
 
   
 
At a minimum, TTB should consider allowing producers to employ a short-hand version of the 
statement for products containing only calories that identiﬁes the absence of other nutrients, 
without having to print the entire statement with only zeros. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein 
should only be required to be included on label to the extent they are actually present in the 
product at certain levels. 
 
F. Vitamin or Mineral Statements Should Be Prohibited 
 
The distilled spirits industry strongly opposes the inclusion of vitamin or mineral statements on 
labels. We believe that including numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of 
alcohol beverages could create an erroneous impression to consumers that the consumption of 
beverage alcohol has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts, or is part of their daily 
dietary needs. We know TTB strictly enforces potential health claims under the current 
regulations and allowing vitamin or mineral statements will only lead to increased confusion 
around health claims for both consumers and the Bureau. As such, we strongly recommend 
against including such a numerical statement.  
 
III. Calculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels 
 
In this NPRM, TTB proposes modifying the tolerance levels outlined in TTB Procedure 2020-1 by 
eliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice 
limitations"" and shifting to an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20% either above 
or below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. DISCUS supports this 
proposal.  
 
The proposed 20% above or below the labeled amount is reasonable and broad enough to 
facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating 
calorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to 
consumers. Further clariﬁcation would be welcomed, however, on how the tolerance might 
apply for products making speciﬁc calorie claims (e.g. ""only 100 calories.”) 
 
The ability to continue to rely on databases and this updated tolerance will be critical for 
industry compliance with this proposal. Relying on databases and calculators allows industry 
members to provide nutrient content information without conducting costly and burdensome 
laboratory testing on each of their products, particularly for brand extensions that might have 
variation in ABV from bottle to bottle, such as bottled-in-bond or barrel strength whiskies. TTB’s 
continued recognition that databases and calculation methods can accurately determine 
nutrient content information is appreciated and will help lessen burdens associated with this 
proposal and increase eﬃciencies with international markets.

IV. Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on all Alcohol Beverage Products  
 
While we do not support mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl 
alcohol per serving by itself on every beverage alcohol product, we fully support and applaud 
the Bureau's proposal to require the disclosure of the alcohol content, expressed as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), for all beverage alcohol products both under its 
jurisdiction and FDA’s. By this action, TTB will ﬁnally require all regulated alcohol products to 
bear an alcohol content statement, which has long been required for all distilled spirits 
products. There’s no rationale to exempt certain beverage alcohol products from declaring their 
alcohol content on label while others are required to do so and the Bureau’s action will ensure 
consumers can be increasingly aware of the alcohol content of their alcohol beverage of choice.  
 
Importantly, TTB also proposed to mandate alcohol content labeling on non-alcohol beverage 
products, which DISCUS greatly supports. As the non-alcohol beverage space continues to 
become more popular, industry would welcome guidance on labeling requirements since many 
of these products may straddle TTB and FDA labeling requirements. Ambiguity in this category 
and proper regulatory authority has resulted in inconsistent labeling practices across the 
marketplace. 
 
V. Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement 
 
As raised by the Bureau in the NPRM, we respectfully request that the alcohol content 
statement not be mandated as part of an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement and that the 
alcohol by volume statement on the brand label remain the primary alcohol content statement 
required. Distilled spirits consumers are accustomed to interacting with ABV information in the 
same ﬁeld of vision as other mandatory information on the front of most distilled spirits bottles, 
so moving the required statement onto an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement could lead to 
consumer confusion or inconvenience. If this change was adopted, consumers will not, in most 
cases, readily be able to see the ABV statement while perusing product at a retail location as 
they will need to turn container to look for the ABV disclosure in the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement.  
 
Given that this would be an enormous departure from how distilled spirits labels have 
historically been organized, TTB does not provide suﬃcient rationale in the NPRM for why the 
Alcohol or Serving Facts statement is the appropriate mandatory location for this information or 
why a currently optional declaration under the voluntary scheme outlined by TTB Ruling 2013-2 
is now becoming required. Current Serving Facts panels under the voluntary scheme are only 
required to list serving size, servings per container, calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  
 
If information related to serving size and the number of standard drinks per serving are included 
in the Alcohol or Serving Facts panel, this information is adequate, in terms of what a consumer 
needs to help inform their responsible consumption. If the ABV is already stated in another Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 22 
 
   
 
location on the product, the producer should have the option and ﬂexibility to include it in an 
Alcohol or Serving Facts statement if they choose to do so. Producers wanting to maintain their 
current label design and placement of the ABV on the front of the label should not be burdened 
with displaying the same information twice on their label in order for it to be compliant with 
this new scheme.  
 
VI. Linear Display and Type Size of Alcohol Facts Information  
 
A. Proposed Linear Display Increases Flexibility and Should Not Require a Box 
 
DISCUS appreciates the inclusion of a linear display option for the Alcohol or Serving Facts 
statement, as this will increase the ﬂexibility for industry members in how they choose to 
display the mandated information based upon their speciﬁc label characteristics and available 
space. There is no reason to believe that the linear display option would be diﬃcult for 
consumers to understand or locate on label, as TTB has essentially permitted a similar 
statement for over 20 years. Consumers have become accustomed to engaging with statements 
of average analysis since the Bureau approved them in 2004 and, while they do not include all 
of the information outlined in this proposal, they do provide all of the nutrient content 
information included in the Serving Facts format, without a box surrounding the statement. 
Given the similarities between this linear display and statements of average analysis, consumers 
should be able to easily locate and understand this information.  
 
DISCUS urges the Bureau to revise the proposal to make the box around both the linear and 
panel display Alcohol Facts statements optional. Given the amount of information being 
provided in the statement, consumers will have no trouble locating these statements on the 
label. The box is another element that adds complexity to designing labeling that meets all 
mandatory requirements with limited space availability. The Bureau allows this ﬂexibility now, 
as many Serving Facts statements are provided on label without a box around them, and they 
are just as recognizable for consumers. TTB also pre-approves every label and will retain the 
option to send a COLA back for correction if a specialist felt a producer was trying to obscure or 
hide an Alcohol Facts statement. Industry members should be given maximum ﬂexibility to 
decide how to best implement this proposal for their products - whether with a linear or panel 
display, as well as where it is located on label.  
 
B. Formatting and Type Size Requirements 
 
DISCUS agrees with TTB’s proposal that, if required on label, the type size for an Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statement should be consistent with the existing mandatory disclosures. While 
pertaining to beer and wine products only, DISCUS also supports the elimination of the 
maximum type size limitation. 
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 23 
 
   
 
C. Cost Estimates for Linear Display  
 
While we discuss the anticipated cost of this proposal in depth above, we would like to stress 
that, even with a linear display allowance, each label will need to be reviewed and readjusted to 
ﬁt this additional information. For those labels that are space constrained, dielines would have 
to increase for the inclusion of the Alcohol Facts statement, which could have a detrimental 
environmental and sustainability impact. Every statement option aside from a QR code would 
pose a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden to update all product labels to include Alcohol Facts 
statements. Among the on-pack options, the linear display format will impose the least burdens 
for industry members because it takes up much less space, in what is already a limited area for 
many of our products. This ﬁnancial impact would also decrease if the box around the linear 
and panel displays was made optional, as producers could then ﬁt the required information into 
even more space on the label.  
 
VII. Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display 
 
DISCUS agrees that the dual-column alcohol facts panels should remain optional. We also agree 
with TTB’s proposal to allow the dual-column format on alcohol beverages sold in containers 
holding at least 200 percent and less than 500 percent of the serving size reference amount, as 
this would more accurately reﬂect the way in which alcohol beverages are bottled and labeled 
and how producers might want to utilize these panels. 
 
Education may be needed, however, around the meaning of dual-column labels for the 
consumer to correctly read and understand dual-column labels and to understand how the 
manufacturer is intending the consumer to approach the servings shown. It’s possible that dual-
column displays could create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol 
beverage at once or in one sitting is expected or recommended. In other regions, such as the 
EU, most companies only provide nutrient content facts per 100mL measurements. With so 
many diﬀerent serving sizes and container sizes in the US, it would be practically very diﬃcult 
for companies to implement a dual-column display for every bottle size and SKU.  
 
In addition, if TTB does not allow Alcohol or Serving Facts statements to be provided by QR 
codes, the amount of space required to print dual-column panels information can impact 
already limited label space availability, so allowing producers the option of including a dual-
column display at their discretion rather than requiring it provides essential ﬂexibility.  
 
VIII. Implementation Period 
 
Thousands of brands will be aﬀected by this initiative, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the global commerce in beverage alcohol products and the multitude of products that 
are imported into the United States, DISCUS appreciates the ﬁve-year phase-in period included Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 24 
 
   
 
in the proposal and believes that this implementation timeframe should be suﬃcient to 
eﬀectuate the necessary labeling and branding changes. 
 
This length of time will be essential to address label development and redesign, along with the 
associated resources and outside expertise required in a label initiative aﬀecting the industry. 
DISCUS appreciates the Bureau not requiring resubmission of COLAs to include Alcohol or 
Serving Facts statements, as this would greatly increase burdens throughout the industry and 
for the Bureau’s ALFD staﬀ by creating a tidal wave of applications. A ﬁve-year phase-in 
timetable for compliance provides a more orderly transition period across a company's brand 
portfolio - be it a large, medium or small portfolio and/or with ""fast moving"" or ""slow moving"" 
brands. This timeframe would allow companies to transition to new labeling requirements in a 
structured manner, which would beneﬁt all stakeholders. 
 
Even with this ﬁve-year implementation period, exceptions would need to be considered for 
legacy products or products that have aged in bottle (e.g., ice wine, etc.). A waiver or other 
mechanic should be in place to help protect investments that may not comply. Further 
clariﬁcation is also needed regarding the exact mechanics of the ultimate compliance date and 
which products it could impact that are already in the marketplace. Would it only be applicable 
to new products produced after the ﬁnal rule goes into eﬀect? What about inventory sitting 
either in a warehouse or on a store shelf? Would existing inventory need to be reworked to 
comply with the ﬁnal rule? These important questions demonstrate the realities producers will 
need to contend with if this proposal is ﬁnalized, as well as the type of questions the Bureau 
should be prepared to respond to either in the rule language itself or an accompanying FAQ 
guidance document.  
 
In the NPRM, the Bureau asked how frequently labels are changed on beverage alcohol 
products, and the answer truly diﬀers based on producer and brand. Each brand is unique in 
the frequency that labels are changed. While not always the case, generally speaking, straight 
spirits brands change product labels less frequently than formulated products or certain 
categories like ready-to-drink (RTDs). A shorter amount of time to comply than the proposed 
ﬁve years isn't realistic given the uniqueness of each label. Each label size will need to be 
analyzed and possibly reworked to provide enough space for the inclusion of an Alcohol Facts 
statement. Labels may have to increase their dieline to meet the requirements, which from an 
environmental and sustainability practice introduces additional burden to the industry.  
 
Companies that choose to comply earlier obviously would be free to do so and, if QR code 
transmission was permitted, we believe you would see a host of companies able to comply in 
very quick order given the ease of updating or changing information hosted on those webpages. 
If required on label, however, some of our members indicated that they would opt to begin to 
include the required information as a brand goes through a redesign or is being updated. This 
would reduce the amount of times a label has to be touched, thus helping to reduce the cost 
associated with updating a label, but would result in a slower roll-out than if there was more Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 25 
 
   
 
ﬂexibility. Our members relayed that they would need to begin taking steps towards the 
implementation of the labeling changes right away in order to become compliant before the 
compliance period begins in ﬁve years. 
  
We also urge the Bureau to synchronize the implementation of any mandatory labeling changes 
so that industry members are able to comply with these new requirements in the most eﬃcient 
manner. This would include not only the mandatory allergen labeling requirements, but also 
any ingredient labeling proposal the Bureau might be considering.  
 
While we understand that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking related to ingredient 
labeling was withdrawn earlier this year prior to its release, if the Bureau intends to revive it in 
another form, it’s critical to note that any eventual ingredient labeling requirements being on a 
diﬀerent implementation track would be ﬁnancially and logistically devasting for industry 
members large and small. It would be unreasonable to ask industry members to undergo costly 
label redesign to include nutrient content and allergen information and begin production on 
those new labels across all their product lines, only to be notiﬁed they will need to restart label 
redesign to incorporate ingredient information in a couple years. We respectfully request that 
TTB consider this important point as they seek to ﬁnalize these pending rulemakings and 
prepare their future regulatory agenda.  
 
Conclusion and Summary 
 
DISCUS supports TTB’s objective to provide consumers with clear, consistent information about 
alcohol. It is critical that the ﬁnal rule serves the public's interests, without placing undue 
burden on distillers, overwhelming agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confusing consumers. We 
believe this proposal, if adopted as-is, would not meet these objectives, and we urge TTB to 
reconsider certain aspects.  
 
We request greater ﬂexibility in terms of how and where the Alcohol Facts information is 
provided. Most critically, we propose the option to include it via QR codes or links. This 
approach: 
• Ensures broad consumer access (e.g., QR codes/links in advertising) and readability (e.g., 
multiple languages for non-English speakers);  
• Oﬀers the ability to provide consumers with up-to-date, detailed information, while 
accounts for small product/label space limitations;  
• Reduces burden on producers, especially craft distillers, who are already facing 
economic headwinds; 
• Allows producers to be nimble in responding to labeling changes and/or geographical 
diﬀerences (e.g., bottle return) and, thus, minimizes waste; and 
• Aligns with labeling in other regions of the world, including the EU, which results in 
greater consistency and can reduce potential trade barriers. 
 Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 26 
 
   
 
DISCUS recommends that Alcohol Facts information specify the number of standard drinks 
per container – potentially via a graphic alongside text that states the number of servings. The 
inclusion of standard drink information better aligns with consumer understanding than the 
proposed requirement to list the amount of pure alcohol in grams, which could result in 
consumer confusion. 
 
DISCUS has concerns regarding the signiﬁcant anticipated costs associated with this proposal, 
which are not commensurate with the stated beneﬁts. TTB’s own cost estimates anticipate 
implementing this Alcohol Facts proposal will cost producers millions of dollars in label redesign, 
marketing, logistics, and printing expenditures, at a time when the industry is constricting and 
unable to absorb these unbudgeted costs. Allowing for ﬂexibility in transmission of this 
information will enable broad industry compliance.   
 
DISCUS believes TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts for the nutrient content 
statements will create consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. 
The Ruling 2013-2 serving sizes do not appropriately ﬁt with consumer understanding around 
traditional pours for many products and misrepresent serving sizes for many liqueurs and lower 
ABV products. Allowing ﬂexibility for producers to provide their recommended serving size 
when a prescribed one does not neatly ﬁt is required if this proposal were to be adopted.   
 
* * * * * 
 
America’s distillers and marketers of spirits want to ensure that consumers have access to the 
information they need, but this proposal leaves several important issues unaddressed and 
opens distillers up to potential costs that might be insurmountable in the current market. We 
implore TTB to carefully evaluate all potential implications of this proposal to avoid undue 
burden on distillers and TTB staﬀ, as well as any inadvertent consumer confusion. We believe 
ﬂexibility and clarity will be the key to ﬁnding a balanced approach.   
 
Thank you again for providing an opportunity to discuss this important topic and we look 
forward to liaising with the Bureau on these matters going forward. If you have any questions 
regarding our submission, please do not hesitate to reach out.

 RE:   ACSA’s  Comments  on  Notice  No.  237  Alcohol  Facts  Statement  in  the  Labeling  
of
 
Wine,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages
 
 
[Submitted  electronically  on  https://www.regulations.gov]  
 
Introduction  
This  is  a  challenging  time  for  U.S.  small  businesses,  and  distilleries  are  no  exception.  While  new  
distilled
 
spirits
 
plants
 
(DSPs)
 
continue
 
to
 
open
 
across
 
the
 
country,
 
many
 
others
 
are
 
closing,
 
and
 
those
 
that
 
remain
 
are
 
struggling
 
to
 
stay
 
afloat.
 
In
 
light
 
of
 
this,
 
ACSA
 
is
 
disappointed
 
that,
 
in
 
evaluating
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
proposed
 
regulations
 
on
 
small
 
business,
 
TTB
 
does
 
not
 
propose
 
different
 
rulemakings
 
for
 
small
 
businesses
 
to
 
ease
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
their
 
operations.
  
TTB’s
 
primary
 
rulemakings
 
include
 
none
 
that
 
ease
 
the
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
producers.
 
Instead,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
proposal
 
would
 
disproportionately
 
harm
 
our
 
small
 
business
 
manufacturers
 
without
 
delivering
 
any
 
meaningful
 
public
 
benefit
 
to
 
offset
 
the
 
damage.
 
1  
 
If  TTB  does  proceed  with  an  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  rule,  it  should  exempt  small  DSPs.  ACSA  
strongly
 
urges
 
TTB
 
to
 
reexamine
 
its
 
typical
 
policy
 
of
 
promulgating
 
uniform
 
regulations
 
for
 
entities
 
of
 
all
 
sizes.
 
 
Additionally,  TTB’s  proposed  rules  get  consumer  information  and  public  health  needs  
backwards.
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
consumer
 
information
 
on
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
label
 
is
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
In
 
labeling
 
and
 
graphic
 
design,
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
info
 
gets
 
the
 
most
 
square
 
inches.
 
Yet
 
TTB’s
 
own
 
proposed
 
panels
 
in
 
this
 
rulemaking
 
take
 
up
 
over
 
50
 
times
 
the
 
surface
 
area
 
of
 
a
 
compliant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
while
 
potentially
 
only
 
adding
 
calorie
 
information
 
that
 
few
 
consumers
 
need
 
or
 
want.
 
Only
 
4%
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
report
 
that
 
consumers
 
have
 
requested
 
nutritional
 
information.
 
However,  ACSA  is  not  opposed  to  TTB’s  proposal  to  require  allergen  labeling.  Unlike  the  
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
labeling
 
rule,
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
serves
 
a
 
compelling
 
consumer
 
and
 
public
 
health
 
need
 
while
 
adding
 
minimal
 
burden
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
We  recognize  that  consumers  need  to  be  informed  about  the  risk  of  consuming  an  ingredient  
that
 
might
 
cause
 
a
 
dangerous
 
allergic
 
reaction.
 
Unlike
 
calorie
 
counts
 
in
 
non-nutritive
 
products,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
life-or-death
 
information
 
for
 
certain
 
consumers.
 
 
As  for  the  burden,  allergen  information  costs  us  nothing  to  obtain  as  we  know  what  goes  in  our  
products.
 
It
 
would
 
take
 
up
 
very
 
little
 
label
 
space,
 
limiting
 
graphic
 
design
 
and
 
printing
 
costs.
 
And
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
exemptions
 
would
 
mean
 
most
 
products
 
wouldn’t
 
need
 
to
 
include
 
any
 
new
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
labels
 
at
 
all.
 
Exempt  Small  DSPs  from  Additional  Labeling  
Requirements.
 
TTB  states  that  this  initiative  emerged  from  the  Competitiveness  Executive  Order  that  was  
intended
 
to
 
help
 
small
 
businesses
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry.
 
Yet
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM,
 
TTB
 
proposes
 
to
 
follow
 
almost
 
all
 
FDA
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
EXCEPT
 
those
 
exempting
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
ACSA  strongly  urges  TTB  to  reconsider  this  position.   
We  propose  that  TTB  consider  those  DSPs  that  removed  fewer  than  100,000  taxable  proof  
gallons
 
from
 
bond
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
calendar
 
year,
 
and
 
that
 
reasonably
 
expect
 
to
 
remove
 
fewer
 
than
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallon
 
bonds
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
calendar
 
year,
 
to
 
be
 
small
 
producers
 
for
 
the
 
purposes
 
of
 
these
 
rules.
 
This
 
threshold
 
is
 
in
 
keeping
 
with
 
the
 
intent
 
of
 
Congress’
 
having
 
set
 
that
 
threshold
 
for
 
reduced
 
excise
 
tax
 
payment
 
in
 
the
 
Craft
 
Beverage
 
Modernization
 
Act,
 
and
 
just
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
CBMTRA,
 
distillers
 
should
 
be
 
independent
 
of
 
control
 
groups
 
removing
 
more
 
than
 
that
 
proof
 
gallon
 
threshold.
 
 
According  to  TTB’s  data,  a  100,000  proof  gallon  threshold  for  new  labeling  requirements  would  
remove
 
burdens
 
from
 
small
 
businesses
 
while
 
providing
 
nutritional
 
information
 
on
 
97%
 
of
 
spirits
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
2   
Precedent  for  Exempting  Small  Businesses  From  Nutrition  Info  
Labeling
 
TTB  and  its  predecessor  ATF  have  followed  FDA’s  lead  on  nutritional  information  labeling  for  
decades,
 
and
 
this
 
NPRM
 
proposes
 
to
 
continue
 
and
 
expand
 
that
 
practice.
 
FDA
 
is
 
the
 
nation’s
 
leading
 
authority
 
on
 
nutrition
 
labeling.
 
TTB’s
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
NRPM
 
invokes
 
FDA’s
 
name
 
91
 
times.
 
TTB
 
is
 
considering
 
how
 
closely
 
its
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
requirements
 
and
 
graphic
 
design
 
should
 
mirror
 
FDA’s
 
Nutrition
 
Facts
 
labels.
 
What’s
 
more,
 
TTB
 
proposes
 
to
 
peg
 
numerous
 
nutritional
 
information
 
rules
 
to
 
FDA’s,
 
including
 
the
 
tolerance
 
for
 
calorie
 
labeling
 
accuracy
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
round
 
calories
 
to
 
the
 
nearest
 
multiple
 
of
 
ten.
 
 
As  TTB  notes  in  this  NPRM,  FDA  exempts  small  businesses  from  its  nutritional  information  
labeling
 
and
 
restaurant
 
menu
 
nutritional
 
information
 
posting
 
requirements.
 
As  TTB  well  knows,  FDA  is  responsible  for  labeling  regulations  for  certain  alcoholic  beverages,  
such
 
as
 
cider
 
with
 
under
 
7%
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume.
 
In
 
general,
 
these
 
ciders
 
must
 
follow
 
FDA’s
 
ingredient
 
and
 
nutrition
 
labeling
 
rules.
 
But
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions,
 
small
 
cider
 
producers
 
are
 
exempt.
 
See
 
the
 
below
 
slide
 
from
 
TTB’s
 
presentation
 
at
 
CiderCon
 
2023,
 
and
 
its
 
footnote
 
pointing
 
out
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions:
 
Given  that  an  entire  alcoholic  beverage  category  has  been  on  the  market  for  years  with  a  
two-tiered
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
regulation
 
that
 
exempts
 
small
 
businesses,
 
ACSA
 
encourages
 
TTB
 
to
 
consult
 
with
 
FDA
 
closely
 
on
 
consumer
 
feedback
 
on
 
this
 
issue.
 
 
Has  there  been  a  groundswell  of  consumer  comment  seeking  nutritional  and  ingredient  
information
 
labeling
 
on
 
sub-7%
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume
 
ciders
 
made
 
by
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
If  not,  is  it  worth  imposing  similar  requirements  on  thousands  of  struggling  small  distilleries  who  
collectively
 
represent
 
just
 
3%
 
of
 
the
 
spirits
 
market?
 
3  
 
TTB  Does  Have  the  Latitude  to  Exempt  Small  Businesses   
TTB  suggests  in  this  NPRM  that,  unlike  the  FDA,  it  can’t  exempt  small  businesses  from  these  
requirements.
 
It
 
makes
 
three
 
primary
 
arguments
 
to
 
support
 
this
 
position,
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
ACSA
 
vigorously
 
opposes.
 
 
TTB’s  First  Argument:  “One  of  the  primary  purposes  of  this  proposed  rule  is  to  provide  additional  information  to  
consumers.
 
This
 
purpose
 
would
 
be
 
weakened
 
by
 
a
 
permanent
 
exemption
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.”
  If  TTB  adopts  ACSA’s  proposed  100,000  proof  gallon  threshold  for  nutritional  information  
labeling,
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
spirits
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
with
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
would
 
jump
 
from
 
roughly
 
0%
 
to
 
roughly
 
97%.
 
This
 
represents
 
a
 
massive
 
increase
 
in
 
information
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
consumer
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
  The  increase  in  consumer  information  on  the  market  is  especially  drastic  considering  the  large  
proportion
 
of
 
small
 
producers’
 
volume
 
sold
 
in
 
their
 
tasting
 
rooms.
 
According
 
to
 
ACSA’s
 
annual
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Data
 
Project
 
survey,
 
the
 
smallest
 
2500
 
distilleries
 
tend
 
to
 
sell
 
nearly
 
50%
 
of
 
their
 
volume
 
within
 
their
 
own
 
tasting
 
rooms.
 
Consumers
 
buying
 
these
 
products
 
are
 
not
 
lacking
 
information
 
about
 
these
 
products-
 
we’re
 
doing
 
our
 
utmost
 
to
 
bombard
 
them
 
with
 
information
 
about
 
our
 
products
 
while
 
they’re
 
in
 
our
 
tasting
 
rooms.
  Further,  if  it’s  very  important  to  a  consumer  to  have  calorie  counts  on  their  alcohol  products,  they  
can
 
choose
 
to
 
buy
 
products
 
from
 
large
 
brands
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
include
 
that
 
information
 
in
 
their
 
labels.
 
They
 
can
 
vote
 
with
 
their
 
wallet.
 
Small
 
businesses
 
can
 
then
 
choose
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
include
 
that
 
info
 
on
 
their
 
labels
 
if
 
they
 
find
 
that
 
it’s
 
important
 
to
 
their
 
consumers.
 
  ACSA’s  members  report  that  they’ve  received  very  few  requests  for  this  information  from  
consumers.
 
In
 
a
 
member
 
survey,
 
just
 
4%
 
of
 
respondents
 
reported
 
that
 
consumers
 
had
 
ever
 
requested
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
contemplated
 
by
 
this
 
NPRM.
 
Compared
 
to
 
29%
 
of
 
survey
 
respondents
 
who
 
reported
 
having
 
received
 
consumer
 
inquiries
 
about
 
allergen
 
information,
 
that’s
 
quite
 
a
 
low
 
indication
 
of
 
consumer
 
demand
 
or
 
expectation
 
for
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
about
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
made
 
by
 
small
 
producers.
 
TTB’s  Second  Argument:  “TTB  questions  whether  a  permanent  exemption  from  mandatory  labeling  requirements  
would
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
mandate
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
labels
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity,
 
quality,
 
and
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
product.”
  The  above  argument  is  inconsistent  with  TTB’s  own  arguments  elsewhere  in  this  NPRM,  where  
TTB
 
establishes
 
its
 
authority
 
to
 
require
 
or
 
not
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
In
 
NPRM
 
4   
Section  II.  D.,  TTB  states  that  the  FAA  Act  and  the  federal  court  system  give  it  “broad  discretion”  
over
 
what
 
constitutes
 
“adequate
 
information”
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
labeling:
 
“The  FAA  Act  expressly  conveys  broad  discretion  to  the  agency  and  leaves  it  with  
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
prescribe
 
such
 
labeling
 
regulations
 
‘as
 
will
 
provide
 
the
 
consumer
 
with
 
adequate
 
information’
 
as
 
to,
 
among
 
other
 
things,
 
the
 
products’
 
‘identity
 
and
 
quality’
 
and
 
‘net
 
contents.’

U.S.C.
 
205(e).
 
In
 
1986,
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
ingredient
 
labeling,
 
the
 
D.C.
 
Circuit
 
recognized
 
that
 
the
 
obligation
 
under
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
‘to
 
ensure
 
that
 
disclosure
 
is
 
adequate
 
squarely
 
implicates
 
discretionary
 
judgment
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Secretary.
’
 
…
 
The
 
court
 
held
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
‘plain
 
meaning
 
of
 
the
 
phrase
 
‘adequate
 
information’
 
which
 
indicates
 
Congress’
 
intent
 
as
 
to
 
whether
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
either
 
requires
 
or
 
prohibits
 
ingredient
 
disclosure
 
regulations.’
 
…
 
The
 
court
 
upheld
 
ATF’s
 
conclusion
 
that
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
‘vests
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
zone
 
of
 
discretion
 
within
 
which
 
it
 
can
 
choose
 
to
 
require
 
or
 
not
 
require
 
ingredient
 
disclosure,
 
as
 
necessary
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information.’
 
Id.
 
It
 
is
 
TTB’s
 
view
 
that
 
rulemaking
 
on
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
similarly
 
falls
 
within
 
the
 
Secretary’s
 
discretion
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
such
 
information
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
‘‘adequate
 
information”
 
about
 
the
 
product.”
 
So  in  this  NPRM,  to  establish  its  authority  to  require  nutritional  information  labeling,  TTB  relies  
on
 
a
 
court
 
decision
 
in
 
favor
 
of
 
its
 
predecessor
 
agency’s
 
decision
 
not
 
to
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
That
 
decision
 
says
 
that
 
the
 
Secretary
 
has
 
broad
 
discretion
 
to
 
promulgate
 
these
 
rules
 
precisely
 
because
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
contains
 
no
 
guidance
 
whatsoever
 
on
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling.
 
Since
 
TTB
 
cites
 
this
 
decision
 
in
 
this
 
very
 
NPRM,
 
it
 
must
 
not
 
view
 
the
 
decision
 
as
 
outdated
 
or
 
incorrect.
 
And  yet  elsewhere  in  this  NPRM,  in  arguing  against  exempting  small  businesses  from  these  
new
 
rules,
 
TTB
 
says
 
it
 
questions
 
if
 
a
 
small
 
business
 
exemption
 
“would
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
mandate
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
labels
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information.”
 
But
 
if
 
TTB
 
not
 
only
 
agrees
 
with,
 
but
 
in
 
part
 
derives
 
its
 
authority
 
to
 
promulgate
 
these
 
rules
 
from,
 
the
 
court’s
 
finding
 
that
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
does
 
not
 
require
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling,
 
how
 
can
 
TTB
 
in
 
good
 
faith
 
argue
 
that
 
it
 
must
 
impose
 
new
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
on
 
small
 
businesses
 
because
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
requires
 
it
 
to?
 
TTB  can’t  have  it  both  ways.   
For  the  past  90  years,  TTB  and  its  predecessors  have  used  their  broad  discretion  in  this  area  to  
exempt
 
100%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
from
 
including
 
nutritional
 
information.
 
ACSA
 
asks
 
that
 
this
 
policy
 
be
 
continued
 
going
 
forward
 
for
 
spirits
 
produced
 
by
 
DSPs
 
whose
 
output
 
today
 
represents
 
just
 
3%
 
of
 
spirits
 
removed
 
from
 
bond.
 
5   
TTB’s  Third  Argument  
“TTB  notes  that  there  is  no  specific  statutory  authority  for  exempting  small  businesses  
from
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
under
 
the
 
Federal
 
Food,
 
Drug,
 
and
 
Cosmetic
 
Act
 
for
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
regulated
 
by
 
the
 
FDA.”
  Here,  TTB  suggests  that  it  lacks  the  authority  to  differentiate  these  regulations  based  on  size,  
because
 
while
 
FDA’s
 
authorizing
 
statute
 
requires
 
it
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
requirements,
 
TTB’s
 
does
 
not.
 
  TTB  draws  exactly  the  wrong  conclusion  from  FDA’s  small  business  exemptions.  The  existence  
of
 
a
 
statutory
 
exemption
 
at
 
another
 
agency
 
does
 
not
 
automatically
 
mean
 
that
 
TTB
 
lacks
 
authority
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
regulatory
 
exemption,
 
especially
 
considering
 
the
 
history.
  The  small  business  exemptions  in  the  1973  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act  predate  the  
1980
 
Regulatory
 
Flexibility
 
Act
 
(RFA).
 
In
 
1973,
 
agencies
 
needed
 
more
 
specific
 
authority
 
and
 
prompting
 
by
 
Congress
 
to
 
regulate
 
small
 
businesses
 
differently.
 
But
 
since
 
1980,
 
this
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
the
 
case.
 
In
 
the
 
RFA,
 
Congress
 
not
 
only
 
requires
 
that
 
agencies
 
consider
 
the
 
small
 
businesses
 
impact
 
of
 
new
 
rules.
 
It
 
also
 
states
 
that
 
agencies
 
must
 
consider
 
exemptions
 
for
 
small
 
businesses
 
when
 
contemplating
 
new
 
rules.
 
A
 
post-RFA
 
rulemaking
 
should
 
not
 
look
 
to
 
a
 
pre-RFA
 
rulemaking
 
for
 
guidance
 
on
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
Congress
 
vs.
 
the
 
Executive
 
in
 
establishing
 
small
 
business
 
exemptions.
 
Congress
 
did
 
direct
 
TTB
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
rules
 
like
 
this-
 
it
 
did
 
so
 
in
 
the
 
RFA.
  In  light  of  the  above,  ACSA  does  not  consider  TTB’s  analysis  of  small  business  exemptions  
adequate.
 
Further  RFA  Analysis  Requested   Per  the  US  SBA  Office  of  Advocacy  Guide  for  Government  Agencies  “How  to  Comply  with  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act” agencies  must  think  of  regulatory  impact  in  the  following  terms:    In  order  to  certify  a  rule  under  the  RFA,  an  agency  should  be  able  to  answer  the  following  types  
of
 
questions:
  1.  Which  small  entities  will  be  affected?  All  distilleries  will  be  affected  by  the  proposed  rule,  
without
 
exemptions.
 
Per
 
the
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Data
 
Project,
 
small
 
producers,
 
the
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
qualify
 
for
 
exemptions
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
rules,
 
which
 
we
 
think
 
would
 
be
 
reasonable,
 
number
 
about
 
2800
 
of
 
the
 
5300
 
licensed
 
distilleries
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
extremely
  
large
 
number
 
of
 
affected
 
small
 
businesses,
 
considering
 
that
 
97%
 
of
 
the
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
consumed
 
are
 
manufactured
 
by
 
large
 
conglomerates.
  2.  Have  adequate  economic  data  been  obtained?    
6   
In  Section  IX,  Cost  Analysis  of  Docket  No.  TTB-2025-0002;  Notice  No.  237  Alcohol  Facts  
Statements…,
 
TTB
 
gives
 
various
 
estimates
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
cost
 
borne
 
by
 
the
 
industry
 
through
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
labeling
 
requirements.
 
TTB
 
did
 
not
 
include
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
costs
 
incurred
 
by
 
companies
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
sales
 
value
 
of
 
such
 
products.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
under
 
the
 
RFA,
 
TTB
 
must
 
analyze
 
these
 
differences.
  For  each  individual  product,  graphic  design  costs  tend  to  be  thousands  of  dollars.  New  dies  for  
cutting
 
new
 
labels,
 
depending
 
on
 
size,
 
shape,
 
and
 
additional
 
features
 
such
 
as
 
embossing,
 
debossing,
 
or
 
foil,
 
can
 
cost
 
hundreds
 
to
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
For
 
an
 
ACSA
 
member
 
distillery
 
who
 
might
 
incur
 
these
 
costs
 
upfront
 
for
 
a
 
product
 
of
 
which
 
it
 
may
 
sell
 
just
 
hundreds
 
of
 
bottles,
 
and
 
those
 
at
 
a
 
price
 
depressed
 
to
 
compete
 
for
 
shelf
 
space
 
with
 
the
 
economies
 
of
 
scale
 
achieved
 
by
 
larger
 
industry
 
members,
 
these
 
costs
 
represent
 
a
 
significant
 
portion
 
of
 
revenue
 
from
 
that
 
product.
 
For
 
a
 
large
 
conglomerate
 
that
 
incurs
 
those
 
same
 
fees
 
but
 
amortises
 
them
 
over
 
millions
 
of
 
units
 
sold,
 
they’re
 
barely
 
a
 
consideration.
  The  alternative  to  re-printing  labels  would  be  to  add  a  new  label  for  the  sole  purpose  of  
containing
 
the
 
newly
 
required
 
information.
 
This
 
is
 
hardly
 
a
 
better
 
option,
 
as
 
it
 
requires
 
time
 
and
 
therefore
 
also
 
money.
 
For
 
small
 
distilleries
 
who
 
cannot
 
afford
 
automated
 
packaging
 
equipment,
 
adding
 
a
 
new
 
sticker
 
means
 
adding
 
a
 
new
 
person
 
to
 
the
 
bottling
 
team,
 
or
 
perhaps
 
just
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
existing
 
bottling
 
team’s
 
output
 
will
 
be
 
lowered.
 
Both
 
options
 
carry
 
significant
 
costs.
  3.  What  are  the  economic  implications/impacts  of  the  proposal  or  do  the  data  reveal  a  
significant
 
economic
 
impact
 
on
 
a
 
substantial
 
number
 
of
 
small
 
entities?
 
  Congress  also  states  that  “Agencies  should  not  give  a  narrow  reading  to  what  constitutes  a  
“significant
 
economic
 
impact”…a
 
determination
 
of
 
significant
 
economic
 
effect
 
is
 
not
 
limited
 
to
 
easily
 
quantifiable
 
costs.”
 
Congress
 
has
 
identified
 
several
 
examples
 
of
 
“significant
 
impact”:
 
a
 
rule
 
that
 
provides
 
a
 
strong
 
disincentive
 
to
 
seek
 
capital;
 
175
 
staff
 
hours
 
per
 
year
 
for
 
recordkeeping;
 
impacts
 
greater
 
than
 
the
 
$500
 
fine
 
(in
 
1980
 
dollars)
 
imposed
 
for
 
noncompliance;
 
new
 
capital
 
requirements
 
beyond
 
the
 
reach
 
of
 
the
 
entity;
 
and
 
any
 
impact
 
less
 
cost-efficient
 
than
 
another
 
reasonable
 
regulatory
 
alternative.
 
Note
 
that
 
even
 
below
 
these
 
thresholds,
 
impacts
 
may
 
be
 
significant.
 
Other,
 
more
 
specific
 
examples
 
are
 
contained
 
in
 
the
 
House
 
of
 
Representatives
 
Report
 
on
 
the
 
RFA.”
 
  Given  the  challenges  in  competition  in  the  spirits  industry  cited  in  President  Biden’s  E.O.  14036,  
Promoting
 
Competition
 
in
 
the
 
American
 
Economy
 
(July
 
9,
 
2022),
 
the
 
Executive
 
Order
 
directed
 
the
 
Secretary
 
of
 
the
 
Treasury,
 
through
 
the
 
Administrator
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
and
 
Tobacco
 
Tax
 
and
 
Trade
 
Bureau
 
(TTB),
 
to
 
consider:
 
(i)
 
initiating
 
rulemaking
 
to
 
update
 
TTB's
 
trade
 
practice
 
regulations;
 
(ii)
 
rescinding
 
or
 
revising
 
any
 
regulations
 
of
 
the
 
beer,
 
wine,
 
and
 
spirits
 
industries
 
that
 
may
 
unnecessarily
 
inhibit
 
competition;
 
and
 
(iii)
 
reducing
 
any
 
barriers
 
that
 
impede
 
market
 
access
 
for
 
smaller
 
and
 
independent
 
brewers,
 
winemakers,
 
and
 
distilleries.
 
  We  posit  that  the  TTB’s  exclusion  of  FDA’s  established  practice  of  providing  small  business  
exemptions
 
to
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
would
 
be
 
inhibiting
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
small
 
spirits
 
7   
producers  to  compete  effectively  in  an  industry  where  97%  of  the  spirits  removed  from  bond  are  
made
 
by
 
large
 
producers,
 
and
 
the
 
consolidation
 
of
 
companies
 
at
 
the
 
wholesale
 
and
 
retail
 
levels
 
would
 
make
 
it
 
difficult,
 
if
 
not
 
impossible
 
for
 
small
 
companies
 
to
 
recoup
 
any
 
of
 
these
 
costs.
 
In
 
fact,
 
these
 
expenditures
 
will
 
further
 
inhibit
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
small
 
companies
 
to
 
break
 
through
 
the
 
complete
 
market
 
domination
 
by
 
large
 
conglomerates. 
Alternate  Proposal:  Calorie  Statement  
In  the  event  that  TTB  will  not  consider  a  small  business  exemption,  ACSA  urges  TTB  to  
consider
 
less
 
burdensome
 
alternatives
 
to
 
the
 
panels
 
it
 
proposes.
 
We
 
support
 
the
 
various
 
alternatives
 
raised
 
in
 
TTB’s
 
NPRM,
 
such
 
as
 
QR
 
codes,
 
as
 
will
 
be
 
discussed
 
later
 
in
 
these
 
comments.
 
But
 
we
 
also
 
offer
 
a
 
new
 
proposal:
 
Where
 
the
 
only
 
net
 
new
 
information
 
not
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
a
 
label
 
would
 
be
 
calories,
 
just
 
require
 
that
 
the
 
calorie
 
count
 
be
 
disclosed
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
consistent
 
with
 
existing
 
TTB
 
rules
 
about
 
required
 
information.
  This  has  several  benefits.  First,  many  of  the  most  common  distilled  spirits  contain  nothing  more  
than
 
the
 
distillate
 
and
 
some
 
proofing
 
water,
 
and
 
will
 
therefore
 
have
 
very
 
little
 
added
 
information
 
in
 
either
 
the
 
panel
 
or
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
proposed
 
by
 
TTB.
 
Even
 
if
 
not
 
required
 
to
 
list
 
that
 
information
 
where
 
the
 
values
 
would
 
be
 
zero,
 
the
 
large
 
formats
 
of
 
these
 
proposed
 
displays
 
present
 
a
 
large
 
burden.
 
  In  addition,  the  existing  government  warning  could  be  expanded  to  include  a  statement  to  the  
effect
 
of
 
“this
 
product
 
contains
 
no
 
nutritive
 
value.”
 
Dispelling
 
the
 
potential
 
consumer
 
misconception
 
that
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
products
 
contain
 
meaningful
 
nutrition,
 
within
 
the
 
existing
 
display
 
of
 
government
 
health
 
disclaimers
 
about
 
alcohol
 
consumption,
 
would
 
accomplish
 
public
 
health
 
aims
 
without
 
requiring
 
as
 
extensive
 
a
 
cost
 
burden
 
of
 
our
 
small
 
distillers.
 
It
 
would
 
also
 
clarify
 
why
 
no
 
nutritional
 
information
 
beyond
 
calorie
 
count
 
is
 
contained
 
on
 
that
 
product’s
 
label.
  To  support  this  proposal,  ACSA  examined  the  impact  of  TTB’s  proposed  displays  on  label  
surface
 
area.
 
In
 
small
 
formats
 
with
 
geometric
 
limitations,
 
every
 
tiny
 
scrap
 
of
 
label
 
is
 
vital
 
real
 
estate.
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
example
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
panel
 
and
 
linear
 
display
 
provided
 
by
 
TTB
 
in
 
the
 
NPRM
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
with
 
ACSA
 
coloring
 
and
 
annotation:
 
8   
 
The  vast  majority  of  the  valuable  space  occupied  by  both  displays  is  dedicated  to  redundant  
information
 
or
 
takes
 
up
 
valuable
 
space
 
for
 
no
 
reason
 
other
 
than
 
to
 
mirror
 
FDA’s
 
nutritional
 
information
 
format.
 
The
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume
 
and
 
proof
 
are
 
redundant
 
pieces
 
of
 
information
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
labels.
 
Fl
 
oz
 
of
 
alcohol
 
is
 
another
 
way
 
of
 
stating
 
the
 
same
 
information,
 
but
 
in
 
a
 
less
 
usable
 
format
 
for
 
consumers.
 
As
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
example
 
panel,
 
there
 
will
 
in
 
many
 
if
 
not
 
most
 
cases
 
be
 
zero
 
value
 
associated
 
with
 
carbohydrate,
 
fat,
 
and
 
protein
 
on
 
most
 
common
 
distilled
 
spirits.
 
And
 
the
 
serving
 
size
 
is
 
a
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
very
 
widely
 
disseminated
 
by
 
the
 
CDC.
  The  only  entirely  new  piece  of  information,  the  calorie  count,  takes  up  less  than  3%  of  the  panel  
display’s
 
surface
 
area,
 
and
 
slightly
 
more
 
than
 
4%
 
of
 
the
 
linear
 
display’s
 
area.
 
We
 
believe
 
there
 
are
 
better
 
ways
 
to
 
deliver
 
this
 
information
 
that
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
lower
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens.
 
These
 
bulky
 
displays
 
will
 
be
 
difficult
 
to
 
fit
 
into
 
carefully
 
balanced
 
works
 
of
 
graphic
 
design
 
on
 
small
 
packages,
 
all
 
to
 
add
 
relatively
 
little
 
new
 
information.
  ACSA’s  proposal  to  simply  require  a  calorie  statement  would  take  up  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  space  
that
 
these
 
TTB
 
proposals
 
would,
 
and
 
it
 
would
 
add
 
almost
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
information.

Any  New  Regulation  Must  Reflect  Digital  Reality  
ACSA  members  are  concerned  by  the  difficult-to-understand  enforcement  of  existing  regulations  
about
 
the
 
depiction
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
labels
 
online.
 
They’re
 
concerned
 
that
 
this
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
regulations
 
might
 
increase
 
online
 
compliance
 
risk
 
without
 
meaningful
 
public
 
health
 
benefit.
 
A
 
case
 
study
 
from
 
an
 
ACSA
 
member
 
distillery
 
will
 
illustrate
 
the
 
cause
 
for
 
concern:
   An  ACSA  member  was  contacted  by  TTB’s  Market  Compliance  Office.  They  told  him  
that
 
a
 
product
 
photo
 
on
 
his
 
website
 
was
 
too
 
low
 
resolution
 
for
 
the
 
required
 
statement
 
of
 
disclosure
 
of
 
caramel
 
coloring
 
to
 
be
 
legible,
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
initiating
 
a
 
broader
 
audit
 
of
 
his
 
DSP’s
 
practices
 
as
 
a
 
result.
  Looking  through  the  DSP’s  digital  presence,  the  TTB  representatives  told  the  DSP  
operator
 
that
 
if
 
he
 
posts
 
a
 
photo
 
of
 
a
 
product
 
that
 
has
 
the
 
caramel
 
/
 
food
 
color
 
disclosure
 
on
 
the
 
rear
 
label,
 
which
 
is
 
allowed
 
by
 
COLAs,
 
he
 
must
 
also
 
post
 
a
 
photo
 
of
 
the
 
rear
 
label
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
disclosure.
  The  DSP  operator  asked  if  he  also  had  to  ensure  the  Government  Warning  and  alcohol  
content
 
statement
 
were
 
legible
 
as
 
well.
 
They
 
told
 
him
 
that
 
no,
 
it’s
 
just
 
about
 
the
 
coloring
 
disclosures.
  The  TTB  representatives  further  informed  him  that  if  any  consumer  were  to  post  a  photo  
on
 
social
 
media
 
of
 
his
 
product
 
without
 
the
 
coloring
 
statement
 
being
 
legible,
 
and
 
the
 
DSP’s
 
social
 
media
 
account
 
liked
 
the
 
photo,
 
that
 
would
 
constitute
 
a
 
prohibited
 
market
 
practice.
  The  above  story  indicates  an  inexplicable  prioritization  of  the  legibility  of  a  label  statement  that,  
while
 
required,
 
is
 
orders
 
of
 
magnitude
 
less
 
important
 
to
 
a
 
consumer
 
than,
 
for
 
example,
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
Yet
 
TTB
 
viewed
 
this
 
as
 
an
 
important
 
enough
 
issue
 
to
 
initiate
 
a
 
broader
 
investigation.
 
In
 
light
 
of
 
stories
 
like
 
this,
 
when
 
ACSA
 
members
 
are
 
confronted
 
with
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
a
 
broad
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
labeling
 
requirements,
 
they
 
understandably
 
wonder
 
if
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
enforced
 
in
 
a
 
sensible
 
manner.
 
  ACSA  therefore  requests  that  TTB  take  a  hard  look  at  how  any  new  proposed  labeling  
regulation
 
would
 
relate
 
to
 
its
 
rules
 
about
 
online
 
conduct.
 
It
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
practical
 
or
 
in
 
many
 
cases
 
even
 
possible
 
to
 
show
 
100%
 
of
 
label
 
information
 
on
 
a
 
three-dimensional
 
object
 
in
 
many
 
forms
 
of
 
online
 
communication
 
or
 
marketing.
 
The
 
rules
 
need
 
to
 
reflect
 
that.
 
And
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
prioritize
 
what
 
information
 
truly
 
matters
 
most.
  
10   
ANSWERS  TO  SPECIFIC  TTB  QUESTIONS  
TTB’s  NPRM  asks  for  input  on  a  number  of  specific  questions.  Below  we  provide  answers  to  
those
 
questions
 
not
 
answered
 
elsewhere
 
in
 
these
 
comments.
 
 
Alcohol  Facts  
1.  Title  of  the  Alcohol  Beverage  Information  Statement  
1.1.  Which  title,  ‘‘Serving  Facts’’  or  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts,’’  would  be  more  informative  
to
 
consumers?
 
Does
 
the
 
title
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
better
 
describe
 
the
 
information
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
statement,
 
which
 
includes
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information?
 
 
“Serving  Facts”  more  clearly  communicates  that  this  applies  to  the  specific  
product.
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
sounds
 
like
 
it
 
applies
 
generally
 
to
 
alcohol,
 
not
 
necessarily
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
product
 
in
 
question,
 
as
 
though
 
the
 
same
 
information
 
might
 
be
 
on
 
every
 
label
 
for
 
every
 
product.
 
The
 
same
 
way
 
we
 
all
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
“Government
 
Warning”
 
label.
 
 
The  proposed  panel  already  says  “serving”  and  “Serving  facts”  in  multiple  
locations.
 
1.2.  Would  the  use  of  the  title  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts’’  affect  compliance  costs  or  
regulatory
 
burdens
 
by
 
requiring
 
a
 
title
 
change
 
for
 
products
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
labeled
 
with
 
a
 
‘‘Serving
 
Facts’’
 
statement?
 
 
Yes.  Any  change  requires  paying  graphic  design  fees  and  additional  printing  
fees.
 
1.3.  Are  consumers  accustomed  to  finding  nutrient  content  information  in  a  
Serving
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
Would
 
changing
 
the
 
title
 
to
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
cause
 
confusion?
 
Yes,  “Alcohol  Facts”  sounds  like  it’s  telling  consumers  facts  about  alcohol  in  
general.
 
This
 
may
 
be
 
confusing.
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
sounds
 
more
 
familiar
 
based
 
on
 
existing
 
FDA
 
Nutritional
 
Facts,
 
and
 
makes
 
more
 
clear
 
that
 
it
 
applies
 
to
 
a
 
single
 
serving
 
of
 
the
 
labeled
 
product.
 
In  a  significant  number  of  alcoholic  beverages,  the  majority  of  the  calories,  fats,  
and
 
sugars
 
can
 
come
 
from
 
ingredients
 
in
 
the
 
beverages
 
which
 
have
 
nothing
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
ethanol.
 
Take
 
for
 
example
 
a
 
canned
 
Pina
 
Colada,
 
which
 
would
 
likely
 
contain
 
considerable
 
amounts
 
of
 
added
 
sugar
 
and
 
fat,
 
whose
 
additional
 
calories
 
would
 
not
 
be
 
from
 
alcohol.
 
11   
1.4.  Alternatively,  does  the  title  ‘‘Alcohol  Facts’’  make  it  easier  for  consumers  to  
readily
 
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items?
 
We  do  not  consider  this  a  serious  concern.  Other  labeling  regulations  make  it  
clear
 
what
 
product
 
is
 
what.
 
Whiskey
 
says
 
“whiskey”
 
on
 
it,
 
ketchup
 
says
 
“ketchup”
 
on
 
it.
 
Consumers
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
product
 
name,
 
not
 
the
 
fine
 
print
 
to
 
identify
 
products.
 
 
2.  Mandatory  Calorie  and  Nutrient  Information  
2.1.  TTB  specifically  seeks  comments  on  whether  fat  and  protein,  which  are  not  
typically
 
found
 
in
 
certain
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
only
 
if
 
present
 
at
 
specific
 
levels.
 
If
 
so,
 
what
 
levels
 
should
 
trigger
 
these
 
requirements?
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
any
 
other
 
nutrients,
 
such
 
as
 
sodium,
 
caffeine,
 
or
 
sugar,
 
should
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
if
 
present
 
at
 
a
 
specific
 
level,
 
even
 
if
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
otherwise
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed.
 
Yes,  only  require  fat  and  protein  to  be  disclosed  if  above  a  certain  threshold.  
Requiring
 
space
 
for
 
those
 
to
 
be
 
set
 
aside
 
on
 
most
 
labels,
 
where
 
the
 
amount
 
will
 
be
 
zero,
 
will
 
be
 
unnecessarily
 
disruptive
 
and
 
expensive.
 
Some  Standards  of  Identity  allow  any  number  of  added  ingredients,  and  many  
products
 
conform
 
to
 
Standards
 
of
 
Identity
 
which
 
do
 
not
 
allow
 
any
 
additives.
 
TTB
 
should
 
consider
 
allowing
 
minimal
 
information
 
for
 
such
 
Standards
 
of
 
Identity,
 
reserving
 
the
 
full
 
panel
 
for
 
those
 
products
 
with
 
added
 
flavors,
 
fats
 
and
 
sugars.
 
For  example,  a  bourbon  is  not  permitted  to  contain  any  Coloring,  Flavoring,  or  
Blending
 
materials.
 
If
 
it
 
meets
 
the
 
standard
 
of
 
identity,
 
it
 
should
 
contain
 
no
 
added
 
sugar,
 
fat,
 
or
 
protein,
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
list
 
their
 
concentrations.
 
2.2.  Should  TTB’s  proposed  nutrient  content  labeling  statement  be  more  
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
Nutrition
 
Facts
 
Label
 
found
 
on
 
foods
 
that
 
are
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction?
 
Alternatively,
 
do
 
the
 
differences
 
between
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
and
 
other
 
foods
 
make
 
it
 
unnecessary,
 
or
 
even
 
misleading,
 
to
 
adopt
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
required
 
on
 
food
 
labels
 
that
 
are
 
under
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction?
 
For
 
example,
 
would
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
daily
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
listed
 
nutrients
 
provided
 
by
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
be
 
useful
 
information
 
for
 
consumers?
 
Alternatively,
 
could
 
such
 
statements
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
implying
 
that
 
they
 
may
 
rely
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
consumption
 
to
 
satisfy
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
daily
 
nutrient
 
requirements?
 
Displaying  nutritional  information  in  the  same  exact  manner  as  food  labels  might  
mislead
 
consumers.
 
Without
 
a
 
thorough
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
 
an
 
ingredient
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
processed
 
in
 
the
 
fermentation
 
and
 
distillation
 
process,
 
they
 
might
 
think
 
its
 
inclusion
 
on
 
an
 
ingredient
 
list,
 
alongside
 
a
 
nutrition
 
facts
 
panel,
 
means
 
there’s
 
12   
nutritive  value  in  the  product.  Alcoholic  beverages  should  not  be  regarded  as  a  
source
 
of
 
nutrition,
 
and
 
should
 
therefore
 
be
 
labeled
 
differently
 
to
 
make
 
that
 
clear.
 
2.3.  For  greater  consistency  with  the  FDA  Nutrition  Facts  Label,  should  Alcohol  
Facts
 
statements
 
be
 
allowed
 
or
 
required
 
to
 
include
 
other
 
elements
 
(such
 
as
 
sodium
 
and
 
cholesterol)
 
or
 
a
 
further
 
breakdown
 
of
 
fat
 
(to
 
include
 
saturated
 
fat
 
and
 
trans-fat)?
 
TTB’s  required  statements,  if  this  rule  is  adopted,  should  only  require  listing  of  
elements
 
that
 
are
 
commonly
 
found
 
in
 
significant
 
amounts
 
in
 
spirits
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
class
 
and
 
type.
 
Additions
 
of
 
other
 
elements
 
should
 
be
 
allowed
 
but
 
not
 
required.
 
2.4.  Would  the  inclusion  of  elements  not  ordinarily  expected  to  be  found  in  
alcohol
 
beverages
 
(such
 
as
 
trans-fat
 
and
 
dietary
 
fiber)
 
be
 
useful
 
or
 
potentially
 
misleading?
 
This  would  not  be  useful.  It  would  be  akin  to  requiring  a  statement  of  alcohol  
content
 
on
 
cartons
 
of
 
milk.
 
This
 
would
 
be
 
misleading.
 
Consumers
 
would
 
see
 
the
 
contents
 
labeled
 
as
 
zero,
 
but
 
the
 
implication
 
of
 
its
 
inclusion
 
would
 
be
 
that
 
many
 
similar
 
products
 
must
 
have
 
a
 
significant
 
enough
 
concentration
 
of
 
the
 
element
 
in
 
question
 
that
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
its
 
content
 
be
 
included,
 
when
 
in
 
fact
 
the
 
opposite
 
is
 
true.
 
This
 
would
 
create
 
the
 
question
 
in
 
consumers’
 
minds-
 
have
 
I
 
been
 
unknowingly
 
consuming
 
products
 
containing
 
this
 
element,
 
but
 
I
 
just
 
never
 
noticed?
 
2.5.  Should  TTB  allow  numerical  statements  of  the  vitamin  and  mineral  content  
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
assuming
 
the
 
product
 
contains
 
vitamins
 
or
 
minerals,
 
or
 
could
 
such
 
a
 
statement
 
create
 
an
 
erroneous
 
impression
 
that
 
consumption
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
has
 
nutritional
 
value
 
or
 
other
 
health
 
related
 
benefits?
 
 
No.
 
This
 
would
 
muddy
 
the
 
waters
 
regarding
 
the
 
prohibition
 
on
 
making
 
health
 
claims
 
on
 
spirits
 
labels.
 
We
 
maintain
 
our
 
stance
 
that
 
alcohol
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
considered
 
to
 
have
 
nutritive
 
value.
 
2.6.  How  many  industry  members  already  provide  nutrient  content  information  
on
 
labels,
 
in
 
advertisements
 
(such
 
as
 
websites),
 
or
 
upon
 
request
 
(for
 
example,
 
to
 
consumers
 
or
 
restaurants)?
 
 
 
In
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
our
 
members,
 
3%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
they
 
include
 
this
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
labels.
 
 
2.7.  Do  consumers  want  to  see  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  on  alcohol  beverage  
products?
 
How
 
might
 
consumers
 
benefit
 
from
 
such
 
a
 
label?
 
Do
 
consumers
 
have
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
alcohol
 
13   
beverages  if  alcohol  beverage  containers  do  not  include  Alcohol  Facts  
labeling?
 
How
 
do
 
those
 
benefits
 
compare
 
to
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
associated
 
with
 
such
 
revisions?
 
 
In
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
our
 
members,
 
just
 
4%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
consumers
 
had
 
ever
 
requested
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
from
 
their
 
companies.
 
Compare
 
that
 
to
 
29%
 
of
 
respondents
 
said
 
consumers
 
had
 
requested
 
allergen
 
info.
 
 
 
Very,
 
very
 
few
 
of
 
our
 
consumers
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
this
 
information
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
broad
 
understanding
 
that
 
alcohol
 
does
 
not
 
contain
 
nutritive
 
value.
 
2.8.  How,  if  at  all,  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  
competition
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
market?
 
 
 
Every
 
additional
 
regulatory
 
requirement
 
disproportionately
 
burdens
 
small
 
businesses.
 
This
 
common-sense
 
principle
 
is
 
behind
 
countless
 
federal
 
laws
 
and
 
regulations,
 
including
 
of
 
course
 
the
 
Regulatory
 
Flexibility
 
Act.
 
For
 
us,
 
a
 
dollar
 
spent
 
on
 
graphic
 
design
 
fees
 
or
 
label
 
printing
 
means
 
a
 
dollar
 
not
 
spent
 
on
 
wages,
 
on
 
marketing,
 
or
 
on
 
our
 
many
 
other
 
under-funded
 
needs
 
costs.
 
 
 
For
 
the
 
large
 
producers
 
that
 
dominate
 
the
 
market,
 
a
 
dollar
 
spent
 
on
 
meeting
 
these
 
requirements
 
means
 
a
 
dollar
 
less
 
of
 
their
 
multi-million
 
or
 
-billion
 
dollar
 
profits.
 
As
 
small
 
producers
 
are
 
already
 
burdened
 
disproportionally
 
to
 
their
 
market
 
or
 
tax
 
liability
 
impact
 
in
 
reporting
 
requirements,
 
this
 
will
 
add
 
an
 
extra
 
level
 
of
 
testing
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
labels
 
are
 
accurate,
 
or
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
not,
 
a
 
more
 
serious
 
vulnerability
 
to
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
any
 
TTB
 
penalties
 
or
 
costs
 
of
 
initiating
 
corrections,
 
if
 
the
 
labels
 
are
 
found
 
during
 
examination
 
to
 
be
 
insufficiently
 
accurate.
 
2.9.  How  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  small  
businesses
 
and,
 
in
 
particular,
 
new
 
businesses
 
entering
 
into
 
the
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
marketplace?
 
 
See  above.  
2.10.  How,  if  at  all,  would  the  new  mandatory  labeling  requirements  affect  
international
 
trade
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages?
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
information
 
that
 
should,
 
or
 
should
 
not,
 
be
 
included
 
to
 
align
 
the
 
proposed
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
with
 
those
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
Alignment  to  international  standards  are  generally  to  be  desired.  Costs  of  
changes
 
to
 
labels
 
for
 
export
 
purposes
 
are
 
again,
 
disproportionately
 
impactful
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.

3.  Calculating  Panel  Elements  and  Tolerance  Levels  
3.1.  TTB  seeks  comments  on  whether  the  proposed  tolerances  are  broad  
enough
 
to
 
facilitate
 
reliance
 
on
 
databases
 
for
 
standard
 
products,
 
among
 
other
 
methods
 
for
 
calculating
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
content,
 
but
 
still
 
specific
 
enough
 
to
 
provide
 
accurate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
Specifically,
 
TTB
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
it
 
should
 
instead
 
propose
 
the
 
same
 
tolerances
 
set
 
forth
 
in
 
TTB
 
Procedure
 
2020–1
 
or
 
whether
 
another
 
approach
 
should
 
be
 
considered.
 
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
real
 
concern.
 
For
 
small
 
producers
 
especially,
 
the
 
least
 
expensive
 
methods
 
are
 
those
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
used,
 
and
 
without
 
clear
 
guidance
 
from
 
TTB
 
on
 
acceptable
 
calculators,
 
many
 
will
 
use
 
what
 
they
 
find
 
online.
 
TTB
 
should
 
consider
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
when
 
calculating
 
tolerance
 
-
 
small
 
producers
 
making
 
hundreds
 
of
 
units
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
judged
 
like
 
large
 
conglomerates
 
producing
 
millions
 
of
 
units.
 
4.  Mandatory  Listing  of  Alcohol  by  Volume  on  All  Alcohol  Beverage  
Products
 
 
4.1.  What  are  the  potential  benefits  to  consumers  and  industry  members  from  a  
requirement
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements,
 
expressed
 
as
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume,
 
on
 
the
 
labels
 
of
 
all
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
products?
 
 
ACSA  advocates  for  parity  in  alcohol  regulations  between  product  categories,  
and
 
this
 
is
 
no
 
different.
 
Ethanol
 
is
 
ethanol.
 
Beer
 
and
 
wine
 
should
 
have
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
guidelines
 
that
 
spirits
 
do.
 
 
There’s
 
no
 
compelling
 
reason
 
that
 
a
 
spirit-based
 
RTD
 
with
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
12%
 
should
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
carry
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
while
 
a
 
table
 
wine
 
containing
 
12%
 
alcohol
 
does
 
not.
 
Alcohol
 
is
 
a
 
controlled
 
substance
 
and
 
consumers
 
deserve
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
it
 
they
 
are
 
consuming.
 
 
This  disparity  in  labeling  regulations  is  part  of  the  increasingly  outdated  
penalization
 
of
 
spirits
 
relative
 
to
 
beer
 
and
 
wine.
 
It
 
is
 
also
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
flawed
 
assumption
 
that
 
products
 
from
 
these
 
different
 
product
 
categories
 
are
 
always
 
consumed
 
in
 
a
 
particular
 
manner-
 
e.g.,
 
that
 
wine
 
is
 
consumed
 
thoughtfully
 
with
 
dinner
 
while
 
spirits
 
are
 
downed
 
by
 
the
 
shot
 
at
 
a
 
saloon.
 
Wines
 
may
 
be
 
consumed
 
irresponsibly,
 
while
 
spirits
 
may
 
be
 
slowly
 
sipped
 
and
 
savored.
 
Parity
 
in
 
labeling
 
alcohol
 
content
 
regulations
 
would
 
remove
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
the
 
information
 
consumers
 
need
 
to
 
make
 
responsible
 
decisions
 
about
 
their
 
alcohol
 
consumption.
 
4.2.  Will  the  proposed  requirement  for  alcohol  content  labeling  for  all  beer  and  
malt
 
beverages
 
result
 
in
 
additional
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
for
 
brewers
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
small
 
businesses?
 
Will
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
alcohol
 
15   
content  tolerances  mitigate  or  reduce  those  costs  and  burdens?   
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
brewers
 
on
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
of
 
this
 
issue.
 
4.3.  Will  the  proposed  increase  in  alcohol  content  tolerances  for  malt  beverages  
mislead
 
consumers?
 
If
 
so,
 
does
 
the
 
same
 
argument
 
apply
 
to
 
wines,
 
which
 
currently
 
have
 
a
 
1.5
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
wines
 
up
 
to
 
14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume,
 
and
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
wines
 
with
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
over
 
14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume?
 
 
TTB
 
suggests
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM
 
that
 
its
 
proposal
 
to
 
increase
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
is
 
in
 
large
 
part
 
out
 
of
 
consideration
 
for
 
the
 
concern
 
of
 
small
 
brewers.
  
The
 
NPRM
 
notes
 
that
 
the
 
Brewers’
 
Association
 
and
 
independent
 
brewers
 
argued
 
in
 
past
 
rulemaking
 
processes
 
that
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
accurate
 
compliance
 
is
 
burdensome
 
to
 
small
 
producers
 
and
 
would
 
deter
 
new
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
starting.
 
 
 
ACSA
 
completely
 
agrees
 
with
 
the
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
Brewers
 
Association
 
and
 
the
 
independent
 
brewers
 
referred
 
to
 
in
 
TTB’s
 
NPRM.
 
It
 
is
 
too
 
expensive
 
and
 
too
 
difficult
 
for
 
small
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
producers
 
to
 
meet
 
a
 
0.3%
 
percentage
 
point
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
tolerance.
 
 
 
NEW
 
ACSA
 
PROPOSAL:
 
INCREASE
 
ALCOHOL
 
CONTENT
 
TOLERANCES
 
FOR
 
SMALL
 
BREWERIES
 
AND
 
DISTILLERIES
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
proceeding
 
with
 
this
 
proposal
 
despite
 
opposition
 
from
 
the
 
Beer
 
Institute,
 
which
 
tends
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
larger
 
beer
 
brands.
 
We
 
applaud
 
TTB’s
 
consideration
 
for
 
the
 
challenges
 
particular
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
 
But
 
applying
 
this
 
tolerance
 
to
 
large
 
and
 
small
 
breweries
 
alike
 
is
 
unwise.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
labeling
 
tolerance
 
represents
 
a
 
massive
 
variation
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content
 
for
 
relatively
 
low-alcohol
 
malt
 
beverages
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
varieties.
 
This
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
dangerous
 
discrepancy
 
between
 
the
 
true
 
and
 
expected
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages.
 
 
Many
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
Malt
 
Beverages
 
are
 
Hard
 
Seltzers,
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
of
 
which
 
tend
 
to
 
contain
 
about
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
on
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
constitutes
 
a
 
20%
 
tolerance
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
The
 
below
 
chart
 
demonstrates
 
that
 
with
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance,
 
a
 
12-oz
 
can
 
of
 
malt
 
beverage
 
with
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
might
 
contain
 
anywhere
 
from
 
11.2
 
to
 
16.8
 
mL
 
of
 
Ethyl
 
Alcohol,
 
or
 
0.8
 
to
 
1.2
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
Put
 
another
 
way,
 
a
 
can
 
containing
 
.8
 
standard
 
drinks
 
could
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
as
 
a
 
can
 
containing
 
1.2
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
16   
 
This  effect  is  more  dangerously  exaggerated  when  extrapolated  to  a  binge  
drinking
 
session.
 
Five
 
12-oz
 
cans
 
of
 
malt
 
beverage
 
with
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
might
 
contain
 
anywhere
 
from
 
four
 
to
 
six
 
standard
 
drinks
 
with
 
a
 
1%
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance.
 
Imagine
 
a
 
consumer
 
who
 
on
 
one
 
occasion
 
drank
 
five
 
cans
 
of
 
the
 
malt
 
beverage
 
in
 
question,
 
and
 
that
 
batch
 
had
 
an
 
actual
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
4%
 
by
 
volume.
 
They
 
felt
 
confident
 
they
 
were
 
under
 
the
 
legal
 
limit,
 
then
 
drove
 
home.
 
A
 
couple
 
weeks
 
later,
 
they
 
drink
 
five
 
cans
 
from
 
a
 
different
 
batch.
 
This
 
one
 
has
 
an
 
actual
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
6%.
 
They
 
consumed
 
fifty
 
percent
 
more
 
alcohol
 
than
 
last
 
time,
 
but
 
the
 
package
 
says
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
is
 
the
 
same.
 
Might
 
they
 
assume
 
that
 
since
 
they
 
were
 
OK
 
to
 
drive
 
last
 
time,
 
they’re
 
probably
 
ok
 
this
 
time?
 
Applying  a  1%  tolerance  to  malt  beverages  produced  by  small  brewers  and  a  .3%  
tolerance
 
to
 
large
 
brewers
 
would
 
address
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
concerns
 
TTB
 
is
 
juggling
 
here.
 
It
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages
 
from
 
small
 
breweries
 
more
 
information
 
than
 
labels
 
currently
 
require,
 
while
 
acknowledging
 
the
 
reality
 
that
 
small
 
brewers
 
have
 
a
 
difficult
 
time
 
maintaining
 
precision
 
in
 
this
 
arena.
 
And
 
the
 
.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
applied
 
to
 
large
 
brewers’
 
malt
 
beverages
 
would
 
apply
 
a
 
rigorous
 
standard
 
to
 
the
 
vast,
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
malt
 
beverage
 
market,
 
addressing
 
the
 
consumer
 
information
 
concerns
 
in
 
most
 
situations.
 
 
For  the  most  popular  distilled  spirits,  the  math  works  out  very  differently.  For  a  
standard
 
serving
 
of
 
1.5
 
Oz.
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits,
 
the
 
current
 
0.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
results
 
in
 
a
 
permissible
 
range
 
of
 
17.9
 
to
 
18.1
 
mL
 
of
 
ethyl
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
1.007
 
to
 
1.022
 
standard
 
drinks.
 
A
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
1.5-Oz.
 
serving
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits
 
containing
 
17.6
 
to
 
18.5
 
mL
 
of
 
ethyl
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
17  
 
0.99  to  1.04  standard  drinks.  This  represents  a  variation  in  ethyl  alcohol  content  
of
 
just
 
2.5%
 
relative
 
to
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
This
 
is
 
less
 
variation
 
than
 
exists
 
under
 
even
 
the
 
current
 
.3
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
on
 
a
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
beverage.
 
 
Applying  the  lens  of  a  five-serving  binge  drinking  session  to  this  tolerance  
question
 
in
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
we
 
again
 
find
 
that
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
minimal
 
variation
 
in
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed.
 
At
 
a
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
40%,
 
the
 
proposed
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed
 
of
 
4.95
 
to
 
5.2.
 
In
 
both
 
cases,
 
essentially
 
five
 
drinks.
 
Compare
 
this
 
to
 
the
 
50%
 
swing
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
4
 
drinks
 
to
 
6
 
drinks
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
in
 
a
 
5%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
Malt
 
Beverage.
 
We  need  to  point  out  that  of  course  distilled  spirits  can  have  low  alcohol  contents  
as
 
well,
 
and
 
can
 
therefore
 
also
 
experience
 
the
 
large
 
relative
 
swings
 
from
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance.
 
 
But  we  argue  that  regulations  should  be  built  around  market  realities.  Most  spirits  
on
 
the
 
market
 
are
 
of
 
higher
 
proof
 
than
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
and
 
therefore
 
the
 
same
 
label
 
tolerance
 
results
 
in
 
a
 
tighter
 
range
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
There’s
 
a
 
reason
 
CDC
 
expresses
 
its
 
standard
 
drink
 
guidance
 
for
 
spirits
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
80-proof
 
spirits:
 
it’s
 
something
 
of
 
an
 
industry
 
standard
 
and
 
a
 
consumer
 
expectation.
 
In
 
the
 
RTD
 
beverage
 
space,
 
where
 
malt
 
beverages
 
and
 
spirits-based
 
RTDs
 
tend
 
to
 
most
 
often
 
have
 
similar
 
alcohol
 
contents,
 
malt
 
beverages
 
account
 
for
 
a
 
much
 
larger
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
market.
 
They
 
tend
 
to
 
enjoy
 
lower
 
excise
 
tax
 
rates
 
and
 
less
 
18  
 
restrictive  distribution  and  retailing  regimes  than  spirit-based  RTDs,  so  large  
companies
 
often
 
favor
 
them,
 
and
 
they’re
 
more
 
widely
 
available
 
to
 
consumers.
 
The  discrepancy  in  market  position  between  malt  beverage-  and  spirit-based  
RTDs
 
described
 
above
 
is
 
especially
 
true
 
among
 
smaller
 
craft
 
distilleries
 
to
 
whom
 
we
 
propose
 
that
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
apply.
 
The
 
processing
 
and
 
canning
 
equipment
 
required
 
to
 
produce
 
these
 
is
 
too
 
expensive
 
for
 
most
 
small
 
distilleries
 
to
 
purchase.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
only
 
a
 
relatively
 
small
 
portion
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
produced
 
by
 
small
 
distillers
 
under
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
low
 
enough
 
alcohol
 
content
 
to
 
experience
 
a
 
significant
 
variation
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
We  also  acknowledge  that  labeled  vs.  actual  alcohol  content  carries  different  tax  
implications
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
than
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages
 
and
 
wines.
 
Of
 
course
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
are
 
taxed
 
on
 
a
 
proof
 
gallon
 
basis,
 
where
 
other
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
taxed
 
by
 
volume,
 
or
 
by
 
volume
 
within
 
alcohol
 
content
 
ranges.
 
There
 
is
 
therefore
 
a
 
potential
 
concern
 
that
 
if
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
have
 
a
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
tolerance,
 
tax
 
revenue
 
could
 
be
 
impacted.
 
If
 
a
 
spirit
 
labeled
 
at
 
40%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
and
 
is
 
taxed
 
accordingly,
 
but
 
in
 
fact
 
contains
 
40.6%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol,
 
that
 
spirit
 
was
 
undertaxed.
 
But  TTB’s  data  shows  that  the  potential  revenue  impact  of  a  1  percentage  point  
alcohol
 
content
 
tolerance
 
for
 
distillers
 
removing
 
less
 
than
 
100,000
 
Proof
 
Gallons
 
from
 
bond
 
per
 
year
 
would
 
be
 
minimal.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
most
 
recently
 
released
 
version
 
of
 
TTB’s
 
“Statistical
 
Report
 
-
 
Distilled
 
Spirits
 
Permit
 
Counts
 
and
 
Average
 
Removals
 
by
 
Year,”
 
distillers
 
of
 
this
 
size
 
accounted
 
for
 
about
 
94.5%
 
of
 
DSPs
 
and
 
about
 
3.5%
 
of
 
taxable
 
removals
 
in
 
2022.
 
Assuming
 
that
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
removals
 
were
 
taxed
 
at
 
the
 
$2.70
 
/
 
Proof
 
Gallon
 
rate,
 
the
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
from
 
these
 
small
 
distillers
 
amounted
 
to
 
about
 
$35
 
million,
 
or
 
less
 
than
 
1%
 
of
 
total
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
that
 
year.
 
Against  that  $35  million  total  the  current  allowable  .3  percentage  point  tolerance  
could
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
maximum
 
variation
 
in
 
excise
 
tax
 
income
 
of
 
$105,177.
 
This
 
would
 
only
 
occur
 
if
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
spirits
 
in
 
this
 
category
 
were
 
the
 
full
 
.3
 
percentage
 
points
 
off
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
direction.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
unlikely
 
outcome
 
as
 
some
 
spirits
 
will
 
be
 
overproof,
 
some
 
under.
 
This
 
improbable
 
$105,177
 
variation
 
in
 
tax
 
revenue
 
would
 
account
 
for
 
just
 
0.0023%
 
of
 
all
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
in
 
2022.
 
Against  that  $35  million  base,  a  1  percentage  point  tolerance  for  producers  with  
under
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallons
 
of
 
removal
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
maximum
 
excise
 
tax
 
revenue
 
variation
 
of
 
$350,590
 
if
 
every
 
single
 
bottle
 
were
 
fully
 
1
 
percentage
 
point
 
off
 
the
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
direction.
 
This
 
would
 
account
 
for
 
just
 
0.0075%
 
of
 
all
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
collected
 
in
 
2022.
 
 
Put  differently,  changing  the  tolerance  from  .3  percentage  points  to  1  percentage  
point
 
for
 
distilleries
 
removing
 
less
 
than
 
100,000
 
proof
 
gallons
 
from
 
bond,
 
could
 
19   
under  a  highly  improbable  set  of  circumstances  result  in  an  increase  of  potential  
distilled
 
spirits
 
excise
 
tax
 
revenue
 
variation
 
from
 
0.0023%
 
to
 
0.0075%
 
of
 
total
 
revenue.
 
ACSA
 
argues
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
significant
 
revenue
 
impact.
 
Additionally,  this  would  align  closer  with  the  reality  of  the  marketplace.  In  2018’s  
Notice
 
No.
 
176,
 
which
 
proposed
 
the
 
liberalization
 
of
 
the
 
prior
 
tolerance,
 
TTB
 
stated
 
that
 
the
 
discrepancy
 
between
 
real
 
world
 
results
 
and
 
the
 
regulation
 
drove
 
the
 
rule
 
change.
 
This
 
makes
 
sense-
 
if
 
nearly
 
¾
 
of
 
spirits
 
sampled
 
can’t
 
meet
 
a
 
rule,
 
the
 
rule
 
might
 
be
 
unrealistic.
 
And
 
that
 
was
 
indeed
 
the
 
case
 
at
 
the
 
time-
 
the
 
most
 
recently
 
published
 
TTB
 
Alcohol
 
Beverage
 
Sampling
 
Program
 
results
 
are
 
from
 
2016,
 
when
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
tolerance
 
for
 
being
 
overproof
 
and
 
a
 
.15%
 
under
 
proof
 
tolerance.
 
Under
 
those
 
tighter
 
tolerances,
 
TTB
 
found
 
73.5%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
sampled
 
in
 
2016
 
to
 
have
 
alcohol
 
content
 
out
 
of
 
tolerance.
 
In
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
more
 
recent
 
data,
 
applying
 
some
 
assumptions
 
to
 
that
 
2016
 
data
 
suggests
 
that
 
approximately
 
33%
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
were
 
likely
 
out
 
of
 
tolerance
 
with
 
the
 
current
 
.3%
 
tolerance.
 
Given
 
the
 
difficulty
 
and
 
expense
 
required
 
for
 
smaller
 
producers
 
of
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
wine,
 
and
 
spirits
 
to
 
hit
 
tight
 
tolerances,
 
and
 
the
 
growing
 
number
 
of
 
small
 
producers
 
since
 
2016,
 
it
 
seems
 
likely
 
that
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
spirits
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
today
 
are
 
out
 
of
 
compliance.
 
4.4.  Do  the  proposed  labeling  requirements  for  non-alcoholic  malt  beverages  
adequately
 
advise
 
the
 
consumer
 
that
 
the
 
products
 
contain
 
less
 
than
 
0.5
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume?
 
Should
 
non-alcoholic
 
malt
 
beverages
 
be
 
exempted
 
from
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
labeling
 
requirements?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
brewers
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
4.5.  What,  if  any,  additional  costs  or  burdens  would  requiring  numerical  alcohol  
content
 
statements
 
for
 
table
 
wines
 
impose
 
on
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
4.6.  Would  an  alternative  that  allowed  table  wines  to  indicate  alcohol  content  as  
a
 
range
 
(e.g.,
 
7–14
 
percent
 
alcohol
 
by
 
volume)
 
place
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
wineries
 
and
 
importers?
 
Would
 
this
 
approach
 
provide
 
sufficient
 
information
 
to
 
consumers?
 
 
 
Should
 
a
 
canned
 
Vodka
 
Soda
 
of
 
14%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
carry
 
the
 
same
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
as
 
a
 
7%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
Vodka
 
Soda?
 
How
 
does
 
this
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
make
 
responsible
 
drinking
 
decisions?
 
And
 
how
 
does
 
this
 
make
 
sense
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
a
 
rulemaking
 
whose
 
primary
 
purpose,
 
according
 
to
 
TTB,
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
more
 
information?
 
 
A
 
14%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol
 
serving
 
of
 
wine
 
contains
 
twice
 
the
 
alcohol
 
of
 
a
 
7%
 
Alc.
 
/
 
Vol.
 
20   
serving.  Stated  another  way,  it  contains  100%  more  alcohol.  That  7  percentage  
point
 
tolerance
 
amounts
 
to
 
a
 
100%
 
tolerance.
 
Yet
 
the
 
two
 
can
 
currently
 
be
 
labeled
 
the
 
same,
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
rulemaking
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
proposes
 
a
 
20%
 
tolerance
 
for
 
calorie
 
content
 
labeling
 
TTB
 
is
 
considering
 
extending
 
this
 
regulation
 
into
 
the
 
future.
 
This
 
pair
 
of
 
rules,
 
taken
 
together,
 
say
 
that
 
it’s
 
more
 
important
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
calories
 
you’re
 
consuming
 
than
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
alcohol
 
you’re
 
consuming.
 
That
 
is
 
completely
 
backwards.
 
 
From
 
spirit
 
producers’
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
this
 
is
 
especially
 
intolerable
 
when
 
our
 
allowable
 
tolerance
 
is
 
so
 
small,
 
and
 
when
 
a
 
looser
 
tolerance
 
for
 
small
 
distillers
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
negligible
 
impact
 
on
 
revenue
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
consumed
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
expected
 
number
 
based
 
on
 
labeled
 
alcohol
 
content.
 
5.  Placement  of  Alcohol  Content  Statements  as  Part  of  the  Alcohol  
Facts
 
Statement
 
5.1.  Would  it  be  easier  for  consumers  to  locate  alcohol  content  information  on  a  
label
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
and
 
if
 
so,
 
why?
 
 
No.
 
Consumers
 
have
 
known
 
where
 
to
 
find
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
on
 
bottles
 
for
 
years.
 
We
 
have
 
seen
 
no
 
evidence
 
that
 
consumers
 
have
 
difficulty
 
locating
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
on
 
our
 
products,
 
so
 
why
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel?
 
5.2.  Alternatively,  should  TTB  allow  alcohol  content  labeling  as  an  optional  
element
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
an
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
statement
 
is
 
required,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
include
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement.
 
5.3.  Does  the  placement  of  alcohol  content  information  affect  costs  of  
compliance
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
If
 
so,
 
how?
 
 
Yes,
 
any
 
addition
 
of
 
new
 
labeling
 
elements
 
or
 
requirement
 
that
 
existing
 
required
 
elements
 
be
 
relocated
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
additional
 
graphic
 
design
 
and
 
printing
 
fees
 
for
 
our
 
members.
 
5.4.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  alcohol  content  information  as  part  of  the  
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
affect
 
competition
 
or
 
issues
 
addressed
 
by
 
international
 
trade
 
agreements
 
or
 
international
 
standards?
 
 
Yes,
 
every
 
additional
 
regulatory
 
cost
 
or
 
burden
 
is
 
felt
 
disproportionately
 
by
 
small
 
businesses.
 
21   
6.  Mandatory  Statement  of  Alcohol  in  Fluid  Ounces  of  Pure  Alcohol  per  
Serving
 
 
6.1.  Would  including  information  about  the  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  
per
 
serving
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
improve
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
consumers
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
consumption
 
and
 
moderation
 
advice
 
provided
 
by
 
governmental
 
and
 
health
 
agencies,
 
if
 
they
 
so
 
choose?
 
 
Consumers  are  not  familiar  with  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  as  a  unit-  this  
is
 
meaningless
 
to
 
consumers.
 
6.2.  Would  requiring  information  about  the  fluid  ounces  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  
per
 
serving
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
burdens
 
for
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
importers,
 
particularly
 
for
 
small
 
businesses?
 
 
 
Every
 
regulatory
 
requirement
 
disproportionately
 
burdens
 
small
 
businesses.
 
However,
 
if
 
TTB
 
proceeds
 
by
 
requiring
 
some
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
adding
 
this
 
particular
 
piece
 
of
 
info
 
does
 
not
 
add
 
a
 
meaningful
 
burden,
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
simple
 
calculation.
 
6.3.  Is  there  a  better  way  of  presenting  the  volume  of  alcohol  content  per  
serving?
 
Specifically,
 
should
 
the
 
term
 
‘‘standard
 
drink’’
 
be
 
defined
 
and
 
used
 
in
 
place
 
of
 
or
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
pure
 
ethyl
 
alcohol
 
per
 
serving?
 
 
See
 
above-
 
if
 
TTB
 
does
 
implement
 
a
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
ACSA
 
supports
 
including
 
either
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
content
 
or
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
ounces
 
of
 
pure
 
ethyl
 
alcohol
 
per
 
serving.
 
6.4.  TTB  notes  that  the  Dietary  Guidelines  for  Americans,  2020–2025,  use  the  
terms
 
‘‘drink,’’
 
and
 
‘‘alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent,’’
 
and
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
any
 
of
 
those
 
terms
 
should
 
be
 
used
 
or
 
defined
 
for
 
use
 
on
 
labels.
 
 
 
“Alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent”
 
is
 
unnecessarily
 
garbled.
 
While
 
many
 
consumers
 
understand
 
what
 
a
 
“drink”
 
is,
 
few
 
have
 
ever
 
encountered
 
the
 
phrase
 
“alcoholic
 
drink
 
equivalent.”
 
If
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
providing
 
consumers
 
information,
 
provide
 
it
 
in
 
simple
 
terms
 
they
 
understand.
 
“Standard
 
Drink”
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
well
 
understood.
 
6.5.  Should  the  proposed  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  statement  include  a  
summary
 
of
 
the
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines’
 
advice
 
on
 
moderate
 
drinking
 
(to
 
be
 
updated
 
based
 
on
 
any
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
guidelines
 
over
 
time)?
 
TTB
 
also
 
specifically
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
these
 
proposals
 
would
 
provide
 
useful
 
information
 
to
 
consumers
 
or
 
would
 
instead
 
be
 
confusing
 
or
 
misleading,
 
and
 
whether
 
inclusion
 
of
 
these
 
elements
 
would
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
compliance
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens.
 
 
22   
 
No.
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines
 
are
 
revised
 
as
 
frequently
 
as
 
every
 
five
 
years.
 
Five
 
years
 
is
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
timeline
 
for
 
compliance
 
with
 
a
 
new
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
requirement
 
in
 
large
 
part
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
and
 
difficulty
 
associated
 
with
 
changing
 
labels.
 
Requiring
 
inclusion
 
of
 
information
 
that
 
can
 
change
 
every
 
five
 
years
 
would
 
not
 
only
 
be
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
for
 
our
 
small
 
business
 
members
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
with,
 
but
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
a
 
compliance
 
nightmare.
 
A
 
bottle
 
of
 
our
 
products
 
might
 
live
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
for
 
months
 
or
 
years
 
after
 
it
 
is
 
produced,
 
producing
 
considerable
 
opportunities
 
for
 
confusion
 
here.
 
 
7.  Statements  of  Average  Analysis  and  Serving  Facts  Statements   
7.1.  N/A  
8.  Linear  Display,  Type  Size,  and  Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  
Information
 
 
8.1.  Would  consumers  have  trouble  locating  Alcohol  Facts  information  if  that  
information
 
is
 
presented
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display?
 
 
 
No,
 
they
 
would
 
not
 
have
 
trouble
 
locating
 
this
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display.
 
While
 
smaller
 
than
 
the
 
large
 
proposed
 
panel
 
display,
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
is
 
nonetheless
 
quite
 
large.
 
Compare
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
required
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Content
 
Statement
 
under
 
current
 
regulations.
 
 
 
ACSA
 
considers
 
Alcohol
 
Content
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
single
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
for
 
consumers
 
on
 
an
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
label.
 
The
 
linear
 
display
 
example
 
for
 
a
 
50-mL
 
container
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
provided
 
by
 
TTB
 
in
 
the
 
NPRM
 
is
 
many
 
times
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
a
 
standard
 
statement
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
on
 
a
 
50-mL
 
container
 
under
 
current
 
rules.
 
If
 
consumers
 
have
 
for
 
decades
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
most
 
important
 
information
 
at
 
that
 
tiny
 
size,
 
the
 
panel
 
size
 
is
 
surely
 
large
 
enough
 
to
 
communicate
 
calorie
 
content
 
and
 
redundant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information.
 
 
ACSA
 
supports
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
option
 
to
 
include
 
any
 
additional
 
required
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning
 
statement.
 
 
Containers
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
are
 
by
 
definition
 
quite
 
a
 
manageable
 
size,
 
since
 
the
 
largest
 
possible
 
container
 
now
 
is
 
3.75L,
 
and
 
therefore
 
any
 
required
 
information
 
contained
 
on
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
labels
 
in
 
a
 
compliant
 
manner
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
too
 
difficult
 
for
 
a
 
consumer
 
to
 
find.
 
We
 
therefore
 
urge
 
TTB,
 
if
 
it
 
does
 
adopt
 
these
 
rules,
 
not
 
to
 
follow
 
in
 
FDA’s
 
footsteps
 
as
 
FDA
 
considers
 
requiring
 
nutritional
 
info
 to  be  disclosed  on  the  front  of  food  products.  See  Docket  No.  FDA-2024-N-2910.   
23   
 
If
 
in
 
enacting
 
these
 
regulations
 
TTB
 
decides
 
to
 
adhere
 
closely
 
to
 
FDA
 
nutritional
 
labeling
 
rules
 
going
 
forward,
 
and
 
TTB
 
follows
 
FDA
 
on
 
moving
 
nutritional
 
info
 
panels
 
to
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
packaging
 
some
 
years
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
this
 
change
 
would
 
even
 
further
 
burden
 
small
 
businesses
 
who
 
by
 
this
 
point
 
would
 
already
 
have
 
redesigned
 
and
 
reproduced
 
their
 
labels
 
and
 
associated
 
production
 
tooling.
 
FDA’s
 
change
 
will
 
not
 
burden
 
small
 
businesses,
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
exempt
 
from
 
its
 
nutritional
 
information
 
labeling
 
rules,
 
but
 
if
 
TTB
 
continues
 
to
 
refuse
 
to
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses,
 
this
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
concerning
 
development.
 
8.2.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  the  linear  display  to  appear  in  a  box  with  the  
title
 
‘‘Alcohol
 
Facts’’
 
in
 
bold-face
 
type
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
better
 
locate
 
the
 
information?
 
Alternatively,
 
should
 
industry
 
members
 
be
 
allowed
 
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
surrounded
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
 
Bold-face
 
type
 
and
 
a
 
box
 
are
 
not
 
necessary
 
for
 
a
 
linear
 
display.
 
Alcohol
 
content,
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
for
 
consumers
 
on
 
an
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
label,
 
has
 
for
 
decades
 
been
 
permitted
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
in
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
formats
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
it
 
meets
 
legibility
 
and
 
type
 
size
 
requirements.
 
Requiring
 
redundant
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information
 
and
 
calorie
 
counts
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
more
 
prominently
 
and
 
with
 
less
 
flexibility
 
does
 
not
 
make
 
sense.
 
8.3.  Do  consumers,  industry  members,  or  other  interested  parties  have  
comments
 
on
 
the
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
general
 
formatting
 
requirements
 
proposed
 
for
 
both
 
linear
 
displays
 
and
 
panels?
 
 
If
 
TTB
 
has
 
not
 
received
 
an
 
avalanche
 
of
 
consumer
 
comments
 
suggesting
 
that
 
current
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
rules
 
for
 
statements
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
are
 
insufficient,
 
ACSA
 
does
 
not
 
see
 
a
 
compelling
 
reason
 
for
 
this
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
to
 
have
 
any
 
additional
 
requirements.
 
The
 
current
 
rules
 
for
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
are
 
adequate
 
to
 
communicate
 
vital
 
health
 
and
 
safety
 
information
 
to
 
consumers,
 
while
 
also
 
giving
 
the
 
industry
 
latitude
 
to
 
create
 
attractive
 
and
 
original
 
label
 
designs.
 
We
 
support
 
this
 
flexible
 
yet
 
effective
 
form
 
of
 
display
 
requirements.
 
8.4.  How  would  the  proposed  formatting  requirements,  including  the  linear  
display
 
option,
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
formatting
 
requirements?
 
 
 
The
 
more
 
rigid
 
the
 
display
 
requirements,
 
the
 
more
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
the
 
regulation.
 
A
 
box
 
of
 
specific
 
sizes
 
and
 
proportions
 
is
 
more
 
difficult
 
to
 
fit
 
into
 
existing
 
label
 
artwork
 
than
 
a
 
few
 
lines
 
of
 
text.
 
Graphic
 
design
 
fees
 
are
 
extremely
 
expensive
 
to
 
our
 
small
 
businesses,
 
often
 
running
 
into
 
the
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
 
If
 
TTB
 
does
 
implement
 
a
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement,
 
ACSA
 
strongly
 
24   
urges  it  to  allow  the  statement  to  appear  in  the  widest  possible  variety  of  formats,  
with
 
the
 
most
 
flexibility
 
extended
 
to
 
small
 
producers.
 
8.5.  Should  TTB  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  mandatory  
statements
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
appear
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
For
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
should
 
TTB
 
remove
 
the
 
maximum
 
type
 
size
 
limitation
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
that
 
may
 
appear
 
elsewhere
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
well?
 
 
 
We
 
defer
 
to
 
the
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverage
 
industries
 
on
 
this
 
question.
 
8.6.  What  alternatives  exist  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers?  
How,
 
if
 
it
 
all,
 
would
 
the
 
alternatives
 
affect
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
displaying
 
the
 
information
 
as
 
proposed
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
aligning
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
 
 
ACSA
 
strongly
 
urges
 
TTB
 
to
 
consider
 
permitting
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
online
 
via
 
QR
 
code.
 
Alternatively,
 
ACSA
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
information
 
TTB
 
ultimately
 
requires
 
to
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
to
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning
 
already
 
required
 
on
 
labels.
 
 
Without
 
an
 
exemption
 
for
 
small
 
businesses,
 
alternatives
 
for
 
display
 
would
 
provide
 
the
 
best
 
effect
 
on
 
competition
 
for
 
small
 
distillers.
 
Large
 
international
 
corporations
 
that
 
dominate
 
the
 
industry
 
have
 
massive
 
budgets
 
for
 
branding
 
and
 
graphic
 
design.
 
They
 
can
 
afford
 
the
 
six-figure
 
design
 
fees
 
of
 
the
 
world’s
 
top
 
packaging
 
designers,
 
who
 
will
 
find
 
attractive
 
ways
 
to
 
fit
 
this
 
new
 
information
 
onto
 
their
 
labels.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
much
 
more
 
difficult
 
for
 
our
 
members
 
to
 
fit
 
large,
 
unsightly
 
displays
 
onto
 
our
 
packaging.
 
 
Our
 
labels
 
are
 
often
 
the
 
only
 
opportunity
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
an
 
impression
 
on
 
consumers.
 
We
 
can’t
 
afford
 
global
 
ad
 
campaigns
 
to
 
promote
 
brand
 
awareness-
 
if
 
we’re
 
lucky
 
enough
 
to
 
get
 
on
 
a
 
shelf,
 
that’s
 
often
 
the
 
only
 
place
 
a
 
consumer
 
will
 
ever
 
see
 
our
 
product
 
or
 
our
 
name.
 
If
 
new
 
requirements
 
make
 
it
 
more
 
difficult
 
for
 
our
 
products
 
to
 
look
 
attractive,
 
to
 
communicate
 
our
 
story,
 
and
 
to
 
stand
 
out,
 
that
 
will
 
become
 
even
 
harder.
 
 
More
 
compact
 
display
 
alternatives
 
not
 
only
 
provide
 
more
 
flexibility
 
within
 
existing
 
labels,
 
they
 
also
 
help
 
remove
 
the
 
unappealing
 
alternative
 
of
 
adding
 
an
 
additional
 
small
 
label.
 
Most
 
small
 
distillers
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
automated
 
labeling
 
machinery-
 
many
 
of
 
us
 
label
 
by
 
hand
 
or
 
with
 
manually
 
operated
 
machinery.
 
This
 
makes
 
packaging
 
labor
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
expensive
 
parts
 
of
 
our
 
products.
 
Adding
 
a
 
separate
 
sticker
 
just
 
for
 
this
 
information
 
would
 
add
 
considerable
 
additional
 
labor
 
cost
 
and
 
burden
 
over
 
time.
 
 
25   
The  EU,  which  generally  has  stricter  requirements  than  the  US  for  consumer  
product
 
labeling,
 
such
 
as
 
in
 
its
 
tobacco
 
products
 
regulation,
 
allows
 
nutritional
 
info
 
to
 
be
 
shared
 
by
 
QR
 
code.
 
8.7.  If  TTB  adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  for  alcohol  beverages,  
should
 
it
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
satisfying
 
the
 
requirement
 
by
 
making
 
the
 
information
 
available
 
electronically,
 
for
 
example
 
by
 
including
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
to
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
view
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
the
 
product
 
label?
 
Would
 
this
 
option
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
sufficient
 
access
 
to
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
at
 
the
 
retail
 
store
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions,
 
given
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
potential
 
issues
 
regarding
 
the
 
adequacy
 
of
 
cellular
 
or
 
Wi-Fi
 
coverage
 
at
 
some
 
retail
 
stores,
 
and
 
other
 
potential
 
technological
 
challenges?
 
Would
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
disclosures
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
create
 
disproportional
 
barriers
 
to
 
access
 
for
 
particular
 
communities?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
TTB
 
adopts
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements,
 
TTB
 
should
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
make
 
required
 
information
 
available
 
electronically.
 
This
 
would
 
not
 
create
 
a
 
meaningful
 
barrier
 
to
 
access
 
to
 
information.
 
 
According
 
to
 
Pew
 
Research,
 
in
 
2024,
 
91%
 
of
 
Americans
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone.
 
This
 
constitutes
 
a
 
ten
 
percentage
 
point
 
increase
 
from
 
five
 
years
 
earlier,
 
in
 
2019,
 
when
 
81%
 
of
 
Americans
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone.
 
Five
 
years
 
from
 
now,
 
when
 
these
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
regulations
 
would
 
be
 
implemented,
 
that
 
number
 
will
 
be
 
even
 
closer
 
to
 
100%.
 
Those
 
who
 
don’t
 
own
 
smartphones
 
are
 
disproportionately
 
those
 
not
 
yet
 
of
 
drinking
 
age,
 
who
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
of
 
concern
 
in
 
this
 
rulemaking. 
8.8.  How  would  the  option  of  disclosing  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  
information
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
disclosure
 
via
 
electronic
 
means?
 
 
 
Disclosing
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
less
 
costly
 
and
 
burdensome
 
to
 
small
 
businesses.
 
QR
 
codes
 
take
 
up
 
very
 
little
 
space
 
on
 
a
 
label
 
and
 
would
 
create
 
very
 
limited
 
additional
 
graphic
 
design,
 
printing,
 
and
 
bottling
 
labor
 
costs.
 
Adding
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
to
 
a
 
website
 
costs
 
very
 
little.
 
 
8.9.  If  TTB  were  to  allow  mandatory  information  to  be  disclosed  electronically,  
should
 
TTB
 
allow
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
electronically
 
or
 
should
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
 
 
If
 
any
 
form
 
of
 
labeling
 
is
 
mandated
 
for
 
small
 
business
 
by
 
TTB,
 
a
 
hybrid
 
digital
 
-
 
printed
 
solution
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
less
 
burdensome
 
to
 
our
 
small
 
and
 
even
 
26   
medium-sized  business  members.   
 
For
 
example,
 
requiring
 
a
 
statement
 
of
 
calories
 
that
 
follows
 
the
 
same
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
requirements
 
as
 
the
 
current
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
would
 
be
 
relatively
 
trivial,
 
even
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.
 
To
 
address
 
concerns
 
about
 
other
 
nutritional
 
info,
 
TTB
 
could
 
require
 
a
 
statement
 
to
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
“alcoholic
 
beverages
 
contain
 
no
 
nutritive
 
value”
 
to
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
Government
 
Warning.
 
Any
 
other
 
required
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
carbohydrate
 
and
 
protein
 
content,
 
could
 
be
 
made
 
available
 
online.
 
8.10.  If  TTB  allowed  multiple  options  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  
consumers,
 
could
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
uniformity
 
create
 
consumer
 
confusion?
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
note
 
that
 
FDA
 
finds
 
compelling
 
interest
 
in
 
small
 
business
 
protection
 
to
 
be
 
balanced
 
with
 
consumer
 
interests.
 
For
 
large
 
producers,
 
uniformity
 
of
 
information,
 
not
 
of
 
display,
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
believe
 
to
 
matter.
 
TTB’s
 
existing
 
rules
 
for
 
the
 
statement
 
of
 
alcohol
 
content
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
guide
 
here.
 
Alcohol
 
content
 
must
 
be
 
stated
 
as
 
a
 
percent
 
by
 
volume,
 
while
 
an
 
additional
 
statement
 
in
 
proof
 
may
 
be
 
stated,
 
but
 
the
 
specifics
 
of
 
how
 
this
 
appears
 
visually
 
are
 
quite
 
flexible.
 
This
 
provides
 
vital
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
consistent
 
format,
 
but
 
gives
 
brands
 
design
 
flexibility
 
and
 
gives
 
consumers
 
credit
 
for
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
understand
 
clearly
 
displayed
 
information.
 
9.  Serving  Size  Reference  Amounts   
9.1.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  a  reasonably  accurate  representation  
of
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
serving?
 
If
 
not,
 
what
 
data
 
or
 
other
 
information
 
should
 
TTB
 
consider
 
that
 
would
 
give
 
a
 
better
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
amount
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
product
 
category?
 
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
follow
 
CDC’s
 
definitions
 
of
 
standard
 
drinks
 
in
 
determining
 
allowable
 
serving
 
sizes,
 
but
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
understanding
 
that
 
the
 
definitions
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
standard
 
drinks
 
assume
 
an
 
alcohol
 
content
 
of
 
40%.
 
9.2.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  more  accurate  than  the  serving  sizes  
set
 
forth
 
in
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2004–1
 
(1.5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
wines,
 
and
 
12
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
regardless
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content)?
 
Why

counterproductive
 
to
 
efforts

9.3.  Should  TTB  allow  greater  flexibility  in  serving  sizes?   
 
No.
 
If
 
serving
 
sizes
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
required
 
part
 
of
 
alcoholic
 
beverage
 
labels,
 
they
 
should
 
make
 
clear
 
to
 
consumers
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
given
 
product
 
constitutes
 
a
 
standard
 
drink.
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
a
 
non-resealable
 
container
 
like
 
a
 
can,
 
communicating
 
that
 
it
 
contains
 
1.5
 
drinks
 
is
 
useful
 
information.
 
9.4.  Should  the  serving  size  reference  amounts  be  exactly  equal  to  an  alcoholic  
drink
 
equivalent
 
of
 
0.6
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
would
 
this
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
not
 
recognizing
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
typically
 
consumed?
 
 
 
If
 
communicated
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
this
 
would
 
introduce
 
confusion.
 
Consumers
 
do
 
not
 
think
 
about
 
alcohol
 
in
 
this
 
way
 
and
 
would
 
be
 
likely
 
to
 
misinterpret
 
this
 
information.
 
 
But
 
if
 
.6
 
fluid
 
oz

alcohol
 
is
 
just
 
the
 
behind-the-scenes
 
basis
 
for
 
calculating
 
the

that
 
would
 
be
 
very
 
reasonable.
 
 
10.  Dual-Column  Alcohol  Facts  Panel  Display  
10.1.  Does  dual-column  labeling  create  the  impression  that  consumption  of  
multiple
 
servings
 
of
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
at
 
one
 
time
 
is
 
expected
 
or
 
recommended?
 
 
 
No
 
more
 
so
 
than
 
it
 
does
 
for
 
food
 
products.
 
10.2.  Should  dual-column  displays  be  limited  to  containers  with  three  or  fewer  
servings,
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FDA
 
regulations?
 
Or
 
is
 
a
 
limit
 
of
 
less
 
than
 
five
 
servings
 
better
 
suited
 
to
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
may
 
be
 
bottled
 
and
 
labeled?

10.3.  Should  dual-column  displays  be  allowed  on  any  container,  regardless  of  
the
 
number
 
of
 
servings
 
in
 
that
 
container,
 
consistent
 
with
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2013–2?
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
would
 
require
 
containers
 
with
 
a
 
net
 
content
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
100
 
percent
 
but
 
less
 
than
 
200
 
percent
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
serving
 
size
 
reference
 
amount
 
to
 
be
 
labeled
 
as
 
containing
 
a
 
single
 
serving.
 
TTB
 
solicits
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
convey
 
the
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutrient
 
content
 
of
 
these
 
products
 
to
 
consumers.
 
 
We
 
see
 
no
 
reason
 
to
 
forbid
 
dual-column
 
displays
 
on
 
any
 
container.
 
If
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
panels
 
are
 
intended
 
to
 
give
 
consumers
 
easier
 
access
 
to
 
information,
 
then
 
28   
permit  those  producers  who  wish  to  provide  an  easier  way  to  understand  that  
information
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
11.  Implementation  Period   
11.1.  How  frequently  do  bottlers  and  importers  of  alcohol  beverages  typically  
change
 
labels?
 
 
The
 
only
 
accurate
 
answer
 
to
 
this
 
is
 
“it
 
depends.”
 
Printing
 
labels
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
areas
 
of
 
our
 
industry
 
that
 
is
 
most
 
affected
 
by
 
economies
 
of
 
scale.
 
The
 
unit
 
cost
 
of
 
printing
 
the
 
same
 
exact
 
label
 
might
 
go
 
from
 
ten
 
cents
 
apiece
 
for
 
an
 
order
 
of
 
tens
 
of
 
thousands
 
to
 
several
 
dollars
 
apiece
 
for
 
an
 
order
 
of
 
a
 
couple
 
hundred.
 
As
 
such,
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
order
 
large
 
quantities
 
of
 
labels
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
use
 
for
 
years
 
to
 
decrease
 
unit
 
costs.
 
But
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
members
 
might
 
print
 
smaller
 
runs
 
more
 
frequently.
 
Some
 
members
 
only
 
make
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
products
 
that
 
stay
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
years.
 
Some
 
members
 
only
 
make
 
limited
 
release
 
products
 
and
 
require
 
new
 
labels
 
many
 
times
 
a
 
year
 
for
 
each
 
new
 
product.
 
Many
 
members
 
pursue
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
the
 
above
 
strategies.
 
11.2.  How  long  do  industry  members  need  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  
the
 
proposed
 
rule?
 
 
If
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule
 
goes
 
through
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses,
 
5
 
years
 
is
 
an
 
appropriate
 
implementation
 
timeline.
 
11.3.  Will  5  years  provide  enough  time  for  small  businesses  to  coordinate  
labeling
 
changes
 
required
 
by
 
regulatory
 
changes
 
with
 
labeling
 
changes
 
that
 
are
 
planned
 
in
 
the
 
ordinary
 
course
 
of
 
business?
 
 
 
We
 
urge
 
that
 
TTB
 
exempt
 
small
 
businesses
 
from
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
Small
 
businesses
 
are
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
implement
 
changes
 
to
 
their
 
labels
 
significant
 
enough
 
to
 
require
 
new
 
graphic
 
design
 
or
 
even
 
new
 
tooling
 
every
 
5
 
years
 
since
 
the
 
expense
 
is
 
significant.
 
Usually
 
a
 
small
 
business
 
will
 
spend
 
a
 
significant
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
in
 
branding
 
and
 
design
 
once
 
every
 
10
 
years
 
for
 
its
 
most
 
popular
 
products.
 
11.4.  Is  5  years  too  long  a  compliance  period?  Should  the  compliance  period  
instead
 
be
 
2
 
years,
 
3
 
years,
 
or
 
another
 
length
 
of
 
time?
 
 
 
For
 
large
 
companies,
 
every
 
5
 
years
 
should
 
be
 
fine.
 
For
 
small
 
companies,
 
there
 
should
 
be
 
an
 
exemption
 
process
 
available
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
with
 
food
 
products.
 
11.5.  If  a  final  rule  is  issued,  will  industry  members  begin  implementation  of  the  
labeling
 
changes
 
in
 
advance
 
of
 
the
 
compliance
 
date?
 
 
Some
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
if
 
it
 
aligns
 
with
 
their
 
priorities
 
and
 
needs.

Subject: Comments on: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages  
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance , a strategic collaboration  among 
companies and with institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable development of Mezcal. Its 
purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint 
projects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  
solutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines 
Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT 
Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in 
accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical 
regulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial 
proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods 
 
Key points of the proposal: 
• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol 
content per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number 
of servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of 
alcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   
• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal 
Register is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
General comments on the proposal:  
 
Alcohol content 
It is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to 
inform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by 
the average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, 
and that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without 
requiring placement in a specific panel or format. 
 
Serving and servings per container: 
The proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container 
across all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. 
While it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in 
a standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If 
mandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), 
which would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or 
commercial burdens. 
 
Nutritional information 
 
The proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and 
proteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may 
confuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol 
 
should not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into 
viewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions 
based on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol 
consumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. 
 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? 
Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it 
unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food 
labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful 
information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by 
implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily 
nutrient requirements? 
 
We believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any 
benefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is 
to prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could 
create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among 
consumers. 
 
We consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, 
sugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier 
than other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could 
confuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium 
content, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the 
consumer's diet and are not comparable. 
 
By its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental 
information on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that 
alcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision 
and favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of 
alcohol that each product contains. 
 
Making this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which 
goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  
trade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this 
information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible 
to consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
• Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Easy updating as regulations change. 
• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of 
harmful alcohol consumption. 
• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement 
these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in 
the U.S. 
 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
 
As previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels 
could lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious 
confusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) 
shows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is 
clear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion 
or misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. 
 
 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
 
As previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers 
to believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements 
like dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not 
recommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such 
declarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. 
 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
 
Including nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly 
believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like 
dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such 
information should not be required in any form.  
 
In Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits 
or therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus 
solely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness 
benefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising 
with alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising 
Regulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. 
These declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health 
messaging. 
 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health 
benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations 
on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
 
 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
 
 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity 
and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts 
labeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with 
such revisions? 
 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" 
panel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and 
regulatory burdens. 
 
 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
  
Making a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, 
this proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be 
more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -
fulfilment would create”. 
 
8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in 
particular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially 
small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging 
and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. 
This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
 
To reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is 
recommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements 
internationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Detailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health 
benefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid 
regulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers.

WIRSPA Submission to the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
Regarding: TTB Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  and TTB Notice No. 238 – Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
1. Introduction 
The West Indies Rum & Spirits Producers’ Association (WIRSPA) represents producers 
and brand owners of Authentic Caribbean Rum and other spirits across 15 countries. Our 
members are long -established exporters to the United States, with many products 
benefiting from recognition under the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative. The rum industry is 
a major economic driver and an important part of the cultural heritage of the Caribbean, 
supporting thousands of jobs in both production and tourism.   We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on TTB’s proposed rulemaking under Notice No. 237 and Notice 
No. 238. WIRSPA supports the goal of providing consumers with accurate, clear, and 
accessible information. However, we believe that the proposed approach requires 
adjustments to ensure that it is: 
→ Meaningful for consumers  — avoiding duplication, overly technical terms, or 
misleading nutritional framing. 
→ Flexible for producers  — recognising varied product types, serving traditions, and 
container sizes. 
→ Aligned internationally — to minimise trade barriers and regulatory divergence with 
other major markets. 
→ Practical and proportionate  — limiting compliance burdens, especially for small 
producers, and avoiding unnecessary label changes. 
Key Requests at a Glance: 
1. Change the panel title from “Alcohol Facts” to “Serving Facts”. 
2. Permit digital labeling (QR codes) to provide full information, with minimal mandatory 
on-pack content. 
3. Remove “pure alcohol in fluid ounces” and keep ABV optional in the panel. 
4. Omit irrelevant nutrients. 
5. Adapt serving sizes to reflect real-world consumption; allow justified deviations. 
6. Allow flexible formatting, including linear formats without boxed borders. 
7. Maintain ±20% tolerance and avoid unnecessary COLA resubmissions. 2 
 
8. Support 5-year transition with stock sell -through and alignment with allergen labeling 
timelines. 
9. Confirm no allergen labeling for pre -distillation ingredients, with case -by-case post-
distillation checks. 
2. Title of the Statement 
The proposed title “Alcohol Facts” risks misleading consumers into thinking that the 
panel offers a safety or health advisory, rather than factual serving information. It also 
differs from established voluntary practice and international norms. 
Argument: 
 “Serving Facts” is a more neutral, accurate descriptor. 
 The EU and many global producers already use “Serving Facts” or similar. 
 A consistent title fosters consumer understanding across markets. 
Conclusion / Ask: Replace “Alcohol Facts” with “Serving Facts” in all references and 
label examples. 
3. Digital Labeling (QR Codes and Online Access) 
The proposed rule requires all information to appear physically on the label, which can 
be restrictive for small containers, multilingual products, and brands selling in multiple 
markets. 
Argument: 
 Codex Guidelines (CXG 105 -2024) support the use of technology to deliver food and 
beverage information. 
 The EU already allows energy content on-pack with full nutrition information online . 
The Spirits Europe and DISCUS submission s both provide extensive background to 
justify this position. 
 Digital labeling reduces costs, supports sustainability, and avoids frequent reprints. 
 QR codes can provide richer, multilingual, and updated content. 
Conclusion / Ask: Allow mandatory particulars to be provided digitally via QR codes, with 
only essential on-label data required in physical print. 
4. Content of the Statement 
Several proposed elements are either duplicative or not relevant to distilled spirits. 
Argument: 
 ABV — already required elsewhere on the label; repeating it is redundant. 
 Fluid ounces of pure alcohol — unfamiliar to U.S. consumers and rarely used 
internationally. 
 Protein and fat — always negligible in distilled spirits; inclusion implies nutritional 
benefit. 3 
 
 Avoid adopting FDA -style nutrient label format –adopting FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” 
style could mislead consumers into thinking alcohol has health or nutritional benefits. 
Conclusion / Ask: Keep ABV optional in the panel; remove pure alcohol in fluid ounces; 
omit protein and fat unless above de minimis levels. 
5. Serving Sizes and Real-World Consumption 
The fixed ABV -based serving size table does not reflect actual consumption for many 
spirits categories. 
Argument: 
 Low-ABV liqueurs are often used in cocktails in portions smaller than proposed 
reference sizes. 
 High ABV spirits may be dispensed in smaller measures either on their own or as 
cocktail components, which is increasingly popular. 
 RTDs and high-ABV beers/ciders are often sold and consumed in containers larger 
than the proposed serving size. 
 FDA’s RACC methodology better matches consumer expectations. 
Conclusion / Ask: Greater flexibility on serving sizes – Allow sizes to reflect actual 
consumption patterns, product type, ABV, and category norms, rather than fixed ABV -
based thresholds. 
6. Format and Presentation 
The proposed boxed, prescriptive panel format is not always feasible, especially for small 
bottles or multi-market labels. Most spirits have applied label s which constrain the use 
of additional printed information. 
Argument: 
 Linear formats without a box can be clearer and more space efficient. 
 Excess formatting rules can create conflicts with other jurisdictions. 
Conclusion / Ask: Allow linear formats without boxed borders; permit integration with 
existing branding. 
7. Tolerances and Compliance 
Nutrient and alcohol content can vary slightly between production runs. 
Argument: 
 ±20% tolerance is reasonable and aligns with other jurisdictions. 
 Exempting minor 'Serving Facts' updates from COLA resubmission reduces burdens. 
Conclusion / Ask: Retain ±20% tolerance; avoid mandatory COLA resubmission for minor 
factual updates. 4 
 
8. Implementation Timeline and Stock Sell-Through 
Label changes are costly and time -consuming, especially for small -volume, long-shelf-
life products. 
Argument: 
 A 5-year transition is proportionate. 
 Stock sell-through avoids waste. 
 Coordinating allergen and nutrition changes reduces costs. 
Conclusion / Ask: Retain 5 -year transition; allow sell -through; align implementation 
dates for Notices 237 and 238. 
9. Allergen Labeling 
The proposed allergen labeling could unintentionally apply to ingredients used before 
distillation. 
Argument: 
 Scientific consensus supports exemption for allergens removed by distillation. 
 Many jurisdictions already exempt such cases. 
Conclusion / Ask: Confirm no allergen labeling for pre-distillation ingredients; apply case-
by-case checks for post-distillation additions. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to make a comment on these two important issues.

Red Stripe, pertaining to the US TTB Alcohol Facts Statements Proposed Rule: 
 
1. Support for Consumer Transparency and Public Health 
  
We support the intent of the proposed rule to provide consumers with clear, consistent, and 
accessible information regarding alcohol content, calories, and macronutrients. This aligns 
with public health goals and empowers consumers to make informed decisions. 
However, we urge TTB to ensure that the implementation of these requirements does not 
disproportionately burden small producers or create unintended barriers to market entry. 
  
2. Concerns Regarding Cost and Burden on Small Businesses 
While the proposed five-year compliance period is appreciated, we remain concerned about 
the cumulative costs of: 
• Label redesign and printing 
• Laboratory testing for nutrient content 
• Regulatory compliance and recordkeeping 
  
We recommend that TTB consider the following mitigations: 
• Providing a simplified compliance pathway for small producers, such as a tiered 
implementation schedule or reduced testing requirements. 
  
3. Flexibility in Label Format and Placement 
We support the proposed flexibility in allowing either panel or linear formats for the Alcohol 
Facts statement. This is particularly important for smaller containers and products with limited 
label space. 
We also support the removal of maximum type size restrictions and the allowance of dual-
column formats for multi-serving containers. 
  
4. Electronic Disclosure Options 
While we understand TTB’s concern about accessibility, we encourage the Bureau to 
reconsider allowing QR codes or web links as a supplemental—not exclusive—means of 
disclosure. This could reduce label clutter and allow for multilingual or dynamic content, 
especially for export markets. This is even more relevant in 2025 where in the USA nearly 90 % 
of the population owns a smartphone. 
  
5. Harmonization with FDA and International Standards 
We encourage TTB to continue aligning its labeling requirements with those of the FDA and 
international standards where feasible. This will reduce compliance complexity for producers 
operating across regulatory jurisdictions. 
  
6. Clarification on Alcohol Content Tolerances 
We support the proposed tolerances for alcohol content and nutrient declarations. However, 
we request clarification on how TTB will enforce these tolerances and whether periodic testing 
will be required post-implementation. 
  7. Implementation Timeline and COLA Flexibility 
  
We support the proposed five-year implementation period and the provision that new COLA 
applications will not be required solely for the addition of Alcohol Facts statements. This will 
significantly reduce administrative burden. 
  
8. Contrasting Label Background 
  
Additionally, please note that Red Stripe already discloses alcohol, calorie, and nutrient 
content on our labels in a clear and legible format, the introduction of a mandated contrasting 
background, without specific visual guidelines, poses practical concerns: 
• It could necessitate a complete redesign of label layouts across multiple SKUs, 
potentially impacting brand equity and incurring significant reprinting and compliance 
costs. 
• Without a clear and standardized definition of what qualifies as “contrasting,” there is a 
risk of inconsistent enforcement or rejection at port, which could disrupt exports. 
 
We would therefore recommend that TTB: 
• Provide clear design guidance or acceptable examples of compliant contrasting label 
background formats; 
• Allow some discretion in label design to preserve brand identity while meeting 
transparency objectives. 
  
Conclusion 
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking. We believe that with 
thoughtful adjustments, the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements can achieve their 
intended public health goals while minimizing undue burden on industry stakeholders.

Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages; and Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director, 
 
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide comments to The 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding  Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notice 
No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits. 
 
The SWA is the Scotch Whisky industry ’s trade association . We have over 90 member 
companies, from multinational spirits producers through to small family -run distillers, bottlers, 
blenders, and brand owners. Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky 
industry by production.  
 
Any rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the 
Scotch Whisky’s biggest market by value, with exports worth £971 million in 2024. In addition, 
many of our larger members are also investors in the United States. 
 
We fully support TTB's efforts to ensure that consumers have the relevant product information to 
make informed decisions. Our members have been doing this domestically and in their export 
markets, and consumers are already familiar with this practice. We w ould therefore like to 
submit specific comments below for your consideration on behalf of the Scotch Whisky industry. 
 
I. Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Additional on -product labelling requirements present numerous disadvantages both to 
consumers and businesses, particularly SMEs. Distilled spirits are one of the most highly 
regulated products in the United States, subject to rigorous pre -approval processes for labels 
and formulas. Despite this, the industry has proactively developed and implemented various 
self-regulatory initiatives to provide consumers with additional non -mandatory product 
information, exceeding TTB guidelines. For example, many distille rs already disclose allergen 
details and “Serving Facts” statements either on labels, websites, or via QR codes, 
SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237

demonstrating the industry’s leadership in enhancing product transparency. Companies using 
digital labelling in international markets have reported clear benefits.  
 
Voluntary information currently provided by our industry is displayed through a host of different 
means and formats . Specifying mandatory labelling requirements will  therefore inevitably cost 
every spirit producer, as they will be required to incur some form of label redesign and printing 
costs, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of product information.  The SWA 
therefore recommends retaining the voluntary approach to additional product information. 
However, should the TTB pursue a mandato ry regime, we recommend the following 
considerations be taken into account. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as 
flexible as possible, and do not result in unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while 
improving information to consumers. 
 
Product Information Statement: Serving Facts v. Alcohol Facts 
 
We recommend that the title of the alcohol beverages information statement be “Serving Facts” 
instead of “Alcohol Facts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the 
nutritional information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverag e. “Alcohol Facts” could 
confuse consumers as it may suggest that the statement includes general indications on the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages. In addition, consumers are accustomed to finding 
nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement because most operators who currently 
voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the title. Changing the labels of 
alcoholic beverages would generate additional costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors, negatively affecting an industry that already works well in disclosing information 
effectively. 
 
Display of the Product Information Statement: Digital labelling benefits  
 
We continue to recommend that “Serving Facts” information be allowed to be provided through 
digital labelling, particularly via digital QR codes. Spirits labels are already required to include a 
great deal of information in the same field of vision. Numero us studies have concluded that the 
more health information a physical label has, the less attention the consumer pays to that 
information. To avoid over-crowding labels, and consequently confusing consumers, any newly 
required information should be allowed to be provided through a website or QR code.  
 
While some consumer organisations oppose digital labelling on the grounds that it places the 
burden on consumers and puts them at a disadvantage , there are no significant studies that 
support this argument.  Digital labelling is not prohibitive for consumers considering that over 
90% of adult Americans own a smartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet.1 Notably, 
mobile phone ownership amongst senior citizens has been found to be as high as 94%, with 76% 
owning smartphones.2 The three largest phone carriers in the US currently each claim that their 
4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the US population, so consumers in both urban and 
rural areas should have access to the necessary coverage to access online information  in retail 
settings. Furthermore, digital labels can assist with accessibility requirements, facilitating 
product information in multiple languages and allowing auditory text -to-speech access on 
devices.

Some research suggests that gender, age, education and socioeconomic status might not have 
significant influence on intention to purchase product with a QR code applied to it.  Additionally, 
the presence of QR codes on products correlates to increased consumer comprehension and 
confidence about the product they are buying. It was likened to being in a traditional market, 
where one can speak to a vendor; a QR code allows the consu mer to find out much more than 
they would normally be able to do in a supermarket. QR codes also reduce the chances of there 
being multiple labels in market for the same brand as it goes through reformulation. This assists 
with avoiding consumer confusion when they encounter brand labels with different values side 
by side. Consumers are more trusting of digital label claims, in particular about the traceability 
of ingredients and components, manufacturing processes and environmental claims.3 
 
Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and user -friendly 
feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a smart phone 
or other electronic device. Digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: 
• Reduction of Costs for SMEs:  Digital labelling allows for quick adaptation to new legal 
requirements without having to design and print new labels. All companies, but 
especially SMEs, will reduce labelling costs and will have the opportunity to explore new 
export markets around the w orld, including the US. This will benefit foreign companies, 
but also US distillers, who will be able to use labels that are commonly used 
internationally with only additional information to be modified online. 
• Sustainability: digital labelling is beneficial for environmental protection, as  it reduces 
waste and costs associated with changes to traditional physical labels.  Many sectors 
(including the Scotch Whisky industry) are committed to sustainable packaging 
practices, of which labels are an essential part. The destruction of labels that are 
commonly used in the US market and the process of printing new la bels, with the 
significant amount of energy involved, will have a major environmental impact. This could 
be a recurring issue every time labelling regulations are updated. However, by using 
digital labelling businesses can reduce waste, conserve resources, and positively impact 
the environment. 
• Geo-specific information:  Recycling information and other sustainability -related 
information which are location -specific can easily be integrated into digital labels. One 
such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling information for glass 
bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels 
since last year.  
 
Digital labels have been broadly implemented as a solution to provide access to product 
information for consumers across Europe, and we believe this could be replicated for US 
consumers. The future of food and beverage labelling is digital. The use of this innovative 
measure is transformative and beneficial for the US market, where almost 97% of the population 
owns a mobile phone. Future trends predict that the number of American smartphone users 
will increase to more than 364 million people by 2040 4. Digital labelling would be more 
effective in enabling consumers to make informed choices about their health, dietary 
restrictions, and the environmental impact of their consumption.

In the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical 
label, we kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by 
a box. The space available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would 
unnecessarily take up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in 
bold type is sufficient to allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label.  
Furthermore, we request that TTB, at minimum, consider allowing producers to list only nutrients 
present in the product instead of having to print the entire statement with multiple zeros.  
We would like to stress that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement, technical 
regulations shall not be prepared, adopted, or applied with the purpose or effect of creating 
unnecessary obstacles to international trade to fulfill the legitimate objectives of member states. 
Content of Product Information Statement 
 
Distilled spirits are not significant sources of nutritional value for consumers. Scotch Whisky, 
under UK regulation, can only be produced in Scotland from cereals, water and yeast, with no 
flavourings or sweeteners. Because of the stringently regulated di stillation process, Scotch 
Whisky spirits do not contain carbohydrates, fat, or protein. Requiring extensive nutritional 
information on labels, especially when most of the nutritional facts are not applicable to distilled 
spirits, risks confusing consumers into the belief that they have a ""nutritional benefit” and that 
some alcoholic beverages are more nutritious than others. This is especially so if the statement 
contains additional information such as protein, vitamins and minerals, sodium, and further 
breakdown of fats, as considered in Notice No. 237.  
TTB asked for views on greater harmonization with the Food and Drug Administration’s  (FDA) 
nutrient content statements. We believe this would be unnecessary and misleading for the same 
reasons outlined above. No other country requires daily value information for listed nutrients on 
distilled spirits labels, as it would deviate from common global practices . It is well -understood 
that the consumption of spirits  provide no significant nutritional value and is not part of a 
consumer’s daily dietary needs. Furthermore, the adoption of FDA nutrition facts levels on spirits 
would also impose significant costs and burdens to our industry. 
The SWA therefore recommends that any nutritional information required to be provided under 
the “Serving Facts” be limited in scope and accessible via QR code. If the TTB adopts the 
requirement for a “Serving Facts” statement, the SWA would also recommend the following: 
• We welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations.  It 
would be beneficial for TTB to explicitly recognise that producers can continue to rely on 
databases and calculators to provide nutrient content information without having to 
undertake costly and burdensome laboratory testing on each of their products, 
particularly for brand extensions that might have variation in ABV from bottle to bottle, 
such as cask-strength whiskies. 
• The “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the alcohol content 
statement. For distilled spirits, the ABV is already required to appear in the same field of 
vision as the brand name and the class designation. Consumers are accustomed to  
finding this information on the main/front label. Particularly in the case of physical labels, 
space is limited and including it to the “Serving Facts” would not add any value.  
• We kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the 
“Serving Facts” statement optional. Providing this information without context would not 
necessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pur e 
alcohol is not well understood. The presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the 
provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237  
 
5 
 
drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary Guidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a 
physical label. 
• We would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes , which can 
vary from country to country depending on the ABV of the product. For instance, Scotch 
Whisky has a wide variety of products, some of which go beyond 40% ABV and for which 
the serving size would differ. Furthermore, r igid one-size-fits-all serving size 
requirements based on ABV could lead to several unintended consequences.  This 
includes consumers incorrectly conflat ing “serving size” with recommended 
consumption amount, the latter of which may drastically differ depending on the brand 
and ABV. This is especially so when the spirit is consumed as part of a mixed drink. Rigid 
serving sizes may undermine brand integrity and inadvertently encourage higher alcohol 
and calorie consumption. For these reasons, we recommend TTB’s proposed serving size 
guidelines remain optional, while permitting customized serving sizes where justified by 
product type and consumption patterns. 
• We welcome the fact that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA applications 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the “Serving 
Facts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the 
inclusion or al teration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” 
statement in this manner. 
 
Compliance Period, Stock Exhaustion, Alignment with TTB Notice No. 238  
 
In the event the proposed rulemaking contained in Notice No. 237 is adopted, the SWA endorses 
the proposed transition period of 5 years. Any shorter period for compliance would present 
difficulties for our members given our sector’s current economic climate. 
Furthermore, we would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock 
which was put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of 
our products can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. 
Finally, we further recommend that its implementation is aligned with that of Notice No. 238 on 
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, along with any other 
ingredient labeling proposal TTB might be considering . This would allow businesses to comply 
with all labelling requirements within similar implementation periods.  
In conclusion, the Scotch Whisky industry remains firmly committed to ensuring consumers 
have access to clear and relevant product information. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to 
carefully assess the potential impact of any new requirements —both to a void placing undue 
burdens on businesses, particularly SMEs, and to prevent consumer confusion regarding the 
nature of our products. 
 
Yours sincerely,

Comment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
The undersigned organizations call on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to finalize 
the proposed rule mandating on-package labeling of alcohol content and nutritional information. These 
rules will be a step forward, as current alcohol labels do not provide the information that consumers need 
to make informed purchasing and consumption decisions. 
 
The “Alcohol Facts” panel set forth by the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of 
calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”
1  
While this information represents a major step forward, the rule could be strengthened by additionally 
requiring sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in milligrams, percent 
Daily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, number of standard drinks per container, the 
conversion between standard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and the 2020-2025 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans moderate drinking advice. The final rule should also make dual-column 
labeling mandatory. 
This additional information is important as part of a commonsense approach to promoting transparency, 
health, and safety for those who consume alcohol. Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various 
harms including motor vehicle accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.2 
Alcoholic beverages may also contribute to other forms of diet-related chronic disease as alcohol is 
calorie-dense and on average accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.3 Many alcoholic 
beverages also contain carbohydrates, added sugars, and other nutrients to limit. Alcohol content labeling 
is a straightforward approach that increases consumer awareness of the contents of alcoholic beverages 
through greater transparency.4 
 
Consumers desire this information and would use it to make decisions about alcohol consumption and 
purchasing. In a March 2024 poll of 1,509 adults who drink alcohol (commissioned by CSPI and 
conducted by Big Village), strong majorities (78-90%) said alcohol content, calorie content, and 
nutritional content, would be at least somewhat important for their alcohol purchasing decisions.
5 
 
We agree with the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on-
package and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this would 
specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology 
(including those who are older or living rurally). 
 
We urge TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts rule to ensure 
that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. To ensure timely 
consumer access to this important information, the final rule should adopt a shorter compliance period of 
3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed.

We
 
respectfully
 
submit
 
the
 
following
 
comments
 
on
 
TTB
 
Notice
 
237:
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
  Background   On  January  17,  2025   TTB  published  Notice  237:  Alcohol  Facts  Statements  in  the  Labeling  of  
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
18
 
years
 
since
 
TTB
 
last
 
proposed
 
substantive
 
changes
 
to
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labeling,
 
including
 
serving
 
facts
 
and
 
nutrition
 
information.
 
On  July  31,  2007,  TTB  published  Notice  No.  73,  a  proposed  rule  entitled  “Labeling  and  
Advertising
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages”.
 
In
 
that
 
document,
 
TTB
 
proposed
 
to
 
amend
 
the
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
to
 
set
 
forth
 
requirements
 
for
 
mandatory
 
alcohol
 
content
 
labeling
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
presentation
 
of
 
certain
 
calorie
 
and
 
nutrient
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
mandatory
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
panel.
 
The
 
proposed
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
panel
 
would
 
also
 
have
 
included
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
servings
 
per
 
container
 
and
 
the
 
serving
 
size.
 
TTB
 
did
 
not
 
finalize
 
the
 
rulemaking;
 
however,
 
on
 
May
 
28,
 
2013,
 
TTB
 
published
 
TTB
 
Ruling
 
2013-2,
 
Voluntary
 
Nutrient
 
Content
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
and
 
Advertising
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
The
 
ruling
 
announced
 
that
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels
 
could
 
include
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
a
 
voluntary
 
basis
 
while
 
the
 
Bureau
 
continued
 
to
 
consider
 
the
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
TTB
 
withdrew
 
the
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
rulemaking
 
from
 
the
 
Unified
 
Agenda
 
of
 
Federal
 
Regulatory
 
and
 
Deregulatory
 
Actions
 
in
 
the
 
fall
 
of
 
2017.
 
In  the  intervening  years,  the  TTB  has  received  letters  from  various  groups  to  revisit  the  potential  
for
 
changes
 
to
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labels.
 
Additionally,
 
in
 
2022
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury
 
issued
 
a
 
report,
 
“Competition
 
in
 
the
 
Markets
 
for
 
Beer,
 
Wine,
 
and
 
Spirits.”
 
The
 
competition
 
report
 
recommended
 
that
 
TTB
 
should
 
revive
 
or
 
initiate
 
rulemaking
 
proposing
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
and
 
mandatory  information  on  alcohol  content,  nutritional  content,  and  appropriate  serving  sizes.  
Consistent
 
with
 
that
 
recommendation,
 
TTB
 
published
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232,
 
which
 
announced
 
two
 
virtual
 
listening
 
sessions,
 
on
 
February
 
28
 
and
 
29,
 
2024,
 
and
 
the
 
opening
 
of
 
a
 
docket
 
to
 
receive
 
public
 
input
 
on
 
labeling
 
of
 
wine,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
with
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutritional
 
information,
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
and/or
 
ingredients.
 
TTB
 
received
 
over
 
5,000
 
written
 
comments
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232
 
and
 
heard
 
from
 
47
 
speakers
 
during
 
the
 
listening
 
sessions.
 
TTB  is  now  publishing  for  public  comment  a  new  proposal  that  would  require  “Alcohol  Facts”  
labeling
 
for
 
wines,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
provides
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutritional
 
information,
 
per
 
serving,
 
for
 
these
 
products
 
on
 
labels.
 
TTB
 
is
 
addressing
 
the
 
Competition
 
Report's
 
recommendations
 
and
 
Notice
 
No.
 
232
 
comments
 
from
 
the
 
listening
 
sessions
 
on
 
mandatory
 
allergen
 
and
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
in
 
separate
 
rulemaking
 
projects.
 
Title  of  the  Alcohol  Beverage  Statement  
TTB  is  proposing  “Alcohol  Facts”  as  the  title  of  the  informational  statement,  instead  of  “Serving  
Facts,”
 
which
 
was
 
proposed
 
in
 
2007.
 
WineAmerica
 
does
 
not
 
support
 
this
 
change
 
as
 
it
 
would
 
create
 
confusion
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
have
 
grown
 
accustomed
 
to
 
the
 
existing
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statement
 
on
 
beverage
 
alcohol
 
labels.
  
We
 
will
 
now
 
address
 
TTB’s
 
specific
 
questions:
 
1.  Which  title,  “Serving  Facts”  or  “Alcohol  Facts,”  would  be  more  informative  to  consumers?  
Does
 
the
 
title
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
better
 
describe
 
the
 
information
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
statement,
 
which
 
includes
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
content
 
information?
 
The  title  of  “Serving  Facts”  will  be  more  informative  to  consumers.  The  consumer  is  already  
accustomed
 
to
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
disclosure
 
to
 
inform
 
how
 
much
 
alcohol
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
labeled
 
product.
 
Creating
 
an
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
disclosure
 
will
 
only
 
confuse
 
the
 
consumer.
 
2.  Would  the  use  of  the  title  “Alcohol  Facts”  affect  compliance  costs  or  regulatory  burdens  by  
requiring
 
a
 
title
 
change
 
for
 
products
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
labeled
 
with
 
a
 
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
statement?
 
Yes,  the  producers  who  are  already  voluntarily  disclosing  serving  facts  and  nutrition  information  
will
 
need
 
to
 
redo
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
existing
 
labels
 
at
 
significant
 
cost.
 
 
3.  Are  consumers  accustomed  to  finding  nutrient  content  information  in  a  Serving  Facts  
statement?
 
Would
 
changing
 
the
 
title
 
to
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
cause
 
confusion?
 
Yes,  as  described  above,  the  consumer  already  knows  to  look  for  the  alcohol  content  statement,  
and
 
the
 
serving
 
facts
 
should
 
remain
 
separate
 
from
 
that.
 
4.  Alternatively,  does  the  title  “Alcohol  Facts”  make  it  easier  for  consumers  to  readily  
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items?
 
That  is  unknown,  as  it  does  not  currently  exist  in  any  form.  Alcohol  consumers  already  are  able  
to
 
distinguish
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
from
 
other
 
food
 
items
 
through
 
the
 
Government
 
Warning
 
statement
 
and
 
alcohol
 
disclosure,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
on
 
other
 
food
 
items.
 Linear  Display,  Type  Size,  and  Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  Information  
Linear  Display  
TTB  proposes  to  allow  the  option  of  a  linear  display  placed  on  the  container  (including  a  keg),  as  
long
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
set
 
apart
 
from
 
other
 
information
 
and
 
is
 
placed
 
inside
 
a
 
box
 
with
 
the
 
title
 
“Alcohol
 
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-faced
 
type.
 
WineAmerica  supports  the  option  of  a  linear  display  placed  on  a  container  with  the  moniker  
“Serving
 
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-faced
 
type,
 
separate
 
and
 
apart
 
from
 
the
 
existing
 
alcohol
 
content
 
disclosure.
 
We
 
agree
 
with
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
premise
 
that
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
will
 
allow
 
information
 
to
 
fit
 
on
 
labels
 
of
 
most
 
containers
 
without
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
back
 
label,
 
while
 
requiring
 
the
 
linear
 
display
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
box
 
will
 
make
 
it
 
more
 
noticeable
 
to
 
consumers.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
should
 
only
 
be
 
one
 
option
 
for
 
disclosure.
 
Type  Size  
TTB  is  proposing  that  the  minimum  type  size  requirements  for  Alcohol  Facts  statements  mirror  
existing
 
type
 
size
 
requirements
 
for
 
mandatory
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
wine,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverage
 
regulations
 
in
 
parts
 
4,
 
5,
 
and
 
7,
 
respectively.
 
 
WineAmerica  agrees  with  TTB  for  on  label  disclosure,  if  the  producer  so  chooses  to  disclose  
their
 
serving
 
facts
 
information
 
on
 
label.
 
Electronic  Display  of  Alcohol  Facts  Information  
TTB  considered,  but  is  not  proposing,  to  allow  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  panel  to  be  
distributed
 
by
 
electronic
 
means
 
via
 
a
 
link,
 
code,
 
or
 
other
 
marking
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
rather
 
than
 
requiring
 
the
 
full
 
panel
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
itself.
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
allowing
 
mandatory
 
information
 
to
 
appear
 
somewhere
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
would
 
decrease
 
consumer
 
accessibility
 
to
 
information
 
that
 
informs
 
decisions
 
about
 
purchasing
 
and
 
consuming
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.
 
WineAmerica  strongly  supports  the  disclosure  of  Serving  Facts  via  electronic  means.  The  
European
 
Union
 
has
 
already
 
allowed
 
for
 
this
 
and
 
it
 
makes
 
logical
 
sense
 
for
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
to
 
follow
 
suit.
 
TTB
 
notes
 
that
 
industry
 
comments
 
in
 
the
 
2024
 
Listening
 
Sessions
 
reflected
 
this
 
by
 
outlining
 
our
 
argument
 
as
 
such:
 
1.  Web-based  disclosure  is  a  cost-efficient  means  to  provide  information  to  consumers  that  
provides
 
producers
 
with
 
flexibility
 
and
 
reduces
 
time
 
to
 
market.
 
If
 
a
 
consumer
 
wishes
 
to
 
access
 
the
 
information
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
without
 
creating
 
significant
 
financial
 
burden
 
to
 
the
 
producer.
 
2.  The  EU  has  already  implemented  this  system.  It  benefits  producers  to  not  have  to  
produce
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
label
 
for
 
the
 
products
 
sold
 
in
 
different
 
markets.
 
Additionally,
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
allows
 
for
 
easier
 
tailoring
 
of
 
specific
 
information
 
to
 
different
 
markets
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
print
 
various
 
different
 
labels.
 3.  Web-based  disclosure  is  more  consumer  friendly.  For  example,  a  QR  code  can  prevent  
labels
 
from
 
becoming
 
cluttered,
 
which
 
can
 
ultimately
 
be
 
distracting
 
for
 
the
 
consumer.
 
We  will  now  address  TTB’s  specific  questions:  
1.  Would  consumers  have  trouble  locating  Alcohol  Facts  information  if  that  information  is  
presented
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
display?
 
Consumers  would  not  have  trouble  locating  Serving  Facts  information  presented  in  a  linear  
display.
 
2.  Does  the  proposal  to  require  the  linear  display  to  appear  in  a  box  with  the  title  “Alcohol  
Facts”
 
in
 
bold-face
 
type
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
better
 
locate
 
the
 
information?
 
Alternatively,
 
should
 
industry
 
members
 
be
 
allowed
 
the
 
flexibility
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
linear
 
display
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
surrounded
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
A  box  should  not  be  required.  The  title  should  not  be  labeled  as  “Alcohol  Facts”  but  as  “Serving  
Facts”.
 
3.  Do  consumers,  industry  members,  or  other  interested  parties  have  comments  on  the  type  size  
and
 
general
 
formatting
 
requirements
 
proposed
 
for
 
both
 
linear
 
displays
 
and
 
panels?
 
WineAmerica  supports  minimum  type  size  requirements  for  an  “on  label”  disclosure  option.  
4.  How  would  the  proposed  formatting  requirements,  including  the  linear  display  option,  affect  
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
formatting
 
requirements?
 
Any  on-label  disclosure  will  increase  costs  for  producers.  Additionally,  there  is  limited  space  on  
a
 
label.
 
This
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
clutter
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
and
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
Thus,
 
an
 
“off-label”
 
solution
 
is
 
preferred
 
to
 
reduce
 
costs
 
and
 
regulatory
 
burdens.
 
5.  Should  TTB  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  mandatory  statements  of  alcohol  
content
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages
 
that
 
appear
 
in
 
an
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement?
 
For
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
should
 
TTB
 
remove
 
the
 
maximum
 
type
 
size
 
limitation
 
for
 
alcohol
 
content
 
statements
 
that
 
may
 
appear
 
elsewhere
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
well?
 
The  TTB  should  remove  the  maximum  type  size  limitation  for  any  serving  facts  disclosure  
6.  What  alternatives  exist  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers?  How,  if  it  all,  
would
 
the
 
alternatives
 
affect
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
displaying
 
the
 
information
 
as
 
proposed
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
aligning
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries?
 
There  should  be  an  “off-label”  option  for  disclosing  Serving  Facts.  This  will  allow  for  less  clutter  
on
 
the
 
product
 
label
 
and
 
avoid
 
confusion
 
among
 
consumers.
 
WineAmerica
 
does
 
not
 
believe
 
it
 
will
 
impact
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace.
 
The
 
main
 
benefit
 
for
 
aligning
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
information
 
with
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
other
 
countries
 
will
 
allow
 
producers
 
to
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
spend
 money  and  resources  creating  various  different  labels  for  various  different  markets.  A  web  based  
solution
 
allows
 
for
 
a
 
quick
 
ability
 
to
 
change
 
any
 
requirements
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
market.
 
7.  If  TTB  adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  for  alcohol  beverages,  should  it  include  the  
option
 
of
 
satisfying
 
the
 
requirement
 
by
 
making
 
the
 
information
 
available
 
electronically,
 
for
 
example
 
by
 
including
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
to
 
allow
 
consumers
 
to
 
view
 
mandatory
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statements
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
the
 
product
 
label?
 
Would
 
this
 
option
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
sufficient
 
access
 
to
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
at
 
the
 
retail
 
store
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions,
 
given
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
potential
 
issues
 
regarding
 
the
 
adequacy
 
of
 
cellular
 
or
 
Wi-Fi
 
coverage
 
at
 
some
 
retail
 
stores,
 
and
 
other
 
potential
 
technological
 
challenges?
 
Would
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
disclosures
 
via
 
electronic
 
means
 
create
 
disproportional
 
barriers
 
to
 
access
 
for
 
particular
 
communities?
 
TTB  should  allow  for  electronic  disclosure  of  Serving  Facts  labeling.  This  would  allow  for  the  
consumers
 
that
 
wish
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
information
 
readily
 
available
 
to
 
them,
 
and
 
allow
 
for
 
producers
 
to
 
have
 
flexibility
 
to
 
disclose
 
either
 
on
 
label
 
or
 
off
 
label.
 
Off-label
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
reduces
 
the
 
regulatory
 
and
 
financial
 
burden
 
of
 
producers.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
Pew
 
Research
 
Center,
 
98%
 
of
 
Americans
 
now
 
own
 
a
 
cell
 
phone
 
of
 
some
 
kind,
 
and
 
91%
 
of
 
cell
 
phone
 
owners
 
use
 
a
 
smartphone.
 (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/)  There  are  minimal  barriers  for  consumers  to  access  Serving  Facts  information  in  2025.  The  ubiquitousness  of  the  smartphone  
and
 
the
 
internet
 
allows
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
access
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
information
 
if
 
they
 
so
 
choose.
 
8.  How  would  the  option  of  disclosing  the  proposed  Alcohol  Facts  information  via  electronic  
means
 
affect
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
disclosure
 
via
 
electronic
 
means?
 
Disclosing  Serving  Facts  via  electronic  means  lessens  the  costs  and  regulatory  burdens  for  small  
producers,
 
who
 
comprise
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
American
 
wine
 
industry.
 
The
 
ease
 
of
 
updating
 
this
 
information
 
for
 
different
 
vintages
 
of
 
wines
 
is
 
much
 
more
 
cost
 
effective
 
for
 
producers,
 
rather
 
than
 
having
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
physical
 
label
 
for
 
each
 
product
 
whenever
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
the
 
information.
 
Certain
 
other
 
benefits
 
include
 
avoiding
 
clutter
 
on
 
a
 
label,
 
which
 
in
 
turn
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
The
 
electronic
 
disclosure
 
also
 
allows
 
the
 
consumers
 
who
 
wish
 
to
 
view
 
the
 
Serving
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
in
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
dedicated
 
location.
 
 
9.  If  TTB  were  to  allow  mandatory  information  to  be  disclosed  electronically,  should  TTB  allow  
all
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
electronically
 
or
 
should
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
physical
 
label?
 
If  TTB  were  to  allow  for  electronic  disclosure  of  mandatory  information,  all  of  the  Serving  Facts  
information
 
that
 
TTB
 
may
 
require
 
should
 
be
 
disclosed
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
place
 
to
 
avoid
 
confusion.
 
10.  If  TTB  allowed  multiple  options  to  convey  Alcohol  Facts  information  to  consumers,  could  the  
lack
 
of
 
uniformity
 
create
 
consumer
 
confusion?
 
We  do  not  believe  so,  as  long  as  the  electronic  disclosure  is  clearly  notated.   
 Serving  Size  Reference  Amounts  
TTB  is  proposing  that  for  wine  that  is  7%  to  16%  alcohol  by  volume  a  serving  be  considered  5  
fluid
 
ounces
 
and
 
for
 
wine
 
that
 
is
 
16%
 
to
 
24%
 
a
 
serving
 
be
 
considered
 
2.5
 
fluid
 
ounces.
 
 
WineAmerica  supports  and  agrees  with  this.  We  also  agree  with  TTB  that  serving  size  reference  
amounts
 
are
 
not
 
intended
 
as
 
recommended
 
consumption
 
amounts
 
but
 
rather
 
are
 
intended
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
reference
 
amount
 
for
 
the
 
consumer
 
to
 
determine
 
alcohol,
 
nutrient,
 
and
 
calorie
 
intake.
 
 
On  the  specific  questions:  
1.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  a  reasonably  accurate  representation  of  the  amount  of  the  
product
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
serving?
 
If
 
not,
 
what
 
data
 
or
 
other
 
information
 
should
 
TTB
 
consider
 
that
 
would
 
give
 
a
 
better
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
amount
 
customarily
 
consumed
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
product
 
category?
 
Yes,  5  fluid  ounces  is  largely  considered  to  be  a  standard  serving  size  for  table  wine,  and  aligns  
with
 
the
 
current
 
Dietary
 
Guidelines
 
for
 
Americans.
 
 
2.  Are  the  proposed  reference  amounts  more  accurate  than  the  serving  sizes  set  forth  in  TTB  
Ruling
 
2004-1
 
(1.5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
5
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
wines,
 
and
 
12
 
fl
 
oz
 
for
 
malt
 
beverages,
 
regardless
 
of
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content)?
 
Why
 
or
 
why
 
not?
 
Yes,  we  believe  this  is  accurate  for  wine.  
3.  Should  TTB  allow  greater  flexibility  in  serving  sizes?  
While  many  restaurants  serve  higher  fluid  ounces  per  serving,  it  is  widely  accepted  that  5  fluid  
ounces
 
is
 
a
 
standard
 
serving
 
for
 
wine.
 
 
4.  Should  the  serving  size  reference  amounts  be  exactly  equal  to  an  alcoholic  drink  equivalent  of  
0.6
 
fluid
 
ounces
 
of
 
alcohol,
 
or
 
would
 
this
 
mislead
 
consumers
 
by
 
not
 
recognizing
 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
are
 
typically
 
consumed?
 
This  would  be  confusing  and  misleading  to  consumers.  The  amounts  that  TTB  suggests  are  what  
are
 
widely
 
known
 
and
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
standard
 
serving
 
sizes
 
for
 
beverage
 
alcohol.
 
 
Dual  Column  Alcohol  Facts  Display  Panel  
WineAmerica  opposes  a  Serving  Facts  panel  on  wine  labels.  We  are  in  favor  of  a  linear  
disclosure,
 
or
 
a
 
web
 
based,
 
off-label
 
disclosure.
 
 
Implementation  Period  
WineAmerica  agrees  with  TTB’s  proposal  of  a  five-year  implementation  period  for  Serving  
Facts
 
disclosure.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
will
 
provide
 
producers
 
with
 
adequate
 
time
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
changes
 
that
 
TTB
 
will
 
eventually
 
propose.
 
A
 
five
 
year
 
implementation
 
period
 
will
 
allow
 
for
 
producers
 
of
 
all
 
sizes
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
additions
 
to
 
their
 
existing
 
labels.
 
We
 
appreciate
 
that
 
TTB
 
is
 
not
 proposing  a  new  COLA  approval  when  the  serving  facts  information  will  be  the  only  addition  to  
the
 
label.
 
It
 
is
 
our
 
hope
 
that
 
will
 
include
 
the
 
option
 
for
 
off-label
 
disclosure.
 
 
TTB  asks  if  producers  will  begin  the  necessary  changes  before  the  end  of  the  implementation  
period.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
this
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
case.
 
Additional  Comments  on  Testing  of  Products  
WineAmerica  is  in  favor  of  disclosure  of  serving  facts,  but  in  a  way  that  is  not  over  burdensome  
to
 
wine
 
producers.
 
TTB
 
outlines
 
that
 
the
 
estimated
 
cost
 
of
 
changing
 
a
 
label
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
$1600
 
per
 
label.
 
This
 
cost
 
can
 
be
 
cut
 
down
 
considerably
 
if
 
an
 
off-label
 
disclosure
 
is
 
allowed.
 
●  Wineries  should  not  have  to  test  all  of  their  products  for  disclosure  of  serving  facts.  It  has  
been
 
estimated
 
that
 
it
 
could
 
cost
 
up
 
to
 
$500
 
per
 
product
 
if
 
comprehensive
 
testing
 
is
 
required.
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
would
 
not
 
require
 
industry
 
members
 
to
 
send
 
each
 
batch
 
of
 
a
 
product
 
to
 
a
 
laboratory
 
for
 
analysis
 
prior
 
to
 
labeling
 
the
 
product;
 
nor
 
would
 
it
 
require
 
any
 
testing
 
at
 
all.
 
Industry
 
members
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
analytical
 
testing,
 
published
 
databases,
 
mathematical
 
calculations
 
based
 
on
 
alcohol
 
content
 
(for
 
certain
 
products),
 
or
 
an
 
appropriate
 
blend
 
of
 
these
 
methods
 
to
 
accurately
 
label
 
their
 
products.
 
WineAmerica
 
supports
 
this.
 
 ●  TTB  issued  public  guidance  to  broaden  the  tolerance  levels  for  calorie  statements  on  
labels
 
and
 
in
 
advertisements.
 
In
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule,
 
TTB
 
has
 
included
 
this
 
expanded
 
tolerance
 
level
 
for
 
calories,
 
and
 
is
 
adopting
 
an
 
objective
 
standard
 
for
 
the
 
three
 
nutrients
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed,
 
allowing
 
a
 
tolerance
 
of
 
20
 
percent
 
above
 
or
 
below
 
the
 
labeled
 
amount.
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
these
 
proposed
 
changes
 
will
 
facilitate
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
“typical
 
values”
 
charts
 
and
 
other
 
methodologies
 
to
 
calculate
 
the
 
calories,
 
carbohydrates,
 
fat,
 
and
 
protein
 
content
 
of
 
an
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
product.
 
TTB
 
is
 
also
 
proposing
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
tolerance
 
for
 
malt
 
beverage
 
labeling
 
statements.
 
This
 
means
 
bottlers
 
would
 
be
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
change
 
labels
 
due
 
to
 
minor
 
variations
 
in
 
alcohol
 
content
 
among
 
different
 
batches.
 
Wine
 
America
 
supports
 
this
 
as
 
well.
 
 
Conclusion  
WineAmerica  would  like  to  thank  TTB  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  proposed  
rulemaking:
 
Notice
 
237:
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
Statements
 
in
 
the
 
Labeling
 
of
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits,
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages.
 
To
 
sum
 
up
 
our
 
main
 
points:
  ●  An  off-label/web  based  solution  should  be  allowed  for  disclosure  of  serving  facts.  ●  On-label  disclosure  should  be  in  a  linear  format.  ●  In  order  to  avoid  confusion,  the  disclosure  should  be  referred  to  as  SERVING  FACTS,  
not
 
ALCOHOL
 
FACTS.
 ●  Testing  of  each  product  should  not  be  required.  ●  We  hope  that  TTB  will  bear  in  mind  that  the  10,000+  American  wineries  are  
predominantly
 
small
 
family
 
farms
 
with
 
very
 
limited
 
resources,
 
and
 
that
 
$1600
 
per
 
label
 
and
 
$500
 
per
 
product
 
test
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
major
 
financial
 
burden.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including 
many small, family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the 
nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   W e provide the 
following comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 237: Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (NPRM 237). 
 
In general, Wine Institute supports the current “Serving Facts” framework as voluntary.  If TTB 
imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling, we respectfully request a similar framework but 
with several important recommendations and considerations that we outline below.   
 
1. Wine is Unique—it is not a Recipe Product—and Wineries Vary Greatly in Size 
 
It is important to note at the outset that wine is u nique.  Wine is not a recipe product.  Unlike 
other beverages, wine is inherently tied to its place of origin.  Every vintage is different, and 
each wine varies by year, winegrape varietal, location, climate and growing conditions.   
Because the winemaking process is dynamic and highly variable, decisions impacting 
nutritional content can be made right up to the time of blending and bottling.  This is significant 
because wine labels are most often printed many months in advance of bottling and changes 
to those labels can take up to two years to implement. 
Beyond the vineyard and winery, the wine marketplace is also distinct in terms of both the 
number of producers and unique wines available.   According to TTB, there are currently more 
than 17,500 bonded wine producers across the US  and approximately 6,300 of them are in 
California.  Like our membership, the overwhelming majority of these are small, family-owned 
Page 2 of 10  
wineries that operate in a heavily regulated industry with correspondingly high cost s in 
establishing and maintaining their businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations 
be fiscally responsible, reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only 
if legitimate public goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  In furtherance 
of those good rulemaking principles, TTB should consider whether it has sufficient information 
and stakeholder input to design and implement new labeling rules  at this time.  We note that 
NPRM 237 poses more than  80 questions and expressly solicits comments on over 45 topics 
that range from general to specific.   That leaves many  of the issues subject to change  and 
creates a challenge for stakeholders to provide sufficient information and data in the time 
provided.  G iven that NPRM 237 constitute s a “significant regulatory action”  if adopted, it is 
important that the issues are fully vetted and TTB  is fully informed before deciding whether or 
how to proceed. 
 
Cost Burden Falls Unevenly on Wine 
It is appropriate that TTB is required to design regulations, including this proposed regulation, 
in the most cost-effective , least burdensome  manner while still achieving the intended 
regulatory objective.  We applaud TTB for seeking industry input in attempting to accurately 
estimate the costs, however, we are concerned that TTB ’s cost analysis does not fully reflect 
the likely fiscal impact on the nation’s 17,000+ wineries.  
 
TTB’s analysis of the cost impact on wineries is based in large part on NielsenIQ data including 
an estimate of the number of universal product codes (UPCs) associated with wines in the US 
marketplace.  We are very concerned that focusing on UPCs  may vastly undercount the 
number of wine labels that this proposal would require to be changed.  Many wine labels do 
not include a UPC  because thousands of wineries rely on non-traditional sales channels 
including direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales and winery tasting room sales  where a UPC is not 
needed.  DTC wine sales are a unique and important feature of the wine marketplace now that 
48 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of DTC wine sales.  Wine analytics firm, 
bw166, has done research showing that Nielsen/NIQ data represents only 54 percent of all tax 
paid volume entering the US wine market in 2024.
1  
 
If TTB’s analysis does  not appropriately account for the gaps in the data it is using , then it is 
likely that its analysis grossly underestimates the potential costs for wineries.   We are 
concerned this analysis undercount s the thousands of wines that do not reach consumers 
through traditional distribution and retail channels  and thus are not accounted for in the 
Nielsen data.  Between 2018 and 2024, TTB approved an average of 113,536 COLAs for wine 
per year.  In recent years, TTB has also expanded the list of items that may be revised on wine 
labels without the need to resubmit a new COLA application.  This list now includes forty 
different pieces of information that can be changed without the need for a new COLA which 
suggests that many COLAs may be active in the marketplace for multiple years  (if not many 
years).  As a result, bw166 estimates that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 distinct wine 
products for sale in the US at any given time  and which would require a newly designed label  
 
1 https://www.bw166.com/data-science-services/  Page 3 of 10  
as a result of this proposed regulation. 2  The sheer size and diversity of the wine marketplace 
means the cost of this proposal would be significant for wineries of all sizes. 
 
We also note that as presented in NPRM 237, TTB’s cost analysis demonstrates that the cost 
burden of the proposal will fall disproportionately on wine producers.  Table 4 shows that with 
a five-year compliance period, fully 49 percent  of the total cost of the proposal would fall to 
wineries, while spirits and beer producers would face half the cost  of wineries.  Yet when TTB 
estimates the number of Total Units in the marketplace in Table 1, wine constitutes only 18  
percent of the Total Units. Wine Institute is very concerned about the impact this uneven cost 
burden will have on the t housands of small and medium sized wineries in the US.  We are 
continuing to review TTB’s cost analysis and seek input from our winery members on the 
anticipated costs of this proposal and will be sharing that information with TTB when available. 
 
2. Wineries Should be Allowed to Provide Serving Facts Information by Electronic 
Means (e.g., QR Codes) 
 
In NPRM 237, TTB explains  that it considered but is not proposing to allow the Serving Facts 
panel to be distributed by electronic means via a link, code, or other marking on the physical 
label.  Instead, TTB proposes requiring the full panel to appear on the physical label, but it also 
sought comments about its assumptions on this topic. 
 
Established Benefits of Permitting QR Codes 
Permitting the use of electronic means —such as a Quick Response ( QR) code—to present 
Serving Facts would provide many be nefits to many  stakeholders including consumers, 
producers, retailers, and regulators.  In NPRM 237, TTB recognized some of the benefits.  They 
included cost -efficiency, flexibility, reduction in time -to-market, and the ability to present 
relevant information in a more consumer -friendly format that is away from overcrowded 
physical labels.  There are other benefits, however, including: 
 
• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer  in real time, which is 
not possible using physical labels.   This is already used to comply with the E uropean 
Union’s (EU) labeling requirements for wine—which permits mandatory nutrition and 
ingredient information via QR code—given the EU’s 24 official languages. 
• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired.
3 
• Reduced waste, consistent with industry sustainability goals, since the use of e-labels 
reduces label re-prints.

making-food-more-accessible-for-the-visually-impaired (“QR codes can link to audio descriptions when scanned with 
a smartphone.  This feature can provide detailed information about the product, including ingredients, cooking 
instructions, and dietary information.”) ; see also, BBC News, The codes helping visually -impaired people shop, 
available at https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57679943. Page 4 of 10  
QR Codes in the Marketplace 
Electronic means such as QR codes are already common in the marketplace.   For instance , 
in NPRM 237, TTB cited broad implementation of digital labels  for wine  in the EU and the 
benefits electronic information disclosure could have for international trade.   We agree that 
permitting Serving Facts information by electronic means in the US will help harmonize 
approaches, minimize negative trade impacts, and facilitate US wine exports.  
 
The EU is not the only place where mandatory disclosures are permitted exclusively via 
electronic means.   For example, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) permits products 
that are subject to the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard to provide the 
mandatory bioengineered symbol via QR code rather than on the physical label.
4  Likewise, in 
2023 amendments to the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act , 
the Legislature made clear that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recover y “may 
require that a beverage container intended for sale in the state be … marked with a scan code, 
a quick response (QR) code, or a universal product code or similar machine-readable indicia” 
when providing the mandatory California Redemption Value or “CRV” mark rather than 
printing or embossing it on the container.5 
  
Notably, GS1—the international global standards organization for developing and maintaining 
barcodes—is working toward what it calls Sunrise 2027.  That is the year by which the global 
supply chain (manufacturers and retailers ) will move toward “two-dimensional barcodes ” 
(e.g., QR codes) .  According to GS1, b y the end of 2027, retailers w ill need to ensure their 
point-of-sale systems are equipped with scanners capable of reading both traditional 
barcodes and 2D barcodes.  The shift has already begun with the new technology being tested 
in 48 countries across the world.  In short, QR codes will become more ubiquitous, common 
and familiar to consumers, and accessible as manufacturers and retailers make this shift in 
the coming years. 
 
QR Code Accessibility 
As a related point, it is critical for TTB to consider the direction and pace at which technologies 
are trending along with consumer access, familiarity, and preferences.  For example, in NPRM 
237, TTB references a 2023 survey that the Pew Research Center conducted .  TTB notes the 
survey found that “79 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned 
smartphones compared to 90-98 percent of higher income groups.”  The same survey data for 
2024, however,  shows that 84 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 
reported owning smartphones.
6  That is a five percent increase over just one year.  Pew’s 2024 
survey data also shows that nine out of ten (91 percent) Americans now own a smartphone. 
 
Other information at the inter section of technology, consumer products, and public policy  
demonstrates that  QR codes and other electronic means  of conveying information are 
 
4 See 7 CFR 66.100(b)(3). 
5 See California Public Resources Code section 14561(d). 
6 See Pew Research Center, Mobile Fact Sheet, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/ internet/fact-sheet/
mobile. Page 5 of 10  
increasingly feasible, accept ed, and effective .  The Information Technology and Innovation 
Foundation issued a report in 2022 in which it found that (1) US mobile coverage is 
“ubiquitous,” (2) 4G covers “almost 100 percent of the population,” and (3) “improved fixed 
wireless and low-earth orbit satellites are emerging to fill the remaining gaps” over the coming 
years.7  According to GS1, recent survey data showed that 79 percent of consumers are more 
likely to purchase products with a scannable barcode/QR code (via smartphone) that provides 
the additional product information that they would want to see.8  That number will likely grow 
as QR codes become more common. 
 
Wine Labels Already Contain Other Mandatory Information on Limited Space 
Due to bottle sizes , wine labels are often mere inches  tall and wide .  Some label suppliers 
identify 3.5 x 4 inches as  the “common” or “traditional” size for the front label on a standard 
750 milliliter wine bottle.  Back labels are often  smaller.  In sum, there is limited space  to 
provide information.  That is important to note because physical labels are already subject to 
various federal and state laws that strictly prescribe what wine label s must include, may 
include, and may not include.  Below are non-exhaustive lists with some examples: 
 
• Wine label s must include: a government health warning; brand name; producer, 
bottler, or (if applicable) importer name and address; class or type designation; 
alcohol content statement; sulfite declaration (if present at 10 or more parts per 
million); net contents; color ingredient disclosures (if applicable);  an appellation of 
origin in certain circumstances; and, as a practical reality, a barcode.
9   
• Wine labels may include: a vintage date, winegrape variety, the term “estate bottled,” 
appellation of origin or approved American Viticultural Area, certification claims (if 
applicable), and other descriptive information that consumers desire including tasting 
and sensory notes, food pairing suggestions, recognizable trademarks, or information 
about the winery, winemaker, and winemaking process.
10 
• Wine labels may not include:  any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or 
that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the 
addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading 
impression; that is  disparaging of a competitor's products; or any statement, design, 
device, or representation which is obscene or indecent; and more.
11 
 
In addition, labeling laws often dictate not only the  substance of what must or may be 
included on a label, but other details like the specific placement, font type, and font size used 
on labels.  Finally, wines set for export must comply with labeling regimes in the destination 
market.  As noted, this means US wines exported to the EU may use a QR code on the physical 
label to provide mandatory nutrition and ingredient information,  and—given there are 24

official languages across the EU—many US wineries use this solution that EU lawmakers 
provided. 
 
In sum, if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should permit the use of QR 
codes or other electronic means to disclose that information as an alternative to printing it on 
labels. 
 
3. The Title of the Proposed Panel Should Remain as “Serving Facts” 
 
The current voluntary rules for disclosing nutritional information use the title “Serving Facts”  
and have since those rules initially issued in 2013.  In NPRM 237, TTB proposes now using the 
title “Alcohol Facts” but also seeks input on whether it should continue using “Serving Facts” 
instead. 
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should continue using the title “Serving 
Facts” for several reasons.  The most obvious reason is consistency.   Again, since 2013, TTB 
has permitted the optional disclosure of the same nutritional information proposed in NPRM 
237 but under title “Serving Facts.”  That title is what consumers, producers, and retailers 
have come to know not only on labels but also websites and product fact sheets.  Changing 
that title after years of continued use will lik ely cause confusion.  Moreo ver, it is misleading 
and confusing to use the title “Alcohol Facts” when most of the information in the proposed 
panel has nothing to do with alcohol.  Instead, it presents information about serving size, 
servings per container, and respective amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein 
per serving.  Finally, “Serving Facts” is sufficiently distinct from FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” title 
and thus avoids any confusion with beverages that do not contain alcohol.  The title sho uld 
remain as “Serving Facts.” 
 
4.  An Implementation Period of Five Years is Reasonable and Necessary 
 
TTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal 
Register.  If TTB  imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling , we strongly agree with the  
proposed five-year compliance period and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing  it.  Five 
years would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new labeling 
processes which will help minimize —but not eliminate—financial and operation burdens.  It 
would allow ample time for public and stakeholder education  and regulatory guidance .  It 
would also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, and 
advertising materials and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in NPRM 237, five years is 
within the t ypical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according t o an  FDA 
regulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.

Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments,” 2016, 
available at https://www.fda.gov/media/98712/download. Page 7 of 10  
 
5. Proposed Serving Size and Servings Per Container Should be Maintained 
 
TTB proposes including a serving size of 2.5 fluid ounces for wines with above 16 to 24 percent 
Alcohol by Volume (ABV) and 5 fluid ounces for wines with 7 to 16 percent ABV.   TTB also 
proposes including the number of servings per container.  We consider the proposed serving 
sizes and a servings per container disclosure to be reasonable,  familiar to consumers , and 
consistent with what is used under the current voluntary rules and therefore appropriate to 
use if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts. 
 
6.  A Single Alcohol Content Statement Expressed as ABV is Appropriate 
 
TTB proposes including an alcohol content statement—expressed as ABV per serving—for all 
wines including for those with 7 to 16 percent ABV and, underneath, a statement of alcohol 
content in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts , it should require only one alcohol 
content statement expressed as ABV and not  require a statement in fluid ounces of pure 
alcohol per serving.  For many decades, ABV has been the near universal means for disclosing 
alcohol content for wines.  This is true in  the US and many parts of the world.  As a result, 
consumers are already familiar with and understand how to interpret ABV levels in wines.   
 
This consumer acceptance of ABV labeling is reflected not only in the US’s current labeling 
regulations but also in multiple trade agreements to which the US is a party.   The World Wine 
Trade Group Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling specifies that all parties must 
accept alcohol content labeling by volume (ABV).
13  Additionally, the US -Mexico-Canada 
Agreement (USMCA) includes a similar provision in Annex 3-C which also requires the parties 
to permit alcohol content labeling by volume. 14  In neither case do these agreements require 
or permit alcohol content labeling by other measures such as fluid ounces.  Likewise, the 
International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), in its International Standard for the Labeling 
of Wines, also includes alcohol strength expressed as a percentage of volume (ABV) as an 
item of compulsory information.
15 
 
ABV is what consumers know and understand.  A lcohol content expressed as ABV has long 
since been required for wines above 16 percent ABV and voluntarily used for most wines that 
are 7 to 16 percent ABV.  It is also used on spirits and malt beverages.   Thus, if  TTB adopts 
mandatory provision of ABV within the Serving Facts panel , that single disclosure should 
suffice and it should not also be required elsewhere on the label.   Wine Institute urges that  
TTB not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   Unlike ABV, 
consumers are  unfamiliar with alcohol statements  in the form of fluid ounces and thus it

would cause confusion.  The fact that it would be presented in addition to ABV, would only 
compound the likelihood for confusion.  The ABV statement provides all that an interested 
consumer needs to determine how much alcohol they are consuming and in a familiar and 
common form.  
  
Likewise, ABV information will provide uniform labeling of alcohol content that will assist 
taxpayers in complying with their obligations under the Internal Revenue Code and will assist 
TTB in identifying alcohol beverage products that pose compliance risks .  Those are reasons 
TTB cites for proposing alcohol content labeling.  Also requiring a statement in fluid ounces of 
pure alcohol per serving  will have no added benefit .  Instead, it will potentially cause 
confusion and burden businesses. 
As a final point, requiring a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving  could invite 
misleading and deceptive claims since it presents a number that appears lower than ABV and 
in a form that is unfamiliar to consumers (e.g., “Just 0.7 fluid ounces of alcohol!”).  TTB should 
avoid that problem by requiring only one alcohol content statement expressed as ABV .  It 
should not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. 
 
7.  TTB Should Consider Several Points Regarding Calories, Carbohydrate, Fat, 
Protein, and Sugar 
 
TTB proposes mandatory disclosure of calories  per serving, and carbohydrates, fat, and 
protein in grams per serving.  For sugar, the Serving Facts panel may express the number of 
total sugars in grams per serving.   
 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, requiring the amounts of calories, 
carbohydrates, fat, and protein in the Serving Facts panel does not present serious concerns 
for our members aside from those raised elsewhere in our comments (e.g., permitting 
provision via electronic means  like a QR code ).  That said, there are at least three important 
points that TTB should consider: 
• For carbohydrates, Wine Institute has  repeatedly expressed concern s about 
inaccuracies of the “by difference” method that TTB and FDA use for calculating 
carbohydrates in wine.  The “by difference” method as described by Merrill and Watt in 
the USDA publication, Energy Value of Foods: Basis and Derivation. Agriculture 
Handbook No. 74 (Merrill & Watt, 1973) is not accurate for wine.  TTB should work with 
FDA to permit the use of the more  accurate “quantitation and summation of sugars” 
approach as an approved method for calculating total carbohydrate content in wine 
and wine-based beverages. 
• In general, fat and protein amounts in wine will almost always be zero. 
• In general, California law prohibits the addition of sugar to wine.
16 
TTB should consider those points and perhaps seek further stakeholder input before imposing 
mandatory provision of Serving Facts. 
 
16 See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, § 17010. Page 9 of 10  
 
8. The Proposed Rules for Tolerances, Typical Values, and Format and Placements 
Options Should be Maintained 
TTB proposes an objective standard,  which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or 
below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.  TTB believes these 
proposed tolerances would facilitate the use of “typical values” charts and other 
methodologies to calculate the level of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in alcohol 
beverage products.   
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with the proposed “objective 
standard” tolerance of 20 percent and the continued ability to use “typical values” to calculate 
calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  Doing so will help allev iate some of the cost, 
operational, and other burdens—including the need for repeated and expensive testing—while 
still providing adequate information.  We note, however, that most wines have very little or no 
fat or protein.  Consequently, if a winery nee ds to declare a non-zero level (e.g. less than 0.5 
grams per serving for fat and/or protein), a 20 percent tolerance level may be insufficient and 
indeed may be below the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the analytical 
method used.  We recommend that for low levels (e.g. less than one gram per serving) that an 
absolute level be used as the specified tolerance rather than a percent  of the declared value.  
This concept is already used in other markets.  As an example, in the EU for declared le vels of 
carbohydrates, protein, and fat in food that are under 10  grams/100 grams in concentration, 
the allowed tolerances are expressed in absolute terms (i.e., +/- 2 grams for carbohydrates and 
protein, and +/- 1.5 grams for fat).
17 
If TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with its proposal to permit much 
needed flexibility in terms of format (e.g., panel or linear) and placement  (e.g., horizontal or 
vertical).  Likewise, we agree with TTB’s  proposal that if Serving Facts becomes  mandatory, it 
will not require industry members to submit new C ertificate of Label Approval applications 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion, or alteration, of a required Serving 
Facts panel or statement containing alcohol content information.  These important and flexible 
elements will help alleviate some of the cost and operational burdens on wineries and provide 
flexibility to decide what works best for their products.   We reiterate, however, that the best 
solution is to permit the provision of mandatory information via electronic means (QR codes) 
for the many reasons stated above.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237; Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To whom it may concern: 
 
As the association for the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) industry, including makers of food, 
beverage, personal care, and household products, the Consumer Brands Association champions 
the industry that makes the products you choose and the brands you trust. From household and 
personal care to food and beverage products, the consumer  packaged goods (CPG) industry 
plays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy, contributing $2.5 trillion to U.S. GDP and 
supporting 22.3 million American jobs. Consumer Brands advocates for uniform, workable, and 
durable regulatory frameworks that are informed by risk -based science, promote consumer 
choice, and build consumer trust across the sectors we represent. As such, we appreciate the 
opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol, and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB or the 
Agency) proposed rule titled, “Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.” (Proposed Rule).  
 
As TTB develops labelling standards for most wine, spirits and malt beverages, we encourage it 
to allow  for the use of digital technologies to share labelling information with consumers. 
Succinctly, we urge the agency to be flexible in how labeling information is provided, 
including recognizing the valuable role that digital disclosure tools like SmartLabel can 
provide in facilitating accurate and up -to-date information ultimately leading to greater 
transparency for consumers.   
 
Introduction 
 
SmartLabel® by Consumer Brands Association is a nimble, adaptable digital platform launched 
in 2015 by brand owners and grocery retailers to give consumers access to more detailed product 
information than could ever fit on a package. SmartLabel serves as the defacto standard for  
consumer transparency and allows brands to display state and federally mandated and voluntary 
label information . Currently 80 parent companies participate in the SmartLabel program, 
representing more than 1,000 brands and over 100,000 products across all CPG categories, the 
largest being food and beverage. SmartLabel data is maintained by the participating brands who 
can provide  up-to-date product information with the click of a button. SmartLabel can easily 
accommodate the addition of data for wine, spirits and malt beverages.  
 
Further, SmartLabel can augment  federally required nutritional, ingredient , and allergen 
information with voluntary details that go beyond the package label such as ingredient definitions 
and sourcing  information, links to allergy prevention and management resources , as well as  SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025

sustainability attributes and practices.  Much of the voluntary information in SmartLabel spans 
nutrition, product claims,  certifications, and disclosures that consumers really care about.  
Consumers interacted with the SmartLabel platform over 22 million times in calendar year 2024. 
A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands 
Association found that consumers most often view the nutrition, ingredient , and allergen 
information on the SmartLabel pages. The survey also found that one-third of consumers have 
used SmartLabel and/or scanned a QR code to access product information  and 97% of those  
have used SmartLabel more than once. Almost six in ten (59%) American adults are likely to trust 
brands that feature SmartLabel, and more than half (55%) of consumers believe that integrating 
product information with SmartLabel will improve their impression of the brand. Consequently, 
SmartLabel food labeling provides the product information consumers seek to make informed 
decisions about the CPG products they purchase. 
 
SmartLabel Standardizes the Product Data Display 
 
SmartLabel complies with GS1 data standards (sourced via the Global Data Synchronisation 
Network or GDSN) for all attributes displayed on the platform and is a single source of up-to-date 
and accurate CPG product details because the data is directly owned, managed, updated, and 
hosted by the brand owner or the brand owner’s solution provider. Further, SmartLabel utilizes a 
uniform display and structure, which facilitates the ability of consumers to quickly and easily find 
the information they are seeking.  
 
SmartLabel can play an important role in providing accurate and up-to-date product information 
about alcoholic beverages to consumers.  SmartLabel data is displayed in a consistent 5 -tab 
template for all product categories  (Food and Beverage, Household Cleaning, Personal Care, 
Over-the-Counter Medications, Dietary Supplements and Pet Food)  and includes 
all federally mandated information that would be required to appear on the label  
(except for date code labeling for infant formula, which must be provided for the 
specific packaged product). For food and beverage products, the tabs are Nutrition, 
Ingredients, Allergens, About this Product (most of the voluntary information, 
including claims, resides on this tab) and Company, Brand & Sustainability.

The product image in the header of all SmartLabel pages can be clicked to display an enlarged 
image to aid consumers in determining if the product they have in hand matches the SmartLabel 
information. 
 
SmartLabel nutrition, ingredient, and allergen details are displayed in a consistent, readable 
template that mirrors the information on the packaging  and allows for variations in product 
formulations. The product image in the SmartLabel template header can be clicked to display an 
enlarged image of the package, which can be helpful for people with vision impairment. 
 
SmartLabel presents FDA mandatory information (nutrition information, ingredients, allergens, 
statement of identity, net quantity of contents, name and place of business, percent juice 
declaration and flavor labeling where applicable) in a consistent, easy to access and easy to read 
format. The SmartLabel program uses implementation manuals working with brands to provide 
information in accordance with applicable regulations for a consistent, reliable experience for 
consumers. For instances, the implementation manual for food and beverage prescribes that “the 
Nutrition Panel must exactly mirror what appears on the physical package for single column 
displays. ‘Exactly’ refers to all elements of the FDA’s Nutrition Facts label design including relative 
font sizes, indentations, alignment, and separation bar width. The Nutrition tab is not constrained 
by package size so the Nutrition Facts Panel should follow the FDA guidelines without truncation.” 
SmartLabel could implement a template that meets Alcohol/Serving Facts labelling requirements 
if any.  
 
The SmartLabel Trademark Licensing Agreement signed by all SmartLabel participants requires 
them to adhere to the specifications in the SmartLabel Food and Beverage Implementation 
Manual for the design and content in their SmartLabel pages. The program con ducts annual 
reviews of SmartLabel pages to make certain the data is consistent between the product 
packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page. Elements that do not comply with 
programmatic and / or regulatory requirements are identified, and brands are given a reasonable 
time frame to bring their pages into compliance.   
 
SmartLabel is Accessible 
 
SmartLabel product pages can be accessed easily in several different ways including 
smartphones, tablets, and computers – and allow users to view the information in an easily legible 
format regardless of device . SmartLabel pages appear in the browser and do not require any 
software to download or install to view SmartLabel.   
 
Consumers commonly use the native camera app on a smartphone or tablet to scan the 
SmartLabel branded QR code to reach the digital product information.  SmartLabel also offers a 
free application that can be downloaded for both iPhone and android smartphones. The app 
allows users to scan UPC barcodes for products that participate in SmartLabel. SmartLabel pages 
can also be searched and accessed using the Sm artLabel product database 
(https://SmartLabel.org/product-search) without access to the actual package. 
 
Given the ubiquity of smartphones and wide availability of broadband, consumers can readily 
access SmartLabel information by scanning the SmartLabel branded QR code. USDA’s 
Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS) has found that as of 2021, most Americans (97 percent) SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 4 of 10 
 
owned a smartphone of some kind.1 In particular, the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent 
of urban adults, 84 percent of suburban adults, and 80 percent of rural adults in America own a 
smartphone2. The Pew Research Center also found that 61 percent of individuals 65 and older  
own a smartphone.  
 
Similarly, QR code interactions increased by an estimated 6,200% between 2017 and 2021, with 
91% of consumers now having used a QR code at least once, and 87.1% of survey participants 
stating that QR codes are easy to use. 3 Moreover, internet access today is not the issue it once 
was. Today, 95% of American adults have reported that they use the internet.4  
 
Further, SmartLabel pages comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by 
the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Accessibility Initiative, which partners with 
organizations around the world to provide a high degree of internet usability for people with 
disabilities by: 
• ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility 
• developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and 
authoring tools 
• developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools 
• supporting education and outreach on web accessibility 
• coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the 
web 
• promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards 
 
The SmartLabel Template 
 
The SmartLabel landing page for food and beverage products is the Nutrition Tab, which 
replicates the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) on pack, including the FDA required formatting. In-
depth interviews from the 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands Association 
and FMI, revealed consumers found the product information in SmartLabel to be very clear, easy 
to navigate and easy to read. Consumers explained the digital rendering of the NFP in SmartLabel 
is easier to read than the NFP on-pack.

Ingredients are displayed on the second tab in descending order of predominance in a stacked, 
legible format. Many of the food and beverage implementors in SmartLabel also include voluntary 
information on ingredient definitions and functions , which can be accessed by clicking on the 
arrow next to the listed ingredient . The ingredients tab also supports information on ingredient 
sourcing and growing methods, providing consumers with valuable information about the products 
they consume.

The third tab, Allergens, displays a statement identifying the nine major food allergens under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Allergens contained in the product are listed in a stacked 
format, with the option for brands to also provide additional information on the composition of the 
allergen – for example, the allergen “milk” in a product might be composed of pasteurized milk 
and cream, dried milk , and cream cheese  – and links to allergy prevention and management 
resources. 
The fourth tab – About this Product  – displays voluntary information like claims, certifications, 
health and safety  warnings and product instructions. The fifth tab – Company, Brand & 
Sustainability – displays hyperlinks to the brand’s customer suppor t and website, company

website, Dietary Guidelines for Americans and USDA My Plate. The fifth tab is also used to display 
product sustainability attributes like How2Recycle , Recycle Check, CIRT  and hyperlinks to 
corporate sustainability practices. 
SmartLabel is a viable option for manufacturers to provide product information, both mandatory 
and voluntary, that may not be as readily available or in -depth on the product packaging. Other 
types of detailed product information that are available to consumers through SmartLabel that go 
beyond what is commonly available on the product packaging  include information about, 
bioengineered food declarations, product certifications, sustainability attributes, and company or 
brand information.  
 
Additionally, SmartLabel informs consumers that a product contains a known allergen and, if 
provided by the manufacturer, can go further and advise if the product was made in a shared 
facility or even on shared equipment for hyper-sensitive consumers. 
 
SmartLabel Facilitates Data Management  
 
For CPG manufacturers, the processes for managing digital product content generally run in 
parallel with the changes made to the physical label. Manufacturers need to determine when the 
updated product and its label will be in market to identify when it would be appropriate to circulate 
the updated online retail information. This determination does not follow a specific timeline  
because it is based on the estimated turnover rate of the product that is in commerce.  
 
Manufacturers can update SmartLabel to accommodate reformulations in near real time . 
Furthermore, SmartLabel displays the  date of the  information up date in the footer of each 
SmartLabel page: 
 
 
 
 
Consumer Research Validates SmartLabel as a Digital Transparency Tool 
 
Through consumer research , SmartLabel has confirmed that consumers expect the labeling 
information in SmartLabel to be consistent with the information on the label. As noted, the program 
SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 8 of 10 
 
conducts annual reviews of SmartLabel pages to ensure the data is consistent between the 
product packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page.  
 
Consumer research conducted in 2023 by SmartLabel nationally with 1,000 respondents across 
all demographic groups found that 43% of consumers are very likely to access more product 
information online (compared to what is provided on the label).  
 
For reasons related to their family’s well-being, 80% of respondents said they would like to know 
more about products than what is usually  on the package label . When asked about shopping 
online, 80% of survey respondents said they seek more information about a product when 
shopping online than when shopping in-store. 
 
The same survey found that 84% of consumers said they believe product information directly from 
the manufacturer is most accurate. SmartLabel pages are populated directly by the brand owners. 
 
Consumers also sa id access to product information in SmartLabel is faster and easier  to read 
than the same information on the package label . The 5 -tab SmartLabel template serves as a 
standard and ensures consistency in the way product information is displayed  
 
Digital Disclosure Provides Benefits to Manufacturers and Consumers 
 
The benefits of digital labeling accrue to both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers demand 
transparency and value the detailed ingredient, nutrition and health information  in SmartLabel. 
They appreciate the consistency of the SmartLabel design, its organized layout and the ease of 
access. Moreover, providing information via off -label, electronic means benefit s consumers by 
ensuring they receive the most up -to-date, accurate, and more comprehensive information  
directly from the product manufacturers.  A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents 
conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands Association and FMI found that: 
• 58% of consumers look for SmartLabel on products  and 51% are likely to buy products 
featuring SmartLabel. 
• 60% of consumers are likely to trust brands that feature SmartLabel. 
• Accurate and up -to-date product information and detailed product information a re key 
purchase drivers. 26% of consumers are willing to pay more for products that offer 
additional information through SmartLabel.  
 
For brand owners, the primary benefit of using the electronic or digital link disclosure option is the 
ability for the industry to rapidly and efficiently update product information, therefore minimizing 
packaging costs and packaging obsolescence. Updates are influenced by numerous factors 
including reformulations, supplier driven changes, supply chain pressures, packaging inventory 
turnover as well as limited vendor resources. Electronic or digital disclosure provides flexibility for 
manufacturers to quickly address product changes as ingredient supplies are updated and 
modified. A nimble and adaptable tool allows for efficient communication and transparency, 
ultimately benefiting consumers. with minimal disruptions to both the manufacturer and 
consumers.  
With SmartLabel, brands don’t need to touch their packaging as often, since changes can be 
made to the SmartLabel page on the fly. When a change is made on the SmartLabel page, it will SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237

appear everywhere the page is hosted in real time – on the brand ecommerce pages and retail 
ecommerce sites. In other words, with SmartLabel, manufacturers only have to make a change 
once, instead of on multiple platforms. As important, the ability to make real-time corrections and 
provide real-time information can streamline and aid regulatory enforcement efforts associated 
with any new and mandatory labeling rules. 
 
GS1 Sunrise 2027 is Just Around the Corner 
 
SmartLabel is collaborating with GS1 US in prepara tion for Sunrise 2027 – the transition from 
UPC barcodes to 2D barcodes (Digital Links). With a single scan on a smartphone, a GS1 digital 
link-enabled SmartLabel QR code will allow consumers to access nutritional information, 
allergens, sustainability and sourcing data on the SmartLabel product page. That same QR code 
can be scanned at the point-of-sale (POS) checkout counter for price lookup and a variety of other 
supply chain processes related to inventory management and recall readiness. More information 
on GS1 Sunrise 2027 and 2D barcodes can be found here. A June 13, 2025 article in Packaging 
World described how brands are piloting 2D barcodes today in anticipation of Sunrise 2027.

August 15, 2025  Ms. Amy Greenberg  Director, Regulations and Rulings Division Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau 1310 G Street NW, Box 12  Washington, DC 20005   RE: Document Number: TTB-2025-0002; 90 FR 6654 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (RIN 1513-AC93) Dear Ms. Greenberg: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) notice of proposed rulemaking: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, dated January 17, 2025.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) is the national trade association representing the wholesale tier of the wine and spirits industry. Founded in 1943, WSWA represents companies in all 50 States and the District of Columbia that hold federal permits and state licenses to act as wine and/or spirits distributors and/or brokers.   As an initial matter, WSWA strongly supports TTB’s work to implement the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) labeling requirements and views them as a critical tool to inform consumers while allowing for flexibility and innovation within the industry. We applaud efforts to modernize this system to meet evolving needs and advances in technology.  Our comment is limited to two elements of the proposal. First, we comment on Section VII.B.8.C regarding the electronic display of alcohol facts information. Secondly, we comment on Section VII.B.9 regarding serving size reference amounts.  I. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information    The proposal seeks comment on whether a final rule should allow the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means. We appreciate the perspectives TTB has received in previous comments both in support and opposition to electronic disclosure and agree with those commenters who have suggested Quick Response (QR) codes provide flexibility for industry members while empowering consumers with detailed, easy to ready information on an electronic device. As the proposal notes, rapid advancements are underway in technology and consumer expectations around how information is accessed, and we believe these factors will only increase in coming years making such technologies even more mainstream.  Further, QR-based information is already in use in many global alcohol markets where it is currently demonstrating its utility. With a simple capture of the code on the phone, all relevant information can be displayed in a clear, easy to decipher format in seconds.   Specific to readability, we note that QR codes can provide consumers with larger font sizes than the 1 millimeter minimum for wine and spirits and may provide a useful mechanism for viewing alcohol facts   
     
information in an easier to read format than some labels may provide. Often the QR view fills a smartphone screen and provides significantly more text size than would be found on a physical label, especially those for 50ml and other smaller standards of fill. Such flexibility addresses the very issues raised with linear display and type size for smaller containers.   We encourage TTB to allow electronic means as a mode of compliance for any new label requirements that may be promulgated.   II. Alcohol Expressed in Fluid Ounces may Lead to Consumer Confusion  Secondly, regarding serving size reference amounts, we comment on the questions posed in section VII.B.9 of the proposal. Specifically, we respectfully suggest that the proposed reference amounts will create unnecessary consumer confusion around what constitutes a “serving”. We recognize the proposal does not intend for the reference amounts to be “recommended consumption amounts”, but we believe they could easily be interpreted as such by consumers.   Under the proposal, consumers could be led to believe that, for instance, a distilled spirits product of 16% ABV or below is intended to be consumed in a 5-ounce serving. This is not universally true as many spirit products under this threshold are intended for use in smaller servings. In this case, having the 5-ounce serving could promote confusion around “real-world” calorie and alcohol content amounts. Similarly, in the expanding world of ready-to-drink cocktails, many similar products exist on both sides of the proposed 7% ABV delineation between 12- and 5-ounce serving references. This too could lead to significant consumer confusion around what a “serving” is intended to be for two very similar products. We encourage TTB to consider alternatives to this approach.   WSWA applauds TTB for this important work around how consumers access information and urges TTB to ensure that any changes required by a final rule avoid creating unnecessary consumer confusion and allow for industry members to utilize prevalent technology to satisfy new regulatory requirements.  Thank you for your consideration of our perspective on these important matters.  Respectfully Submitted,

Re: Comments on TTB Notice No. 237, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002: Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg: 
 
I write as President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirts Alliance (“ADSA”) to provide 
the collective comments of ADSA members to TTB’s Notice No. 23 7, entitled Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (the 
“Notice”).1  ADSA is a trade association of twenty member companies with common 
interests in the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in 
the United States.  ADSA members produce over sixty percent of all the distilled spirits 
sold i n the U.S.  Previously known as the Presidents’ Forum of the Distilled Spirits 
Industry, ADSA traces its history back over 40 years.   
ADSA and its members share TTB’s commitment to ensuring that consumers have 
access to accurate and meaningful information about the products they purchase and 
consume. We recognize the importance of transparency, particularly with respect to 
alcohol conten t and allergens that may affect consumer safety. At the same time, we 
believe that any regulatory changes must be carefully calibrated to avoid confusing 
consumers, imposing unnecessary costs on producers, or disrupting established trade 
practices in the United States and abroad. 
In these comments, ADSA responds to questions posed by TTB, offering 
recommendations based on decades of industry experience, consumer research, and 
lessons learned from both domestic and foreign regulatory approaches. We emphasize 
three overarching principles: 
1. The need for flexibility in how information is disclosed, particularly through the 
use of QR codes and digital tools; 
2. The importance of avoiding unnecessary or misleading ingredient 
disclosures that do not reflect the actual composition of distilled spirits; and 
 
1 90 FR 6654 (Jan. 17, 2025).   
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 2 of 6 
 
3. The critical role of collaborative, phased rulemaking  with adequate time for 
implementation, tailored to U.S. market conditions rather than imported wholesale 
from jurisdictions like the European Union. 
Current Labeling Rules and Consumer Understanding 
We believe that current labeling rules already provide consumers with the essential 
information they need to make informed decisions, including alcohol content by volume, 
class or type of spirit, and required health warnings. These disclosures, together wi th 
long-standing standards of identity for distilled spirits, ensure that consumers understand 
the basic characteristics of the products they are purchasing. 
That said, ADSA acknowledges that consumer groups and other stakeholders have 
expressed a desire for more information, particularly regarding serving size and potential 
allergens. We support TTB’s consideration of these issues but caution against expanding 
labeling requirements in ways that would overload labels with text, lead to consumer 
confusion, or introduce inconsistencies across product categories. A one -size-fits-all 
mandate will not achieve the goal of clarity for consumers and may instead obscure key 
information. 
Modern technology provides tools that were not available when current labeling rules 
were first established. QR codes, in particular, can bridge the gap between static on-pack 
information and consumers’ growing appetite for detailed data. By allowing produ cers to 
provide additional information digitally, QR codes prevent label clutter, enable regular 
updates without costly reprinting, and give consumers access to more robust product data 
than could reasonably fit on a label. We strongly encourage TTB to recognize QR codes 
as a central solution for future disclosures. 
A proven precedent exists in SmartLabel, a digital disclosure tool that has transformed 
how brands communicate product information. SmartLabel allows participating brands to 
display both state and federally mandated as well as voluntary label information in a clear, 
consistent, and consumer-friendly format. Currently, 80 parent companies—representing 
more than 1,000 brands and 100,000 products across all consumer -packaged goods 
categories, most prominently food and beverage—use the program. 
The data is maintained by participating brands, who can update product information 
instantly, ensuring accuracy and timeliness without costly physical label changes. This 
model enables manufacturers to present mandatory and voluntary information that may 
be too detailed to fit on traditional packaging, while still ensuring consumer access. In the 
FDA context, SmartLabel presents required disclosures —such as nutrition facts, 
ingredients, allergens, statement of identity, net quantity, name and place of busin ess, 
percent juice declarations, and flavor labeling —using a consistent and easy -to-read 
interface. 
In-depth interviews from a 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands 
Association and the Food Marketing Institute revealed that consumers found  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 3 of 6 
 
SmartLabel’s product information very clear, easy to navigate, and easy to read. The 
strong adoption by brands and positive reception by consumers show that a well -
structured digital disclosure tool enhances transparency and consumer confidence. 
By embracing QR codes and similar digital platforms for alcohol beverage labeling, the 
agency can facilitate timely, accurate, and complete disclosures without overburdening 
packaging, producers, or consumers. The SmartLabel model proves that this approach  
can work across a highly diverse marketplace, balancing regulatory needs with industry 
innovation and consumer expectations. 
Alcohol Content, Nutritional Information, and Serving Facts 
Alcohol content per serving is one of the most important pieces of information consumers 
can have. Current rules require ABV disclosures for spirits, but similar requirements do 
not apply consistently across all beverage types. As a result, consumers are left to guess 
how a serving of beer, wine, or spirits relates to U.S. Dietary Guidelines defining a 
“standard drink” as 0.6 fluid ounces (14 grams) of pure alcohol. We recommend that TTB 
standardize alcohol content disclosures across categories, requiring b oth ABV and 
alcohol content per serving to give consumers clear, comparable information. To promote 
responsible consumption, all serving sizes should be set equal to a standard drink. 
Providing for a “single serving” that differs from a standard drink woul d confuse 
consumers; if there is more than one standard drink in a container, the label should state 
the number of standard drinks. 
We encourage TTB to use “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts” as the title for the 
informational statement. Because the required disclosures will include both nutrient and 
alcohol content information, “Serving Facts” is a broader and more accurate de scriptor. 
This approach also avoids costly label updates for producers who already voluntarily use 
“Serving Facts” under current policy. 
We support allowing flexibility in format, including the linear display option, which is 
already in widespread voluntary use and easily located by consumers. For certain small 
formats—such as 50ml containers —we recommend an exemption from alcohol facts 
labeling, as space constraints make meaningful on -pack disclosure impractical. We 
further reiterate our request to permit off-pack disclosure through a website or QR code, 
ensuring consumers have access to complete and current information without 
overburdening packaging. 
Nutritional information such as calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and alcohol content 
can be useful to consumers, but TTB should not require other nutrients or elements (such 
as sodium, caffeine, sugar, cholesterol, fiber, vitamins, minerals, or fat breakdown) to be 
listed, as this may convey unintended nutritional or health value. Nor should TTB require 
inclusion of a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking. 
We also recommend that TTB allow compliance via a Statement of Average Analysis for 
products where exact alcohol content is not known at the time of label creation, such as  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 4 of 6 
 
“cask strength” whiskeys. This flexibility would preserve accuracy while recognizing 
production realities. 
In response to TTB’s question regarding the extent of current voluntary nutrition labeling, 
we note that many ADSA members already provide nutrition content information, with 
some doing so across their entire portfolios. This demonstrates that industry members 
are already responsive to consumer interest in this information without a rigid, one -size-
fits-all mandate. 
Ingredient Lists and Why They May Mislead Consumers 
We continue to believe that requiring full ingredient lists for distilled spirits would not help 
consumers make informed choices and may, in fact, mislead them. Distillation is a 
transformative process that removes nearly all traces of the raw materials us ed in 
production. For example, while wheat may be the starting material for vodka, the final 
distilled product contains no gluten proteins or other remnants of the grain. Listing “wheat” 
as an ingredient on such a product could lead consumers with celiac d isease to avoid it 
unnecessarily, or others to assume that vodka contains nutritional qualities associated 
with wheat, neither of which is true. 
TTB has previously recognized this problem, and its long-standing position—affirmed by 
the courts—is that ingredient lists for distilled spirits provide little value and may even 
misinform consumers. Standards of identity and statements of composition alre ady tell 
consumers what type of spirit they are purchasing (e.g., gin, Scotch whisky, rum), and 
these designations are widely understood. There is no evidence that ingredient lists would 
enhance consumer understanding beyond what is already provided. 
In contrast, the European Union has taken a different approach, requiring ingredient lists 
and certain nutritional information on alcoholic beverages. However, EU regulatory 
systems are harmonized across food and beverage categories and operate under 
different legal frameworks. Importing EU-style requirements into the U.S. would not align 
with our domestic labeling standards, would create significant costs for U.S. producers 
exporting overseas, and could disrupt international trade. U.S. policy should be guided by 
U.S. consumer needs and our established regulatory approach, not by wholesale 
adoption of foreign rules. 
Allergen Disclosure and Consumer Safety 
ADSA supports mandatory disclosure of allergens where science shows that allergens 
remain present in the final product and may pose a risk to consumers. We recommend 
that TTB align definitions of “major allergens” with the Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act while acknowledging that distilled spirits frequently contain no 
allergenic proteins from their raw materials. Where allergens are fully removed during 
production, no disclosure should be required.  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 5 of 6 
 
As is already the case in some jurisdictions, allergens that are clearly indicated in the 
product name—such as “hazelnut liqueur”—should not require duplicative labeling. Over-
disclosure could create confusion or cause unnecessary concern for consumers. 
Cost Implications and Small Business Impacts 
The costs of implementing new labeling mandates would be substantial. Producers would 
face expenses related to product testing, formula verification, label redesign, and legal 
compliance reviews. These costs would be particularly burdensome for small or ne w 
businesses, many of which lack the resources to conduct laboratory analysis or manage 
multiple label redesigns. 
To mitigate these burdens, ADSA strongly urges TTB to adopt a phased implementation 
period of at least five years and to avoid piecemeal rulemaking that would require multiple 
rounds of expensive changes. A single effective date for all labeling changes would help 
businesses plan and budget appropriately. We also applaud TTB for withdrawing the 
ingredient labeling rulemaking and for proposing a 5 -year implementation period in both 
the alcohol facts and major food allergens rulemakings. 
QR codes and web -based disclosures can further reduce costs by eliminating the need 
for frequent physical label changes while still providing consumers with the detailed 
information they may seek. 
The Need for Collaborative Rulemaking 
Labeling regulations are fundamental to consumer understanding, market integrity, and 
international trade. Any changes to these rules must be science -based, practical, and 
tailored to U.S. market conditions. ADSA urges TTB to continue engaging with 
stakeholders before drafting final rules, conducting thorough cost -benefit analyses, and 
considering real-world production practices. Rules that are too rigid, overly burdensome, 
or modeled on foreign systems will not serve U.S. consumers or producers effectively. 
We welcome the opportunity to participate in future dialogue, workshops, or advisory 
groups to help develop labeling rules that provide genuine value to consumers while 
preserving the competitiveness of the U.S. distilled spirits industry. 
* * * 
ADSA appreciates TTB’s leadership in evaluating these important issues and its 
willingness to engage industry stakeholders in the process. We support mandatory 
disclosure of alcohol content per serving and science -based allergen disclosures, 
provided they accurately reflect the final product. We oppose ingred ient lists for distilled 
spirits because they are scientifically inaccurate and potentially misleading. We strongly 
encourage TTB to adopt flexible, modern disclosure methods, particularly QR codes, 
which meet consumer needs without imposing undue burdens on producers or creating 
cluttered, confusing labels.  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 6 of 6 
 
Most importantly, we urge TTB to proceed collaboratively, engaging in an open and 
iterative rulemaking process that reflects U.S. realities rather than importing foreign 
approaches ill-suited to our market. ADSA and its members stand ready to work with TTB 
to ensure that future labeling rules are clear, effective, and practical for both consumers 
and producers.

The Proposed &ldquo;Single Serving Size&rdquo; Definition Is Likely to Cause Confusion <br/><br/>The proposed serving size with a threshold at 7% alc/vol is likely to cause confusion to craft beer consumers and brewers.  Craft beer spans a wide range of alcohol content, typically from 4% alc/vol up to 10% alc/vol, with the higher end of the range often being the distinguishing factor of craft beer from non-craft beer. Using New Belgium&rsquo;s brands as an example, 7% alc/vol. would split certain products of our brand families with multiple flavors on either side of the proposed 7% dividing line, causing different serving sizes within the family with only minimal shifts in alcohol content. With brand families generally positioned together on retail shelves, consumers would see mismatched information, creating confusion as to alcohol content and any nutrition information, and making it difficult for consumers to compare similar products. Craft beer consumers are familiar with the current disclosures of percentage of alcohol per volume, and New Belgium encourages the TTB to not introduce complicated alcohol content or serving size disclosures that would result in labels that are more confusing to craft beer consumers and brewers.   <br/><br/>III.

Conclusion<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>New Belgium agrees with TTB that the goals of the proposal would not be served by treating certain brewers as exempt from mandatory label disclosures. For the above reasons, New Belgium encourages TTB to reconsider the proposed rule on serving size thresholds to limit confusion to craft beer consumers and brewers.

Re: Docket No. TTB–2025–0002; Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling 
of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To Whom It May Concern: 
 
On behalf of AIM we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco 
Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule to require “Alcohol Facts” statements on alcohol 
beverage labels. 
 
About AIM 
AIM is the global industry alliance for stakeholders in Automatic Identification and Data Capture 
(AIDC) technologies, including barcoding, RFID, smart packaging, and connected solutions that 
enable accurate, accessible, and interoperable data. Our members represent all industries and 
applications that depend on trusted product information from manufacturing and supply chain to 
healthcare, retail, and consumer goods. For over 50 years, AIM has advanced the adoption of open, 
international standards to improve data quality, enhance transparency, and empower informed 
decision-making. 
 
Our Position 
AIM strongly supports TTB’s goal of improving consumer access to accurate, standardized 
information on alcohol beverage labels. Transparency is central to consumer trust, and 
standardized labeling built on internationally recognized data formats and identification systems 
ensures that the information provided is not only accurate and readable but also interoperable 
across platforms, supply chains, and digital environments. 
 
We believe that: 
 
• Standardization is essential – Mandatory “Alcohol Facts” labeling should use consistent 
data structures and presentation formats so that the information can be reliably 
understood by consumers, regulators, and digital systems alike. Utilizing recognized 
standards such as ISO/IEC 15459-1:2014 (Information technology — Automatic 
identification and data capture techniques — Unique identification Unique Identifiers) 
ISO/IEC 18004:2024 (Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture 
techniques — QR Code bar code symbology specification) and ISO/IEC 30161-1:2020 (Internet of Things (IoT) — Data exchange platform for IoT services Part 1: General 
requirements and architecture) will help ensure consistency and interoperability. 
• Digital access complements physical labels – Alongside printed information, machine-
readable data carriers (such as standardized barcodes or QR Codes linked to authoritative 
product data) can provide extended content, including multilingual details, allergen alerts, 
and sustainability information. The use of GS1 General Specifications, including GS1 
DataMatrix and GS1 Digital Link standards, will ensure that the “Alcohol Facts” label can 
integrate seamlessly into domestic and international distribution, retail, and e-commerce 
systems. 
• Interoperability enables efficiency – Leveraging established AIDC standards and best 
practices can help industry meet compliance requirements while reducing costs and errors, 
particularly for companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. 
 
AIM’s Offer of Support 
As the recognized authority for AIDC standards and best practices, AIM is willing to assist TTB and 
the industry in developing the technical guidance and frameworks necessary to implement these 
requirements effectively. We can provide expertise on: 
• Selection and application of appropriate data carriers 
• Data encoding standards to ensure interoperability 
• Integration guidance of physical and digital labeling for consumer engagement and 
regulatory compliance 
 
We commend TTB for advancing this initiative and share its commitment to protecting 
consumers, fostering transparency, and supporting fair competition. We welcome the opportunity 
to participate in future discussions or technical working groups that will help ensure the 
successful rollout of standardized alcohol labeling. 
 
 
Sincerely yours,

Our association represents more than 1,200 cider and perry producers across the United States&mdash;from orchard-based family operations to regional brands selling across multiple states. While our members vary in size and structure, they are unified by their commitment to transparency, craftsmanship, and agricultural tradition.<br/><br/>We support the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau&rsquo;s (TTB) goal of modernizing beverage alcohol labeling to ensure consumers have clear, consistent access to information about what they&rsquo;re drinking. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to consider the operational impact of these changes on small and agricultural-based producers&mdash;particularly those in the cider sector.<br/><br/>Nutritional Labeling Requirements<br/>The proposed nutritional labeling requirement presents one of the most significant challenges for small cideries&mdash;many of which are closely tied to local agriculture and farm-based production. Cider makers often rely on fruit grown on their own farms or purchased from nearby orchards, supporting agricultural diversity and rural economies. Many producers do not have access to in-house laboratories and would be required to send each product&mdash;or in many cases, each vintage or seasonal batch&mdash;out for expensive third-party testing. This would be cost prohibitive for many and could discourage the use of varied, seasonal fruit that reflects annual harvest conditions.<br/><br/>We strongly encourage the TTB to adopt a tiered approach to nutritional labeling, including:<br/>- Exemptions or simplified compliance pathways for producers under a defined annual production threshold, similar to the FDA&rsquo;s model for small food manufacturers.<br/>- The option to provide average or representative nutritional values rather than batch-specific data.<br/>- Permission to disclose nutritional information digitally via QR code &mdash; a system that is already accepted under the European Union&rsquo;s labeling requirements. This approach would promote international regulatory alignment, minimize packaging changes, and allow consumers ready access to accurate product information without imposing undue cost or operational burdens on producers. For limited-release, non-packaged, or taproom-only products, QR codes would allow minimal testing requirements while still meeting transparency goals.<br/><br/>Without such accommodations, the cost and logistical burden of compliance could significantly affect the smallest and most innovative segments of the cider industry&mdash;many of which are rooted in agriculture and depend on flexibility to highlight the diversity of fruit from year to year.<br/><br/>Label Flexibility for Small-Batch and Direct-to-Consumer Products<br/>Innovation is a hallmark of the craft cider movement. Many of our members release limited-edition blends, experimental fermentations, or single-varietal ciders in small volumes&mdash;sometimes only a few kegs or cases. These products are often sold directly to consumers and are not distributed through traditional retail channels.<br/><br/>For these types of products, we ask the TTB to allow more flexible labeling options, including:<br/>- Universal batch-level nutritional and allergen disclosures available on-premise or online.<br/>- Expanded use of QR codes to communicate required information without relabeling every SKU.<br/><br/>Implementation Timeline and Industry Support<br/>Should these proposed labeling changes be adopted, it is critical that cideries&mdash;especially those with limited staffing and infrastructure&mdash;are given sufficient time and support to comply. We support the phased rollout of the final rule, with five years of lead time for producers to comply.<br/><br/>In addition, we recommend the development of technical guidance materials, including sample label formats and FAQs.

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages, Notice No. 237, Docket No. TTB-2025-0003, 90 Fed. Reg. 6654 (January 17, 
2025)    
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Eilers:   
  
The National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) greatly appreciates the opportunity to 
provide comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on Alcohol Facts Labeling.1  
In the past, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has referred to this 
information as “Serving Facts.”   
  
The topic here is more longstanding than simply the Treasury Report on Competition2 cited by 
TTB.  For the past 20 years, TTB has considered the Serving Facts rulemaking and issued an 
administrative ruling on this topic, along with proposed rulemaking, and nutritional labeling 
guidance.  TTB has a continuing experience with this labeling topic.  And as noted during the 
listening sessions, several public advocacy groups have filed Federal litigation to seek action 
 
1 Prior to the publication of this notice, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) held two virtual 
“Listening1 Sessions” on these topics in February 2024, and NABI presented a statement and submitted a written 
comment at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/TTB-2024-0002-0416   
2 This report resulted from President Biden’s Executive Order 14036, Promoting Competition in the American 
Economy, dated July 9, 2021 at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/14/2021-15069/promoting-
competition-in-the-american-economy  On August 13, 2025, the President issued an Executive Order that revoked 
Executive Order 14036 at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/revocation-of-executive-order-
on-competition/    The Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission applauded this action as “protecting everyday 
Americans from anticompetitive practices through tailored action, promoting economic growth, and ensuring that 
American workers benefit from competition for their labor.” at https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-

here and that litigation is stayed (and not dismissed) during the pendency of this current 
rulemaking.    
 
TTB has dealt with rulemaking and administrative rulings on these issues during the George W. 
Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joseph Biden Administrations.  Typically, the 
regulatory climate of Washington, DC changes with each new Administration. The current 
Administration has issued several executive orders on the promulgation of new regulations and 
review of existing regulations to ensure “regulations [are] squarely authorized by constitutional 
Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome 
administrative state.”3  Additionally, the trend of recent United States Supreme Court judicial 
decisions on review of regulations has changed where agencies now face a higher burden to 
show that the regulation is authorized by the underlying statute.4   
 
The proposed regulations were published for public comment before the current Administration 
took office.  NABI believes they will face a higher bar of review and clearance by 
Administration officials and by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in particular. 
Accordingly, NABI’s comments recognize the regulatory climate of the current Administration 
and the higher bar facing TTB in a judicial review of its regulations.       
 
NABI respectfully recommends that the alcohol facts statements regulation remain as a voluntary 
statement that may appear on a label or is accessible to consumers by a Quick Response (QR) 
code.   
 
       
Sufficiency of Voluntary Alcohol Facts Statement 
 
TTB has dealt with the “Servings Fact”-type label disclosure regulatory considerations through 
proposed regulations and a TTB Ruling.  The proposed Alcohol Facts Statement labeling 
regulations require the same elements of information as the voluntary Serving Facts label: 
 
• Serving Size 
• Servings per Container 
• Alcohol by volume

The current requirements for the voluntary use of the Serving Facts label were issued in TTB 
Ruling 2013-2, May 28, 2013, V oluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and 
Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.5   
 
The current proposed rulemaking seeks comments on whether the Alcohol Facts Statement label 
should be mandatory information on a label affixed to the container or continue to be voluntary.  
The proposal also seeks comments on multiple options about the presentation of the label. In this 
regard, NABI is only commenting on the use of the electronic alternative to communicate the 
voluntary information to consumers.   
 
Mandatory or Voluntary 
 
Under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,6 TTB is authorized to issue labeling regulations 
that, among other things, will provide “adequate information as to the identify and quality of the 
products.”  TTB has broad discretion in issuing regulations under this standard.7  While the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is required to issue such food labeling requirements on the 
nutrient statement under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, TTB is not covered 
by that law.  Accordingly, TTB’s decision to issue the Alcohol Facts/Serving Fact requirement is 
discretionary.   
 
A review of the Supplementary Information on comments submitted previously to TTB opposing 
the Serving Facts label requirement shows that the singular opposition raised is the potential 
costs associated with a mandatory requirement.  In particular, the burden of these product testing 
costs on small and medium size importers and producers was noted.8  
 
NABI agrees that this information may be valuable to many consumers and believes that many 
industry members will include it voluntarily on a label or in a QR code reference.  TTB lists a 
number of steps it has taken to mitigate these costs, such as increased tolerance ranges, use of 
typicity charts, and the five-year transition period.   A pivotal concern is whether making this 
requirement mandatory will attract or raise concerns in the regulatory approval process which 
would not arise were the requirement remains voluntary.

8 See, 90 Federal Register at 6664 (January 17, 2025) 4 
 
In a survey of NABI members, many of the following reasons were cited for keeping the Alcohol 
Fact Statement voluntary.  
 
• The voluntary option has worked.  Industry members can present this information if they 
believe that their consumers want it. 
• Congress did not enact a specific legal requirement for the Alcohol Facts/Serving Facts label 
for beverage alcohol unlike other beverages.   
• The information must be understandable to the consumer.  For example, does the average 
consumer know what a serving size is?  It is not explained on the label and the consumer 
would have to look at a chart in the regulations in order to determine it.  Similarly, do 
consumers understand that the disclosures of quantities are subject to a tolerance of plus or 
minus 20 percent? 
• Have the petitioners established and do the past comments show that consumers want all of 
this information?   
• Compliance costs are passed along to consumers in higher prices.  
• The necessary testing is expensive and is recurring.  While TTB cites ways to mitigate the 
costs, do those undercut the value of the information for the consumer?  Broader tolerances 
and typicity charts provide less accurate and more general information to consumers.  
• Logistical challenges of the global market in these products arise where labeled product 
enter U.S. to be shipped to another country’s market where that country does not allow the 
information presented in the same manner as does the U.S.    
• From a cost perspective, a five-year implementation date still poses economic challenges to 
new entrants near the effective date or those who enter the business after the effective date.   
• Quick Response (QR) codes are a good option but still have costs to update and maintain.   
• V oluntary option is consistent with the Administration’s executive directives that regulations 
must not be burdensome and must be based on clear statutory authorization.   
• Importers are currently under economic stress due to the tariffs and this labeling requirement 
is an additional expense to mandate now.   
 
These reasons support maintaining the Alcohol Fact/Serving Facts.as voluntary information.   
 
 
Quick Response (QR) Codes for Voluntary Alcohol Facts Statements are Valuable if 
Properly Regulated 
  
Quick Response (QR) codes are valuable for conveying large amounts of information about a 
product without cluttering a front, neck, and back label given the limited physical “real estate” 
on a bottle or other consumer container.    
  
NABI supports the use of a QR code.  The quality and quantity of additional information that 
may be given to a consumer via the QR code is enormous and, moreover, the QR code allows 
this additional information to be updated constantly at a cost to the industry that is far less than a 
paper label.  The QR code gives the industry member the opportunity to include some 
explanation about the element of information that would not otherwise be available on the 
limited ""real estate"" of labels on the bottle or container.  Moreover, broad generational 5 
 
acceptance of e-devices and I-phones necessitate their use today. Consumers today look for the 
QR code on a label as an information resource.     
  
There is certain information about the wine, distilled spirits, and beer/malt beverages that must 
be available to all consumers and appear on a label on the bottle or consumer container.  The 
brand name, class and type of wine or distilled spirit or category of beer, name of the producer 
and/or bottler, and alcohol content are the elements of information that fall within this category.  
The alcohol by volume (ABV) content should appear on the label while the additional details 
provided in the alcohol facts statement could be accessed through the QR code.     
  
Finally, as a practical matter, for a country like the United States that has a pre-approval review 
of labels, how does TTB envision the label specialist reviewing the QR code information?  The 
information on the QR code site would need to comply with the TTB advertising regulations.9  
Would the importer have to submit a transcript or copy of all of the information behind the QR 
code?  Given the importer must obtain the certificate of label approval (COLA) and it is possible 
that the foreign producer will operate the QR code site, the importer will need to monitor the QR 
code sites that appear on the label.  Whatever approach is adopted by TTB, it must be reasonably 
administrable in order to protect the consumer.     
  
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or requests for clarification.  NABI greatly 
appreciates your time on this important public policy decision.  
  
Sincerely,

Subject: Comments on: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages  
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance , a strategic collaboration  among 
companies and with institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable development of Mezcal. Its 
purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint 
projects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  
solutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines 
Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT 
Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in 
accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical 
regulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial 
proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods 
 
Key points of the proposal: 
• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol 
content per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number 
of servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of 
alcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   
• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal 
Register is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
General comments on the proposal:  
 
Alcohol content 
It is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to 
inform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by 
the average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, 
and that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without 
requiring placement in a specific panel or format. 
 
Serving and servings per container: 
The proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container 
across all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. 
While it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in 
a standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If 
mandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), 
which would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or 
commercial burdens. 
 
Nutritional information 
 
The proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and 
proteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may 
confuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol 
 
should not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into 
viewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions 
based on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol 
consumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. 
 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? 
Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it 
unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food 
labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the 
percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful 
information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by 
implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily 
nutrient requirements? 
 
We believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any 
benefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is 
to prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could 
create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among 
consumers. 
 
We consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, 
sugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier 
than other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could 
confuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium 
content, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the 
consumer's diet and are not comparable. 
 
By its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental 
information on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that 
alcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision 
and favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of 
alcohol that each product contains. 
 
Making this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which 
goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  
trade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this 
information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible 
to consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
• Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Easy updating as regulations change. 
• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of 
harmful alcohol consumption. 
• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement 
these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in 
the U.S. 
 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
 
As previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels 
could lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious 
confusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) 
shows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is 
clear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion 
or misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. 
 
 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
 
As previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers 
to believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements 
like dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not 
recommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such 
declarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. 
 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
 
Including nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly 
believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like 
dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such 
information should not be required in any form.  
 
In Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits 
or therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus 
solely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness 
benefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising 
with alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising 
Regulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. 
These declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health 
messaging. 
 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health 
benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations 
on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
 
 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
 
 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity 
and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts 
labeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with 
such revisions? 
 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" 
panel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and 
regulatory burdens. 
 
 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
  
Making a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, 
this proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be 
more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -
fulfilment would create”. 
 
8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in 
particular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially 
small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging 
and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. 
This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
 
To reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is 
recommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements 
internationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Detailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health 
benefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid 
regulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers.

TTB Proposal on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a 
proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The 
main objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the 
alcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. 
Key points of the proposal: 
 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is 
proposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: 
1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid 
ounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). 
2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. 
3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 
4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal 
establishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary 
depending on their alcohol content. For example: 
i. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) 
ii. Wines: 
1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. 
2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. 
iii. Distilled spirits: 
1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; 
2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; 
3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid 
ounces (44 ml) 
4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. 
 
 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different 
formats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. 
 
 
 
 
 
Compliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register 
is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. 
 
Comments on the proposal: 
 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but 
question the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not 
considered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-
006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the 
declaration of the product's alcohol content. 
 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of 
alcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested 
that this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, 
digital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. 
 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as 
if these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius 
guidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and 
that nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the 
Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do 
the differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  
misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s 
labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the 
listed nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? 
Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol 
beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? 
Our position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely 
benefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage 
labeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels 
could easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which 
would only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting 
nutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that 
alcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing 
decisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. 
Furthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are 
fundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic 
beverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol 
itself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as 
somehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current 
labeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are 
distinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, 
which goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT 
Agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers 
to international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly 
recommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This 
makes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens. 
Digital labeling offers many advantages: 
 Unlimited space to inform consumers. 
 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
 Easy updating as regulations change. 
 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks 
of harmful alcohol consumption. 
 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. 
 
This approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using 
technology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. 
Finally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to 
implement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for 
distribution in the U.S. 
2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be 
allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further 
breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? 
It is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and 
trans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the 
misconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. 
3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such 
as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? 
The inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be 
misle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could 
confuse consumers. 
4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol 
beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create 
an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other 
health-related benefits? 
It is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could 
create a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true 
and could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or 
rehabilitation benefits. 
The General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be 
limited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them 
as something that improves health or well-being. 
Furthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages 
from being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from 
promoting harmful eating habits. 
The Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition 
by establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, 
rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. 
In summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or 
health benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such 
declarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. 
5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in 
advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? 
No comments on this topic. 
6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might 
consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the 
identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol 
Facts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated 
with such revisions? 
The current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate 
unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. 
7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol 
beverage market? 
This measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and 
distributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would 
go against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical 
regulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives 
justified by member states. 
According to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly 
necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures 
would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased 
costs associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new 
shipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, 
new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? 
The proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, 
especially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  
analyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply 
chains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. 
9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of 
alcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the 
proposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? 
It is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade 
in alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to 
consider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the 
use of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical 
labels, while reducing operational costs. 
Conclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol 
is sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided 
electronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant 
costs, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic 
beverages in general.

comments of the Mexican alcoholic beverages industry regarding the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend 
the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages, notified
(G/TBT/N/USA/2182) to the WTO TBT Committee in accordance with Article 2.9.2 
of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement).
While Mexico recognizes the objective of providing consumers with clear and 
comprehensive information, our industry expresses serious concerns that the 
proposed mandatory “Alcohol Facts” panel—particularly the inclusion of detailed 
nutritional information—could mislead consumers by suggesting that alcoholic 
beverages provide nutritional or health benefits. This approach contradicts 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines, Mexican legislation (General Health Law, Articles 
307 and 308, and its Advertising Regulation), and may distract from the core 
health objective of preventing harmful alcohol consumption.
Furthermore, the requirement to declare alcohol content in both % ABV and fluid 
ounces of pure ethanol per serving is unnecessarily complex and not easily 
understood by the average consumer. Similarly, the proposed mandatory 
declaration of serving size and servings per container would impose 
disproportionate regulatory and commercial burdens, particularly on small 
producers and exporters.
The Government of Mexico therefore strongly recommends that:
1. Nutritional information be provided on a voluntary basis or through
electronic labeling (QR codes, websites, or digital platforms), ensuring
access to relevant information without creating unnecessary barriers to
trade, in line with Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.2. Alcohol content be declared exclusively in % ABV, allowing its placement
anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible.
3. Implementation be gradual, with a minimum transition period of five (5)
years, to allow producers—particularly SMEs—to adapt their supply chains.
Mexico reiterates that the creation of labeling requirements that may mislead
consumers or impose excessive costs on producers could constitute an
unnecessary obstacle to international trade and have a disproportionate impact
on small and emerging businesses in the alcoholic beverages sector.
We thank you in advance for your kind attention to these comments and
respectfully request that they be duly considered in the elaboration of the final

It is only fair that alcoholic beverages like every other beverage and food item on the market contain per-serving information about calories, nutrients, and, when necessary, alcohol content. The reasons why I believe this proposed rule should go into effect are the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcoholic consumption, and the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are drinking. Firstly, this proposed rule is beneficial because of the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages like everything else we consume contain calories and if too many calories are consumed every day it can lead to weight gain, which we already have too much of in this country as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ldquo;on a given day, consumers of alcoholic beverages obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from alcoholic beverages&rdquo; (Nielsen et al, 2012). Assuming the consumers follow the recommendation of 2,000 calories a day that would equal 320 calories from alcoholic beverages every day. Without the proper labeling, consumers cannot know exactly how many calories they are consuming, making it extremely difficult to follow the recommended daily caloric intake if they are trying to follow it. Secondly, this proposed rule should go into effect because the United States is known to be an obese country with around 40% of adults being obese (Emmerich et al, 2024), as well as some research showing increases in obesity and heavy alcohol consumption in adults in the United States. Between 2017-2020 the combination of heavy alcohol consumption and obesity was 3.1% of adults in the United States which is up from 1.8% in 1999-2000, and it has increased 72% over time (Raza et al, 2023). That shows that not only is obesity and heavy alcohol consumption linked, but it is also on the rise. It very well could be on the rise because of the lack of consistent labeling on alcoholic beverages that do not always include the caloric value which can lead to an overconsumption of calories which in turn can cause obesity. Finally, this proposed rule should go into effect because of the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are consuming. When there is no consistent labeling among alcoholic beverages it can lead to confusion or if there is a lack of any labeling it can lead consumers to be uninformed about what they are consuming. A study of college students showed that 65% were unaware of the caloric content of the alcoholic beverages they consumed (Lloyd-Richardson et al, 2008). 65% of college students not knowing the caloric content of their alcoholic beverages is astronomically too high and this proposed rule could help lower that number by a large margin. Also, another study suggests that alcohol labeling can be effective in increasing consumers&#39; knowledge and understanding of the health risks involved in drinking alcoholic beverages (Edmunds et al, 2023). Just knowing the risks will not stop people from consuming alcoholic beverages, but it will allow them to make informed decisions moving forward, which could allow consumers to live healthier lives. Being informed about what is consumed is extremely important and is already in place for every other consumable good so it only makes sense to hold alcoholic beverages to the same standards. In conclusion, the caloric content of alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcohol consumption, and the benefit of increased information on alcoholic beverages are all reasons why I believe this proposed rule should become regulation under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.<br/>References: Edmunds, C.

Disclosing these substances on alcoholic beverage labels is important for several reasons:<br/>⸻<br/>1. Consumer Health and Safety<br/>&bull; Allergic Reactions and Sensitivities: Some individuals may be allergic or sensitive to PG or PEG. Reactions can range from mild skin irritation to more serious effects in susceptible individuals.<br/>&bull; Cumulative Exposure: PG and PEG are found in many products (e.g., foods, cosmetics, medications), so clear labeling helps consumers manage their total exposure, especially for those with health concerns.<br/>⸻<br/>2.

Comment for Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages 
Dear Director, 
As the CEO of a major import and distributing company, working with hundreds of small wine 
producers on every continent around the globe, we respectfully submit our opposition to the proposed 
Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
Since the beginning of wine making (probably dating back 7000 years), wine has been made in very 
much the same way. It is important to note that most wine is 85% biologically pure water, taken up 
through the roots and delivered to the grapes on the vine. The remaining 15% is made up essentially of 
alcohol, plus minute quantities of organic acids, sugars, minerals and tannins. 
To analyze the minute quantities that might be considered nutritional in the wine would be a huge 
burden for the many small producers we represent. Each producer makes many different wines, some in 
very small quantities; a separate analysis would have to be done for each individual wine, leading to a 
prohibitive burden in terms of both time and cost. This is time and money that most wineries simply do 
not have. Additionally, the American consumer would not realty benefit from the nutritional information 
— if any— which would result from such analyses and labeling. 
In conclusion: We already have so many regulations regarding labeling; adding this will just burden the 
industry further, without really enlightening the American consumer. 
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share our thoughts. We hope you will give serious 
consideration to our objections. 
Sincerely, 
Mordy Herzog, CEO 
Royal Wine Corporation

Alcohol facts statements in labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages

          I am not a heavy alcoholic drinker.  Occasionally, I will drink liquor or a wine cooler but, I have never read or noticed any caloric information about the alcoholic beverage.  Even if there was harmful information about the beverage being cancerous or increasing heart rate, I never noticed a label. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths per year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths were among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need to intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and treatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-building and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve monitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve capacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). 
     An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing additional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled spirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling was not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 report on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is Notice No. 237.  The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes calorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to know about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, religious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement of alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required to have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB published Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were February 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on labeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions was 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening sessions. Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, the original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025. 

Background

     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by the TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not finalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which means there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory calorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.  Plus, the “Serving Facts” would include the number of servings per container and serving size. 

     Since TTB did not finalize the rulemaking, on May 28, 2013, TTB published TTB Ruling 2013-2, Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. In this ruling, “Serving Facts” statement could be on a voluntary basis.  As a result, in the fall of 2017, TTB withdrew the “Serving Facts” rulemaking from the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Four years later, several consumer groups and public health advocates urged TTB to finalize the “Serving Facts” rulemaking in the “2021 CSPI letter”.  In other words, these consumer groups and public health advocates demanded a response. These consumer groups included the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Alcohol Justice, the American Institute for Cancer Research, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, the Consumer Federation of America, the National Consumers League, and the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.  Overall, the TTB is making progress and taking the necessary approaches in having appropriate information to be labeled for alcoholic beverages. 

Call to Action 

  Thirty percent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States is due to overconsumption of alcohol (Goldstein, 2024). Not only are there traffic crash fatalities, but there are numerous health problems that are linked to the overconsumption of alcohol.   Therefore, having alcohol labels can be a life-or-death matter. I support the proposal for alcohol content and nutritional information to be labeled on alcohol, but also include health warning labels.  I stand for “Alcohol has Ingredients Too”.

Thank you for sharing this important information! I agree that this proposed rule is overdue. It's surprising how little transparency there is in alcohol labeling, especially given the health risks. Like you, I often overlook the labels because there's not much useful info.

Alcohol facts statements in labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages
          I am not a heavy alcoholic drinker.  Occasionally, I will drink liquor or a wine cooler but, I 
have never read or noticed any caloric information about the alcoholic beverage.  Even if there 
was harmful information about the beverage being cancerous or increasing heart rate, I never 
noticed a label. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths 
per year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths 
were among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need 
to intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and 
treatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-
building and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve 
monitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve 
capacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). 
     An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the 
Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing 
additional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled 
spirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling 
was not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 
report on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol 
content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is 
Notice No. 237.  The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes 
calorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to 
know about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, 
religious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement 
of alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required 
to have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB 
published Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were 
February 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on 
labeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions 
was 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening 
sessions. Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, 
the original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025. 
Background
     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by 
the TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not 
finalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which 
means there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory 
calorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.  Plus, the “Serving Facts” would 
include the number of servings per container and serving size.      Since TTB did not finalize the rulemaking, on May 28, 2013, TTB published TTB Ruling 
2013-2, Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. In this ruling, “Serving Facts” statement could be on a 
voluntary basis.  As a result, in the fall of 2017, TTB withdrew the “Serving Facts” rulemaking 
from the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Four years later, 
several consumer groups and public health advocates urged TTB to finalize the “Serving Facts” 
rulemaking in the “2021 CSPI letter”.  In other words, these consumer groups and public health 
advocates demanded a response. These consumer groups included the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest (CSPI), Alcohol Justice, the American Institute for Cancer Research, Breast 
Cancer Prevention Partners, the Consumer Federation of America, the National Consumers 
League, and the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.  Overall, the TTB is making progress and taking 
the necessary approaches in having appropriate information to be labeled for alcoholic 
beverages. 
Call to Action 
  Thirty percent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States is due to 
overconsumption of alcohol (Goldstein, 2024). Not only are there traffic crash fatalities, but 
there are numerous health problems that are linked to the overconsumption of alcohol.   
Therefore, having alcohol labels can be a life-or-death matter. I support the proposal for alcohol 
content and nutritional information to be labeled on alcohol, but also include health warning 
labels.  I stand for “Alcohol has Ingredients Too”.   References

science in the public interest. https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/why-alcohol-labels-

deaths-due-to-alcohol-and-drug-use-majority-among-men/Thank you for sharing this important information! I agree that this proposed rule is 
overdue. It's surprising how little transparency there is in alcohol labeling, especially 
given the health risks. Like you, I often overlook the labels because there's not much 
useful info. Adding details like calorie counts and nutrient info could really help people 
make better choices, especially those trying to watch their intake. As social workers, we 
play a key role in promoting community health, and clearer labels align well with our 
commitment to empowerment and education.",0,-1,"[-1, 6, 28]",-1,6,28,neutral,0.997550904750824,"{'admiration': 7.583149272250012e-05, 'amusement': 8.840000373311341e-05, 'anger': 0.00010136599303223193, 'annoyance': 0.00025432740221731365, 'approval': 0.00047078923671506345, 'caring': 4.5586435589939356e-05, 'confusion': 0.0001529846922494471, 'curiosity': 7.3584946221672e-05, 'desire': 3.070889943046495e-05, 'disappointment': 0.00010492717410670593, 'disapproval': 0.00012861783034168184, 'disgust': 6.046413182048127e-05, 'embarrassment': 2.7156131181982346e-05, 'excitement': 6.982008198974654e-05, 'fear': 6.825228774687275e-05, 'gratitude': 4.504021126194857e-05, 'grief': 1.689855707809329e-05, 'joy': 6.833356019342318e-05, 'love': 3.0901974241714925e-05, 'nervousness': 1.7831196601036936e-05, 'optimism': 7.331716187763959e-05, 'pride': 1.1147639270348009e-05, 'realization': 0.00028061174089089036, 'relief': 1.3445260265143588e-05, 'remorse': 1.4519309843308292e-05, 'sadness': 8.336851897183806e-05, 'surprise': 4.086816989001818e-05, 'neutral': 0.997550904750824}"

In short, the second tier of beverages containing more than 7% alcohol by volume (ABV) and up to 16% ABV, which currently assigned a serving size of 5 fl oz in the proposal, should have a serving size of 12 oz because this reflects the way in which such beverages are typically consumed, i.e., in 12 fl oz bottles or cans. As TTB&rsquo;s proposal stands, only malt beverages containing 7% or less ABV are assigned a serving size of 12 fl oz.

Though beeradvocate.com focuses on craft beers which often have higher ABV than is typical for beer and which may not reflect the most mainstream alcohol consumption habits, craft breer still accounts for a large amount of alcohol consumption.

Both are predominately packaged in and consumed directly from 12 fl oz bottles or cans. TTB&rsquo;s proposal to establish a serving size of 5 fl oz for such beverages will only serve to confuse consumers because the consumption habits for beers in both categories are the same: drink to completion. 12 fl oz bottles and cans are not resealable and sharing of such portions is not common. <br/><br/>Because of the similar consumption habits, two 12 fl oz cans sitting side-by-side in a retail store should contain immediately comparable information, regardless of which of the two ABV categories they fall into. If one of those 12 fl oz cans is a craft beer with ABV of 7+% to 16% and the other contains less than 7% ABV, the consumer should be presented with an Alcohol Facts panel display immediately reflecting the differences at the level of the whole can or bottle. That is, they should see that the calories and alcohol content by serving are substantially different. Under TTB&rsquo;s current proposal to apply a 12 fl oz serving size to one can and a 5 fl oz serving size to the other, that would not be the case. The consumer would see information pertaining to the whole container for the lower ABV product and of a minor portion of the higher ABV product. If &ldquo;[s]erving size reference amounts are not intended as recommended consumption amounts but rather are intended to be used as a reference amount for the consumer to determine alcohol, nutrient, and calorie intake&rdquo; (quoting TTB Notice No. 237), then serving sizes should reflect common consumption amounts as they exist in practice.

Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and<br/>educational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of<br/>alcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate a lack of<br/>access to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities, causing them to face<br/>alcohol-related health issues.<br/>Recommendations:<br/>Integrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities that don&rsquo;t have literacy<br/>in English understand the information on the labels. Having alcohol facts panels on labels in<br/>different commonly spoken languages in the US would help people understand it and make<br/>informed health choices.",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,neutral,0.951328456401825,"{'admiration': 0.0008028927841223776, 'amusement': 0.0005432184552773833, 'anger': 0.0010698284022510052, 'annoyance': 0.012714877724647522, 'approval': 0.0891847237944603, 'caring': 0.012976819649338722, 'confusion': 0.002166488440707326, 'curiosity': 0.0009306192514486611, 'desire': 0.0013914428418502212, 'disappointment': 0.03968741372227669, 'disapproval': 0.007992537692189217, 'disgust': 0.0032505723647773266, 'embarrassment': 0.001600919640623033, 'excitement': 0.0002699689648579806, 'fear': 0.010428790003061295, 'gratitude': 0.00026615505339577794, 'grief': 0.0021034139208495617, 'joy': 0.000627585337497294, 'love': 0.000759434828069061, 'nervousness': 0.007508961018174887, 'optimism': 0.009900381788611412, 'pride': 0.0002821442030835897, 'realization': 0.05082320049405098, 'relief': 0.0016751834191381931, 'remorse': 0.0012999754399061203, 'sadness': 0.11294415593147278, 'surprise': 0.0005487198359332979, 'neutral': 0.951328456401825}"

Increased Costs: The new labeling requirements impose significant financial burdens on producers, especially smaller craft brands. These costs stem from redesigning labels, undergoing compliance checks, and possibly halting production to implement new labeling. These expenses are likely to be passed on to consumers, increasing the cost of alcohol products without providing proportional value.<br/><br/>2. Innovation Stifling: Small and mid-sized enterprises, which are often the source of innovation within the industry, may find the cost of compliance prohibitive. This could limit the variety of products available to consumers and stifle the creativity that has driven the industry forward.<br/><br/>3.

Increased Costs: The new labeling requirements impose significant financial burdens on producers, especially smaller craft brands. These costs stem from redesigning labels, undergoing compliance checks, and possibly halting production to implement new labeling. These expenses are likely to be passed on to consumers, increasing the cost of alcohol products without providing proportional value.<br/><br/>2. Innovation Stifling: Small and mid-sized enterprises, which are often the source of innovation within the industry, may find the cost of compliance prohibitive. This could limit the variety of products available to consumers and stifle the creativity that has driven the industry forward.<br/><br/>3.

the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and 
around the world.  ADSA member companies represent over 70 percent of all distilled spirit 
sales nationwide. 
We refer to Wine Institute, DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA 
collectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   
 
The Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in  Notice No. 
237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(“Notice 237”).  The comment period for Notice 237 is scheduled to end on April 17, 2025. 
The Associa tions request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would 
extend to August 15, 2025. 
 
As a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily 
regulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of 
the new administration .  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in 
the final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the 
first day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries 
they regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into 
place since Notice 237 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and 
midsize wineries , c raft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great costs and 
operational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even 
meaningfully participating in  the comment process means they must redirect time and 
resources. 
 
Notice 237 is expansive—i.e., 53 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10-point, single -spaced 
font—and poses more than 90 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It 
is also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that it raises.  
Indeed, it has been over 17 years since TTB last raised these issues and it rightly recognizes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
in Notice 237 that the comments received almost two decades ago “may no longer fully and 
accurately reflect the opinions ” of industry members, trade associations, and other 
interested parties.  We agree with TTB that addressing this issue again years later necessarily 
requires updated input  and add that the beverage alcohol landscape has fundamentally 
evolved over the past 17 years.   That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of 
the proposed rule —including the many questions and requests fo r comments in Notice 
237—and for our members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit 
the overall process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. 
 
It is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 237  will 
impact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance 
of the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey 
the input of all our members to ensure their perspectives are included and well-reflected.  
Moreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 237 on important but sweeping areas of interest 
such as comments on “ any other options available to reduce regulatory burdens and 
economic costs while still providing the consumer with adequate information about the 
products in question .”  Our members will need additional time to consider other options 
available for those purposes and then explain and discuss them in submitted comments. 
 
Last, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that 
impact our members.  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing major food 
allergen labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same day as Notice 
237 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 237’s publication , 
the FDA published a rulemaking proposing front-of-package labeling for nutrition which will 
also impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 237, propose new 
rules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration.  We therefore believe a 
120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. 
 
We would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request.

  De  Maison  Selections  Inc.  is  a  small  business  with  20  employees  that  imports  fine  wine,  cider,  
and
 
spirits
 
from
 
small,
 
family-run
 
wineries
 
in
 
France
 
and
 
Spain.
 
We
 
are
 
commenting
 
on
 
the
 
questions
 
the
 
TTB
 
posed
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
rulemaking
 
notice.
   
  Overall  Comment  on  Proposed  Rulemaking:  Although  there  has  been  little  to  no  demand  for  nutritional  information  from  our  distributors  and  
consumers,
 
we
 
understand
 
the
 
motivations
 
behind
 
the
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
statement
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.
 
Complying
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
would
 
require
 
us
 
to
 
incur
 
upfront
 
costs
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
time
 
and
 
money;
 
however,
 
we
 
appreciate
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
flexibility
 
regarding
 
nutrition
 
labeling,
 
COLA
 
approval,
 
thresholds,
 
and
 
nutrition
 
testing.
 
While
 
we
 
value
 
the
 
TTB's
 
allowance
 
for
 
the
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
label
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
linearly,
 
utilizing
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
would
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
update
 
information
 
and
 
align
 
with
 
EU
 
labeling
 
protocols.
 
We
 
are
 
thankful
 
for
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
implementation
 
of
 
a
 
five-year
 
period,
 
which
 
will
 
save
 
time
 
and
 
money
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
run.
 
Despite
 
the
 
potential
 
cost
 
savings,
 
the
 
new
 
labeling
 
requirement
 
would
 
impose
 
a
 
minimum
 
expense
 
of
 
$818,260
 
on
 
our
 
company.
 
Thus,
 
this
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
would
 
still
 
present
 
challenges
 
for
 
small
 
importers
 
and
 
producers.
 
Many
 
small
 
foreign
 
producers
 
struggle
 
to
 
comprehend
 
US
 
regulations
 
and
 
requirements,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
communicate
 
them
 
accurately
 
and
 
precisely
 
to
 
their
 
production
 
partners.
 
This
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
numerous
 
errors
 
in
 
attempts
 
at
 
compliance,
 
resulting
 
in
 
lost
 
time
 
and
 
resources.
 
We
 
estimate
 
that
 
fulfilling
 
the
 
proposed
 
regulations
 
will
 
increase
 
production
 
and
 
transit
 
times,
 
as
 
producers
 
must
 
invest
 
time
 
and
 
resources
 
to
 
meet
 
these
 
new
 
requirements.

  Alcohol  Facts  Labeling   The  back  label  of  a  wine  or  spirit  is  valuable  real  estate  that  includes  what  consumers  desire,  such  as  the  terroir,  grape  varieties,  and  the  technical  skills  of  the  winemaker  (Bettaglene,  2014).  Including  alcohol  facts  on  the  back  label  reduces  space  for  these  attributes  and  may  hinder  
small
 
wine
 
producers'
 
ability
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
consumers.
 
We
 
recognize
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
consumers
 
are
 
wine
 
connoisseurs;
 
however,
 
consumers
 
may
 
be
 
inclined
 
to
 
purchase
 
a
 
product
 
if
 
the
 producer  shares  an  authentic  story,  fostering  trust  with  specific  regions  and  producers  (Tortolero  Cervantes,  2023).  With  the  increasing  requirement  for  warning  statements  and  sulfite  content,  a  QR  code  or  linear  Alcohol  Facts  label  would  allow  producers  to  showcase  important  attributes  
consumers
 
want
 
while
 
providing
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
and
 
allergens.
 
  Linear  Alcohol  Facts  Statement:    We  oppose  the  back  label’s  nutrient  statement  aligning  with  the  nutrition  facts  label  found  on  
foods
 
under
 
the
 
FDA’s
 
labeling
 
jurisdiction.
 
Eighteen
 
percent
 
of
 
individuals
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
read
 
wine
 
labels;
 
among
 
those
 
who
 
do,
 
shorter
 
ingredient
 
lists
 
or
 
clean-labeled
 
wines
 
without
 
listed
 ingredients  are  preferred  (Pabst  et  al.,  2021).  Therefore,  we  endorse  the  linear  label,  which  contains  all  the  information  required  by  the  TTB  while  also  allowing  for  listing  wine  attributes.   QR  Codes:    We  advocate  using  QR  codes  on  labels,  enabling  consumers  to  access  mandatory  Alcohol  
Facts
 
statements
 
and
 
allergen
 
information
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
devices.
 
QR
 
codes
 
are
 
also
 
required
 
in
 
the
 
EU,
 
and
 
producers
 
can
 
include
 
the
 
US
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
regulations
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
webpage,
 
thereby
 
reducing
 
the
 
regulatory
 
burden
 
on
 
these
 
small
 
businesses.
 
  Commenters  noted  that  not  everyone  has  a  cell  phone,  particularly  those  over  65,  and  that  tribal  
lands
 
and
 
rural
 
areas
 
often
 
lack
 
sufficient
 
4G
 
LTE
 
coverage.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
FCC
 
Broadband
 
Data
 
Collection,
 
as
 
of
 
June
 
30,
 
2024,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
US
 
has
 
between
 
40%
 
and
 
100%
 
access
 
to
 
4G
 LTE  data  ( FCC  National  Broadband  Map ,  2025).  The  STARLINK  availability  map  reveals  that  most  of  the  US  (>=99%),  even  in  rural  areas,  has  access  to  high-speed  internet  ( Starlink ,  2025).  Therefore,  consumers  will  likely  access  QR  codes  on  their  mobile  devices  within  five  years.  In  
2023,
 
97%
 
of
 
18-49-year-olds
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
and
 
89%
 
of
 
those
 
aged
 
50-64
 
owned
 
one.
 
Although
 
only
 
76%
 
of
 
individuals
 
aged
 
65
 
and
 
older
 
owned
 
a
 
smartphone,
 
this
 
trend
 
has
 increased  from  46%  in  2018  to  61%  in  2021  ( Smartphone  Ownership  in  the  US  by  Age  2023 ,  2025).  Across  all  age  groups,  smartphone  ownership  is  on  the  rise,  and  this  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  coming  years.  Thus,  the  commenters'  concerns  about  the  lack  of  smartphone  
ownership
 
and
 
coverage
 
are
 
unfounded.
  Labeling  Requirements  and  Competition:   As  a  small  business  importing  wine  and  distilled  spirits  from  family-owned  vineyards,  these  new  
requirements
 
will
 
increase
 
costs
 
for
 
our
 
business
 
and
 
foreign
 
producers.
 
We
 
applaud
 
the
 
TTB’s
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
FDA
 
Labeling
 
Cost
 
Model
 
to
 
estimate
 
a
 
per
 
UPC
 
price
 
for
 
label
 
redesign
 
for
 
wine
 
and
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
finding
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
$1,636.52
 
per
 
UPC
 
fair.
 
However,
 
we
 
must
 
hire
 
another
 
employee
 
to
 
manage
 
graphic
 
design,
 
web
 
development,
 
and
 
data
 
analytics
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
new
 
requirements.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
incur
 
costs
 
for
 
health
 
insurance,
 
training,
 
and
 
benefits
 
for
 
the
 
new
 
hire.
 
With
 
between
 
400
 
and
 
500
 
UPCs,
 
our
 
minimum
 
costs
 
would
 
range
 
from
 
$654,608
 
to
 
$818,260,
 
which
 
may
 
limit
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
sell
 
wine
 
and
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
market.
 
We
 
commend
 
the
 
TTB
 
for
 
not
 
requiring
 
a
 
new
 
COLA,
 
allowing
 
thresholds,
 
and
 
permitting
 
one-time
 
testing
 
of
 
each
 
product.
 
  Implementation  Period:    We  agree  with  the  five-year  implementation  period.  This  will  provide  our  producers  sufficient  
time
 
to
 
use
 
existing
 
labels
 
and
 
print
 
new
 
ones
 
with
 
alcohol
 
facts.
 
The
 
number
 
of
 
labels
 
the
 
producer
 
has
 
printed
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
the
 
final
 
rule
 
is
 
established
 
will
 
determine
 
if
 
our
 
compliance
 
period
 
is
 
shorter
 
than
 
five
 
years.

Consumer confusion has been identified in prior rulemaking and, notably, in this scenario, dietary disclosure lacks demonstrable necessity.  People do not consume alcohol for nutritional content, and to suggest otherwise may be at cross purposes to regulations that support responsible alcohol consumption.   Proscriptions can avoid market deceptions.  Absent a documented market failure, dietary labeling mandates violate rules of necessity (APA &sect;706(2)(A). <br/><br/>2.  The economic burden of dietary testing and compliance, particularly considering limited editions, seasonal variations, and batch variations, would be disproportionately borne by small businesses in an industry of aggressive consolidative pressures and marketing obstacles.   Small businesses cannot offset recurrent costs through economies of scale. Further, this cost overrun undermines the public benefit, such as through less consumer choice and signal noise.  The proposal has not considered less burdensome alternatives such as voluntary and QR disclosures. <br/><br/>3. The proposed rule disrupts established conventions to use limited label space, responsible free speech, and aesthetics. Signals must relate to qualifiers that aid consumers in making informed choices about product differentiation.   Consumers may not object to the abstract idea of dietary information on a label; however, they look to qualifiers such as region, source ingredients, production methods, and sustainability. The proposed rule would, therefore, conflict with the comprehensive labeling framework (27 CFR 4.32&mdash;4.39). Additional label information would unintentionally increase container sizes.<br/><br/>4.  Alcohol consumption is declining significantly among Gen Z.  Regulatory cues that accentuate limited dietary benefits would reinforce avoidance behaviors, shift comparison to dietary content of non-alcoholic alternatives, diminish the stated benefits of the regulation, and may represent regulatory overreach.

2 of 4Comments from P. R. China on United States Notification
G/TBT/N/USA/2182
1. The draft regulation required all alcohol beverage labels regulated by TTB to
disclose the alcohol content, calories, and nutritional information of each beverage in
the ""alcohol content"" statement. Due to the fact that alcoholic beverages are mainly
composed of ethanol and water, and do not contain conventional nutrients such as
protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc., for example, distilled spirits almost do not contain
these components. If the product does not add nutritional fortifiers or make nutritional
claims, labeling the nutritional content table is meaningless; Fermented alcoholic
beverages (such as beer and fruit wine) may contain small amounts of carbohydrates,
and it may consider adding only labeled carbohydrates as appropriate. However, beer
labels also require labeling malt content, therefore, labeling carbohydrates is not very
meaningful for consumers. For ordinary consumers, the nutritional value of alcoholic
beverages is limited, and labeling indicators such as carbohydrates may be misleading
(such as implying that they have nutritional supplementation functions). The
additional and unnecessary laboratory analysis costs incurred are also a heavy burden
for producers or traders.
According to the relevant standards of the CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission),
most countries do not require the labeling of conventional nutrients such as protein,
fat, carbohydrates, etc. for alcoholic beverages. The provision of Regulation (EU) No
1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Provision of Food
Information to Consumers concerning the ingredient list and nutrition declaration for
alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content exceeding 1.2% is non-mandatory. When
the nutrition statement for alcoholic beverages is voluntarily provided, it is limited to
energy values only.
Based on the principle of scientific evidence and necessity, it is recommended that the
United States should coordinate its requirements for alcoholic beverage labeling with
international standards, or differentiated the requirements according to the different
product forms of alcoholic beverages: consider not mandating the labeling of
conventional nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc. on ordinary alcoholic
beverage labels as appropriate; If additional ingredients such as sugar, juice, or other
nutritional enhancers are added to alcoholic beverages, the carbohydrate content or
other nutrient content may be indicated according to the actual situation. To avoid
excessive regulation, reduce compliance costs for businesses, and alleviate the burden
on small and medium-sized enterprises.
2. The draft regulation required the addition of new subpart L - alcohol factual
statements in Parts 4, 5, and 7 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
The current regulations require the display of information such as alcohol content,
carmine, sulfite, etc. The proposed rule required an addition of alcohol factual
statements such as single portion size, number of portions per container, and liquid
ounces per unit of pure ethanol, and the liquid ounce information per unit of pure
ethanol should be accurate to one tenth of the liquid ounce. The provision differs from
international standards and may impose additional costs and burdens on alcoholic
beverage manufacturers and importers, especially small businesses. It is
recommended that the United States should maintain the current regulations without
3 of 4adding the provision and not mandating the labeling of information such as ""single
portion size, number of portions per container, and number of ounces of pure ethanol
per serving"" to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade.
Comments in Chinese are as below:
1、 规章修订提案中要求所有受TTB 监管的酒精饮料标签“酒精含量”声明
中必须披露每份饮料的酒精含量、 卡路里及营养成分信息。 由于酒精饮料的主要
成分为乙醇和水， 基本不含蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素，比如蒸馏
酒几乎不含这些成分， 若产品未添加营养强化剂或未进行营养声称， 则标示营养
成分表毫无意义；发酵酒（如啤酒、果酒）可能含有少量碳水化合物，可以酌情
考虑仅添加标示碳水化合物， 但啤酒标签也已要求标注麦芽度， 因此标示碳水化
合物对于消费者也无太大意义。对普通消费者而言，酒精饮料的营养价值有限，
标注碳水化合物等指标可能产生误导（如暗示其具有营养补充功能） 。其产生额
外的、不必要的实验室分析费用对生产商或贸易商来说也是繁重的负担。
根据食品法典委员会的相关标准， 国际上绝大多数国家对酒精饮料不强制要
求标注蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物等常规营养素。欧盟（EU）第 1169/2011 号条
例《关于向消费者提供食品信息》涉及酒精含量超过 1.2%的酒精饮料提供成分
清单、营养声明的规定属于非强制性条款，当酒精饮料营养声明是自愿提供时，
营养声明仅限于能量值。
本着科学性与必要性， 建议美方对酒精饮料标签的要求与国际标准协调一致，
也可根据酒精饮料的不同产品形式区分要求： 酌情考虑不强制普通酒精饮料标签
标注蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素； 若酒精饮料中额外添加了糖、果
汁等配料， 或使用其他营养强化剂的， 可根据实际情况要求标示碳水化合物含量
或其他营养素含量。以避免过度监管，降低企业合规成本与中小企业的负担。
2、规章修订提案中要求在《美国联邦法规》第27 篇第 4、5、7 部分中分别
增加新的子部分 L——酒精事实陈述条款。 现行法规已要求显示酒精含量、 胭脂
红、 亚硫酸盐等信息， 该拟议规则要求增加单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯
乙醇的液体盎司数等酒精事实声明， 且每份纯乙醇的液体盎司信息需精确到液体
盎司的十分之一。 该条款与国际通行标准存在差异， 会给酒精饮料制造商和进口
商， 特别是小企业带来额外的成本和负担。 建议美方维持现行法规， 不增加该条
款， 不强制要求标示 “单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯乙醇的液盎司数”等
信息，以避免对贸易造成不必要的障碍。

SENT VIA ONLINE PUBLIC COMMENT 
SUBJECT: Support for Mandatory Nutrition and Ingredient Labeling on Alcoholic Beverages  
Dear TTB Administrator, 
I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed rules requiring standardized nutrition 
and ingredient labeling on alcoholic beverages (Docket Nos. TTB–2025–0002 and TTB–2025–0003). 
This issue is especially meaningful to me on a personal level. Over the past three years, I have 
undergone a major transformation in my health and lifestyle, losing over 100 pounds through 
deliberate choices and a commitment to understanding the nutritional content of what I consume. 
After years of struggling with my weight and related health issues, I’ve learned ﬁrsthand how crucial 
transparent labeling is in making informed, health-conscious decisions. 
Alcohol is often part of our culture, tied to celebrations and social occasions. I do not want to avoid 
these moments; I simply want to be able to make informed decisions when I participate in them. 
Unfortunately, unlike nearly every other consumable product, alcohol is not required to disclose 
basic information such as calories, ingredients, or allergens. This lack of transparency is unfair, 
outdated, and out of step with consumer expectations and health needs. 
I strongly urge the TTB to move forward with ﬁnalizing these proposals and to require full ingredient, 
nutrition, and allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages for several key reasons: 
1. Empowering Health-Conscious Consumers – People like me who are managing their 
health need accurate nutritional information to make intentional choices. This information 
is essential—not optional—for supporting long-term health. 
2. Consumer Right to Know – It is only reasonable that consumers be given the same level of 
transparency for alcohol as is provided for food, soda, or even bottled water. We deserve to 
know what’s in the products we consume. 
3. Safety and Allergen Disclosure – Hidden ingredients and allergens can pose real dangers. 
Requiring full disclosure helps protect individuals with dietary restrictions, allergies, or 
intolerances. 
4. Public Demand – The majority of Americans support this change. Transparency builds 
trust, supports public health, and aligns with the growing demand for cleaner, more 
informed choices. 
Consumers deserve clarity, safety, and the ability to make deliberate decisions about their health - 
especially in a product category as widely consumed as alcohol. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for your work on this important initiative. 
Sincerely, 
Jessica Block

Re: Docket ID No. TTB-2025-0002, Proposed Rule – Alcohol Beverage Labeling Requirements 
(Alcohol Facts Statement)
Position and Background of the Regulation:
I am writing in strong support of the proposed regulation TTB-20205-0002 issued by the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau which mandated the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” panel on 
labels of distilled spirits, wines and malt beverages across the United States.1 As a Master of 
Public Health student, I believe this regulation is a crucial step towards improving consumer’s 
health literacy about risks of excessive alcohol consumption, enables them to make informed 
health decisions, and reduce alcohol-related harm to health.1 This proposed regulation requires 
labels to include per-serving information such as alcohol content, calorie count, serving size and 
basic nutritional information.1 These changes are long overdue and reflect public health best 
practices. Importantly, this regulation is at the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) stage 
which invites public comments prior to finalization.1 As a student studying public health policy, I 
realize that this phase is a vital opportunity for stakeholders, public, researchers and 
professionals to shape regulations that directly impact the health and lives of people.1 Public 
commenting is not just a democratic mechanism but it is a critical tool that aligns regulatory 
actions with evidence and equity.
Health Risks of Alcohol Consumption:
Road traffic accidents are a pressing public health issue in the US with 32 people dying of 
automobile crashes each year involving alcohol impaired driving accounting for 1 death in every 
45 minutes.2 According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), driving 
under influence deaths were highest among young individuals aged 21 to 24 yrs (29%) and 25-34 
yrs (28%).3 Excessive consumption of alcohol causes 178,000 deaths each year in the US, and 
leads to chronic heart and liver diseases, stroke, digestive issues, cancer and weakened immune 
system.4,5 It also has caused shorter life span leading individuals to die by an average of 24 
years.4 Effective regulations like TTB-2025-0002 can help reduce deaths by making people 
choose to limit their alcohol consumption.4 
Evidence-Based Impact of Labelling Alcoholic Beverages:
According to Vasiljevic, M. et al. (2018), a randomized controlled trial found that when 
alcoholic beverages are labeled with clear information about Alcohol by Volume (ABV), and 
amount of pure alcohol content per serving, individuals aged 18-40 years, social and non-
dependent drinkers are significantly less likely to select high strength drinks.6 These finds show 
that quantitative labels of alcoholic drinks reduces the appeal to strong alcoholic beverages 
especially among individuals with low literacy levels about the risks of alcohol consumption, and 
groups that are at an elevated risk of binge drinking and impaired driving.6 Another study done by Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), conducted a national survey with an aim to 
receive consumer’s opinion about transparency in labeling alcoholic beverages with information 
such as calories, serving size, nutritional content, and alcohol content, that are a part of the 
regulation, TTB-2025-0002, along with other alcohol facts.7 The sample for the survey was 
nationally representative with US adults from all demographics.7 This study found that 63% to 
77% respondents supported policies that required the inclusion of nutrition and alcohol content 
information on the labels of alcoholic beverages, either somewhat or strongly.7 Whereas, 72% to 
90% respondents supported having more information on the labels as it would impact their 
choice to purchase alcohol.7 A systematic review done in the UK also shows moderate evidence 
of labeling calories and ABV on purchasing choices of consumers showing increased preference 
for alcoholic beverages with calorie count labels, and reduction in purchase of high calorie 
alcohol.8 While there is not much research done on evaluating the direct impact of labeling on 
“Driving While Intoxicated” (DWI) and alcohol related health issues among people in the US, 
the above evidence-based research shows the psychological impact of labelling on consumers 
purchasing and alcoholic beverage choices based on content, that in turn suggests an increase in 
consumer awareness about alcohol risks and a reduction in driving under influence and health 
issue prevalence due to alcohol consumption.6,7,8 While labeling alcoholic beverages alone 
cannot eliminate the issue of impaired driving, it can be a valuable evidence-informed strategy to 
complement other policy tools such as age limits, taxes and enforcement to help people make 
informed health choices.9
Addressing Health Equity:
Standardized “Alcohol Facts” panel on labels of alcoholic beverages would be an equitable and 
low cost strategy in bridging information gap.10 Rural and low-income communities often lack 
access to resources and education.11 Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and 
educational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of 
alcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate lack of 
access to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities causing them to face 
alcohol-related health issues.
Recommendations:
Integrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities who don’t have literacy 
in English understand the information on the labels. Having alcohol facts panels on labels in 
different commonly spoken languages in the US would help people understand it and make 
informed health choices.
Conclusion:
I commend the proposed regulation, TTB-2025-0002, as it supports evidence based strategies. 
The nation has witnessed horrifying incidences such as the case of Jacqueline Saburido, who had 
to suffer from third degree burns due to her car being hit by a heavily intoxicated.13 The people 
of our country must never have to go through such experiences. TTB-2025-0002 can make this 
happen. Therefore, I request the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to immediately 
finalize and implement the regulation to protect the lives and health of all communities in the 
United States.1 TTB-2025-0002 ensures equity, helps alcohol risk communication and reduces 
alcohol-related harm.1References

Re: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
(Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) 
 
To Whom it May Concern, 
 
The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. Founded in 
1928, ASN is the nation’s leading society for nutrition research and practice, representing more 
than 8,000 professional members across 100 countries. Our members – including nutrition 
scientists, physicians, dietitians, and other stakeholders – are dedicated to advancing our mission 
of “A Healthier World Through Evidence-Based Nutrition.” ASN supports the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) efforts to implement labeling of alcohol content and 
nutritional information on alcoholic beverages, as this will impart important information to 
consumers that they need to make informed health and nutrition-related purchases and decisions. 
 
The “Alcohol Facts” panel in the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a 
percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the 
number of calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.” 
This information is important to promote transparency regarding the contents of alcoholic 
beverages, and to highlight health and safety information for those who consume alcohol. 
Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after 
tobacco and obesity, increasing risk for at least seven types of cancer
1. Alcoholic beverages can 
be calorie-dense and therefore contribute to diet-related chronic diseases. On average, alcohol 
accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.2 Many alcoholic beverages also contain 
added sugars and other nutrients to limit. 
 
As such, the proposed rule could be strengthened by also requiring additional nutritional content, 
including total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in 
milligrams, and a percent Daily Value for each of these nutrients based on a 2,000-calorie diet. 
 
 
1 Alcohol and Cancer Risk 2025: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory. US Department of Health and Human 
Services, Office of the Surgeon General. January 3, 2025. 
2 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.   
 
The final rule should also require the number of standard drinks per container (instead of the 
proposed number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), and the conversion between 
standard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. TTB may also consider dual-column 
labeling for certain alcoholic beverages for those that are customarily consumed in one sitting. 
This label has two columns, one for listing the nutritional facts related to a single serving and one 
listing the nutritional facts for the contents of the entire package. 
 
ASN supports the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on 
alcoholic beverage packages and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a 
webpage), as this would specifically disadvantage populations that may be less likely to utilize 
technology to gain this important health and safety information.  
 
ASN urges TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts 
rule to ensure that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to 
drink. To ensure timely consumer access to this important information, the final rule should 
adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed. 
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration of the American Society for Nutrition’s comments 
on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
Please contact Sarah Ohlhorst, MS, RD, ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer 
(sohlhorst@nutrition.org; 240-428-3647) for more information. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John E. Courtney, PhD 
Chief Executive Officer

I welcome this discussion. However, I don&rsquo;t think the change in label requirements will have the desired effects proponents want. I think there will be significant unintended consequences that do not benefit the consumer and burden the manufacturer. <br/><br/>1. Most products could go into containers (boxes, wraps, etc&hellip;) that the TTB is unauthorized to regulate. Access to label information will only be available after purchase<br/>2. Increase cost to the consumer <br/>3. Less variety on store shelves<br/>4. Less craft manufacturers, more corporate manufacturers <br/>5. Average consumer may not know how to accurately read and interpet the label&#39;s nutrional information <br/>6. Using a QR code will result in additional personal data collection<br/>7. Wasted time: Scan QR code in grocery store, wait minutes for manufacturer website to load, confirm age, wait minutes for nutritional information page to load, read and interpret information. Repeat X amount times when comparing brands.<br/><br/>Proponents of this rule change are projecting their loftiest ideals on how they think the average consumer will behave. The average consumer spends single digit seconds selecting products in the grocery or convenience store.

Comments on Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages. 
 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
To Whom It May Concern,  
We are writing on behalf of the ""Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C."" (CIVYL), 
the united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of 
wines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, Casa 
Cuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and Pernod 
Ricard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and implementation 
of public policies related to alcoholic beverages. 
Firstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and 
contribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is 
dedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of 
alcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately 
inform consumers without causing confusion. 
In this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code 
of Federal Regulations under Notice No. 237, which would mandate the inclusion of an ""Alcohol 
Facts"" panel on the labeling of alcoholic beverages. 
We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect consumers. However, we believe 
that requiring the inclusion of nutritional information on labeling may not provide significant benefits to 
consumers as the primary objective of alcoholic beverage labeling, from a public health perspective, is to 
promote responsible alcohol consumption and prevent harmful alcohol use. Including nutritional 
information on these beverages may create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" 
potentially leading to consumer confusion. 
Alcohol should not be considered a product that provides nutrients to the consumer. Including 
nutritional information on labels could mislead consumers into believing that alcoholic beverages are part 
of a balanced diet or provide essential nutrients. This could influence purchasing decisions in a way that 
diverts attention from critical aspects such as alcohol content. Additionally, comparing the 
nutritional values of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages may be misleading, as their 
characteristics and intended purposes are fundamentally different. Factors such as caloric content, 
carbohydrates, sugars, or fats in alcoholic beverages should not be equated with those of conventional 
foods, given that alcohol itself is the primary differentiating component. In Mexico, legislation prohibits 
alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits, as well as therapeutic, curative, or 
rehabilitative properties. 
In Mexico, according to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising for these products must be 
limited to informing them about their characteristics, quality, and production techniques, without 
presenting them as sources of well-being or health. Furthermore, Article 307 states that the advertising 
of food and non-alcoholic beverages should not be directly or indirectly associated with the consumption 
of alcoholic beverages nor induce harmful eating habits. Lastly, Article 6 of the General Health Law 
Regulations on Advertising establishes that product advertising must not attribute preventive, 
therapeutic, rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or other qualities to them. This reinforces the 
prohibition of attributing nutritional value or properties that do not correspond to alcoholic beverages. 
Rather than being useful, these statements could directly cause consumer confusion. 
 
 
 
  
Furthermore, implementing this measure would represent an additional cost for manufacturers, 
importers, and distributors of alcoholic beverages. This would contravene Article 2.2 of the WTO 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which prohibits imposing technical regulations that 
create unnecessary obstacles to international trade without a justification based on legitimate 
objectives of member states. We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect 
consumers. However, we believe that the labeling requirement should be limited to declaring only the 
alcohol content. 
Considering all the above, we respectfully request that the implementation of this modification 
regarding the inclusion of the “Alcohol Facts” panel be reconsidered, as it may not provide 
significant additional benefits to consumers and could, instead, lead to unintended confusion 
regarding the nature and nutritional value of alcoholic beverages and it must be limited to 
declaring only the alcohol content. Additionally, increasing regulatory and financial burdens on 
producers, in particular small and medium-sized ones. 
However, if the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel is approved, it is recommended that the 
information should be allowed to be presented through electronic labeling (QR code, digital platform, or 
website). This approach would facilitate access to information without imposing unnecessary regulatory 
or commercial burdens. 
This tool offers the following advantages: 
• Unlimited information space for consumers. 
• Provides consumers with more information in a user-friendly and easily understandable 
format.  
• Easily accommodates changes in regulatory provisions. 
• Allows information to reach one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent 
excessive and harmful alcohol use.  
 
The above is consistent with the "" Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food Information 
in Food Labelling”, which is being developed within the framework of the Codex Alimentarius Labeling 
Committee. 
Finally, if this requirement is implemented, a gradual implementation period of five years would be the 
best way to adopt such measures, allowing small producers to modify their supply chain for distribution 
in the U.S. 
For these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less 
burdensome solutions. 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Panambí Garcés 
General Manager

RIN 1513-AC93



Dear Reviewer,



Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed mandatory alcohol facts statement labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. I offer these comments as a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to specific requests for comment.



Title of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”

Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?

Are consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?

Alternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?



In many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts and dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to as “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is presented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the term “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol Facts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by seeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on a non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently providing alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. 



Mandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information

Should TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?

For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?

Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?

Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?

Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? 


Some aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include calories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily value for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars or other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to allow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for calories, fat, etc. 

I think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks cited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense balance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently giving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  

From personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving of alcohol and what constitutes a serving. Having alcohol facts available is useful in making choices to maintain healthy weights and consume responsibly. 

Calculating Panel Elements & Tolerance Levels

TTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still specific enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Specifically, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set.

TTB should be mindful of tolerances that are so exact that it would cause undue financial burden to small operations to comply with little benefit to public health. I agree with the approach TTB is proposing.

Mandatory Listing of Alcohol Content by volume on Malt Beverages

Should TTB require alcohol content statement on a beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act, but is subject to the IRC? 

Should TTB increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the statement amount for all malt beverage and beers? This would alleviate the need for expensive specialized equipment needed to test for alcohol content to a sufficient degree of certainty to meet the current tolerance standards. Would consumers receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance is increased? 

Should TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as the statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume?

Yes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements on beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act. Most consumers do not understand the regulatory distinction, so not seeing alcohol content on some products would be confusing and implementing the requirements “across the board” provides parity among producers. 

On the matter of increasing labeling tolerances, as long as the tolerance is backed with evidence that shows that consumers would not suffer harm if the alcohol content was one percentage point higher than what is stated on a product, I support the proposal. A proposal that would require purchase of expensive equipment to test alcohol content for certainty if there is no public health reason makes no sense and only serves to reduce competition in the marketplace. 

I agree with TTB’s proposal to require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages and a statement that adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume. 

Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of Alcohol Facts Statement

Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?

Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?



As a consumer, I do not feel strongly as to whether the alcohol content information is located on the Alcohol Facts statement or elsewhere on the label. However, I believe there should be a designated place where the information is required with options to provide it elsewhere (in addition) if a producer would like to include it as part of the label elsewhere. I think since the labels are changing so drastically, consumers should get used to finding important information in one spot on the container. By allowing the option to provide the information in more than one place, if producers have front of container labels that contain ABV, they would not need to redesign and reprint those labels in addition to having to comply with Alcohol Facts and/or allergen labeling requirements. 



Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving

TTB proposes to amend the regulations to require the listing of the number of U.S. fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, expressed to the nearest tenth of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume statement.

Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?

Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?

TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.

Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines' advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?

TTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and regulatory burdens.

The public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. 



Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

Linear Display

Though this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be reasonable for certain containers. 

Type Size

Unless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. 

Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information

While it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important information to consumers. 

Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display

Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?

Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?

These are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have intended. 

Once again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of alcohol beverages.

of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the 
information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume 
statement.
2. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per 
serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers 
to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and 
health agencies, if they so choose?
3. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? 
Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or 
in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?
4. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms 
“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of 
those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.
5. Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of 
the Dietary Guidelines' advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any 
changes in the guidelines over time)?
6. TTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide 
useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and 
whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and 
regulatory burdens.
The public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that 
many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When 
thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an 
alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required 
information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with 
information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to 
consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers 
understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. 
Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information
A. Linear Display
Though this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be 
reasonable for certain containers. 
B. Type Size
Unless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility 
and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. 
C. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts InformationWhile it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory 
requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label 
does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I 
reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the 
state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We 
are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important 
information to consumers. 
Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display
1. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple 
servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?
2. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer 
servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five 
servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and 
labeled?
These are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels 
because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three 
or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric 
content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a 
case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a 
recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be 
more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention 
that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have 
intended. 
Once again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to 
provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of 
alcohol beverages.

Facts” Labeling Rule 
To: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
Re: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002 – Proposed Rule on Alcohol Facts Labeling 
I am writing to express my support for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s 
proposed rule to mandate an “Alcohol Facts” label on alcoholic beverage products. The proposed 
label would require the disclosure of per-serving alcohol content, calorie count, and nutrient 
information. This action is long overdue and urgently needed, as it represents an important step 
toward improving public health, enhancing consumer transparency, and encouraging more 
informed and responsible alcoholic consumption. I respectfully urge the TTB to adopt this rule 
and to maintain the proposed five-year compliance period as it is both practical and reasonable 
for industry application. 
There are several compelling reasons as to why mandatory alcohol facts labeling should be 
implemented. 
1. Enhancing Consumer Protection by Implementing Beverage Transparency  
One of the most important public health justifications for this rule is the urgent 
need for transparency regarding the composition and nutrition of alcoholic beverages. 
Unlike packages foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
alcoholic beverages regulated by the TTB are not currently required to include nutrition 
labels. While the reasoning for this stems from decisions made in the 1930s, these 
policies are outdated and no longer align with modern consumer expectations or health 
priorities.1  
The absence of transparency means that consumers continue to be unaware of 
ingredients that could pose health risks, especially for those with allergies and dietary 
restrictions. Many people are unaware that alcoholic beverages can contain sulfites, 
artificial colors, sweeteners, preservatives, or grains that may cause adverse reactions.2 A 
product that was once safe to consume may change formulations without the consumer’s 
knowledge. This lack of labeling creates unnecessary risk for individuals with food 
sensitivities or health conditions. While this proposed rule does not address allergen 
disclosure, like that of Docket No. TTB-2025-0003,3 it lays the foundation for consumer 
transparency among alcoholic beverages. Additionally, this rule supports health equity by

informed choices.  
2. Promoting Nutritional Awareness 
Alcoholic beverages are a significant source of “hidden” calories. Without 
labeling, many individuals unknowingly exceed their recommended daily intake for 
calories or sugar through alcohol consumption alone. For example, a 1.5 ounce shot of 
hard liquor contains anywhere from 100 to 120 calories and that is before any mixers are 
added.4  
Requiring calorie and nutrient content labeling would encourage consumers to 
better track their intake and make more intentional decisions that correspond to their 
health goals. In a society that is increasingly focused on improving their health and 
preventing disease, transparency among consumed alcohol is essential. Emerging studies 
have revealed an association between alcohol consumption and obesity.5 Thus, 
transparency in labeling can contribute to nutritional awareness among consumers and 
support more conscious drinking habits. 
3. Reducing Risky Consumption and Binge Drinking Through Informed Choices 
Transparent alcohol labeling also plays a critical role in preventing 
overconsumption and binge drinking. According to the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), binge drinking is defined as consuming five or more 
drinks for males or four or more for females within a two-hour period.6 However, without 
clear labeling of alcohol content and serving size, many individuals underestimate the 
amount of alcohol within a beverage, particularly with ready to drink cocktails or 
oversized containers. 
Studies have shown that alcohol labeling can influence drinking behavior and 
reduce the intentions to drink alcohol.7 More accurate labeling could encourage 
moderation and promote responsible drinking habits, especially among casual drinkers or 
younger consumers who may not be aware of the recommended limits. By implementing 
a label, consumers would be able to gauge how much they are actually consuming, which 
could potentially reduce binge drinking. 
The proposed alcohol facts labeling rule is a critical step towards improving consumer 
transparency, health equity, and public safety. This change would bring the labeling standard of 
alcoholic beverages to that of the same caliber of the labeling for food and non-alcoholic 
beverages, thus allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding their health. This rule 
also fosters accountability and transparency. Additionally, the proposed five-year compliance

public health measure.

USA - Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
 
Notice of proposed rulemaking: Alcohol Facts Statements in 
the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (“BNIC”) is a private institution financed by the Cognac 
professionals (producers and trade houses) and entrusted with public service missions. The objectives of 
BNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all 
Cognac stakeholders overall. 
 
On 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in 
the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring the disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, 
and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to 
TTB’s regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.  
 
On TTB’s request for comments regarding the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” 
(both are currently being considered by the TTB): 
BNIC is favorable for the use of the title “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”. Indeed, the 
information included in the proposal refers to nutritional information in a serving of an alcoholic beverage 
which will be specific to the beverage in quest ion, rather than information on alcohol. Therefore, the title 
“Alcohol Facts” could be misleading or a cause of confusion for consumers.  
 
On TTB’s display proposals: 
Labeling space is limited and in efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of labeling (printing, use of ink etc.) 
it is desirable to limit the information which is printed out. Therefore,   
- BNIC s trongly u rges the TTB to authorize the use of digital means to display the nutritional 
statement. Authorizing the use of digital tools would present many advantages. Firstly, this would 
save space on the label itself, reducing the use of paper, glue and ink to print the labels. Secondly, 
it would allow industry members to share further information with consumers about the product, 
i.e. the production process, list of ingredients, health and responsible consumption guidelines,

packaging collection and sorting details and sustainability information. Digital tools such as QR 
codes also allow for the information to be easily shared in different languages, allowing a greater 
number of consumers to understand and have readily access to information on the product. Finally, 
digital tools also for easy updates, low compliance costs and avoid label waste which allows 
businesses to update their labels with minimal cost incurred. In the European Union, the wine 
industry must only include the number of calories per 100ml on the bottle, with further information 
such as energy values and the list of ingredients being readily available via a QR Code in all 24 
official languages of the European Union. This is very important for the alcoholic beverages sector 
which is made up of largely exported products.   
- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly urges the TTB to remove the black box around the 
declaration which will unnecessarily use up space on the label. Removing the black box will allow 
industry members more flexibility on the presentation of the required information.  
- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly u rges the TTB to authorize a linear display on all 
bottles, regardless of their content. A linear display, rather than a columned table display, will allow 
industry members to save space on their labels and offer them more flexibility in the declaration 
presentation.   
 
On TTB’s proposal regarding the information to be included in the declaration:  
- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to allow sugar content statements to remain as an optional 
element. This flexibility will allow industry members the possibility to align as much as possible 
with international practices regarding this matter. For example, in E urope, many spirit industry 
members voluntarily disclose additional nutritional information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, 
protein and salt.  
- BNIC asks for the removal of the Alcohol by volume from the declaration. Firstly, the alcohol by 
volume percentage is already presented on the front label, in the same field of vision as the 
Commercial name and the Legal name of the product. Repeating the alcohol by volume percentage 
will not share any further information with the consumer as this information is already easily 
available on the front label. However, it would take up more room unnecessarily for industry 
members.  
- BNIC would like to inform TTB that the expression of alcohol in fluid ounces may lead to 
confusion among consumers. Fluid ounces are not commonly used in other countries, particularly 
foreign speaking countries. We therefore recommend the option of using international standards 
such as ml or cl. 
- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to not align the declaration on distilled spirits with the FDA 
Nutrition Facts label. The inclusion of such information is unnecessary due to the differences 
between alcohol beverages and other foods, Cognac for example does not contain sodium.  
 
On TTB’s proposal regarding serving sizes:

T : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr 
- BNIC recommends avoiding the use of nutritional information for the whole bottle as this could 
lead to consumer confusion who may believe the information relates to a serving size rather than 
the whole bottle.  
- BNIC would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes. Serving sizes may 
vary between different countries and may also differ depending on the specificity of the product. 
For example, a typical serving size in France for a distilled spirit would be 30ml.  
 
On TTB’s proposal to permit a 20% tolerance above or below the labeled amount for calories, 
carbohydrates, protein and fat: 
BNIC kindly welcomes and supports this proposal. Indeed, BNIC and Cognac industry members have 
calculated average nutritional values for Cognac with an ABV of 40%. TTB’s current proposal would allow 
for this average nutritional value to be used by our industry members and facilitate small and medium-sized 
businesses in implementing the new rule.  
 
On TTB’s proposed exclusion of requesting a new COLA request: 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This 
will largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized 
businesses.  
 
On TTB’s proposed transition period:  
- BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic 
climate for our industry, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for industry members.  
- BNIC would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was 
put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. As a premium product, Cognac stock 
turnover can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits, especially during the 
current particularly difficult economic conjuncture of industry.  
- BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238 : Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  is adopted, that its entry into 
force is aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

As the proprietor of Georgia Winery, | am writing to express my concerns regarding the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and
Notice No. 238, which would mandate the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” statements on wine
labels. While | support initiatives that promote informed consumer choices, | am
apprehensive about the economic and operational challenges this requirement may impose
on Georgia’s wine indugtry, particularly for small and family-owned wineries.

Economic Impact on Georgia’s Wine Industry

Georgia’s wine industry significantly contributes to the state’s economy, supporting local
agriculture, creating jobs, and attracting tourism. The proposed labeling changes would
necessitate comprehensive label redesigns, leading to increased production costs. For
small wineries operating with limited budgets, these additional expenses could be financially
burdensome, potentially resulting in higher product prices for consumers and reduced
competitiveness in the market.

Is more regulation really needed to help support this growing industry or harm it? | ama
believer that allowing free market forces without tight regulation provides the best platform
for successful businesses and communities. Should the government instead focus on the
root cause of allergies or other chronic illnesses instead of regulating small businesses that
are under constant attacks? We, as producers, assume all the risks of the products we
produce and are therefore naturally incentivized to produce a non-harmful products. The
more red tape, hoops to jump through, and restrictions create less growth. Conversely,
shrinking government overreach allows consumers and producers to do business freely
allowing for a mutually beneficial relationship.

Operational Challenges

Implementing the “Alcohol Facts” labeling would require wineries to conduct detailed
analyses of their products to determine accurate nutritional content. This process involves
laboratory testing and compliance verification, demanding both time and financial
resources. Small wineries may find it particularly challenging to absorb these costs without
compromising other critical aspects of their operations.

Alternative Approaches for Consumer Education

While understanding the heaith implications of alcohol consumption is essential, there are
alternative methods to educate consumers without imposing stringent labeling
requirements. Public health campaigns and digital platforms can effectively disseminate
information about responsible drinking and health risks associated with alcohol. These
approaches can reach a broad audience without adversely affecting the economic stability
of local wineries.
A blanket statement regarding the number of alcoholic drinks recommended per person is
flawed as everybody is different. Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it
does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks
consumed.

Conclusion

| urge you to consider the potential economic and operational impacts of the proposed
labeling requirements on Georgia’s wine industry. By exploring alternative strategies for
consumer education, we can achieve the goal of informed decision-making without placing
undue burdens on small businesses that are vital to our state’s economy and cultural
heritage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. | am committed to promoting responsible
consumption and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that educate
consumers while supporting the sustainability of the wine industry.

Sincerely,
Tara Taymore

Comments on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237, RIN 1513-AC93  I appreciate the opportunity to offer my individual comments on the proposed rule regarding Alcohol Facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The intent and purpose of this rule are commendable, as it aims to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the alcohol content and nutritional value of these beverages. Such transparency is crucial for informed consumer choices and aligns with public health objectives. The general outline of the proposed rule is a significant step forward in enhancing label clarity and consumer awareness. However, I would like to offer a few specific comments and suggestions to further improve its implementation, effectiveness and fairness. Linear Display I believe that a linear display of the required information should not only be allowable but actually preferable. It is more cost-effective, efficient, informs consumers sufficiently, and requires less label real estate. Additionally, a linear display is less disruptive to the label's overall design, and avoids impairing the seller’s branding and presentation. Compliance Timeline I propose extending the compliance timeline to six years. Considering the industry standard of a five-year label turnover, a six-year period would better align with this cycle, significantly reducing the regulatory burden. This extension would enable producers to comply without incurring unnecessary costs or causing undue harm to the marketplace and consumers. Given the lengthy development of this rule, an abrupt compliance period shorter than the industry's label turnover timeframe would be impractical and ill-advised.    2 
Categorization of Hard Ciders The rule would benefit from including a separate categorization of hard ciders due to their unique characteristics, rather than jamming them into a non-germane category. Hard ciders differ from other alcoholic beverages in alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. Alcohol Content: Hard ciders vary significantly in alcohol content, from low-alcohol variants to levels comparable to wine or beer. Clear guidelines based on alcohol content would help consumers make informed choices and enable producers to comply with specific requirements. Packaging Sizes: Hard ciders come in various packaging sizes, requiring different labeling considerations. A separate categorization would allow for tailored labeling requirements to accommodate diverse packaging options. Fermentation Variability: The fermentation process for hard ciders differs from that of other alcoholic beverages. Factors like apple type, fermentation duration, and additional ingredients impact the final product. Regulations that account for these variabilities would ensure consumers receive accurate product information. Nutritional Profiles: Hard ciders have distinct nutritional profiles, with varying levels of sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients. A separate categorization would allow for more accurate labeling, ensuring consumers understand the nutritional content. Therefore, I recommend that TTB establish a distinct category for hard ciders within the regulatory framework. One way to do this is by creating specific guidelines that address the unique aspects of hard ciders, including their alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. This approach would improve clarity and compliance, benefiting both consumers and producers. Lessened Requirements for 50 ml Minibottles I recommend lessened requirements for 50 ml minibottles of hard liquor/spirits due to the significant challenges posed by limited labeling space. Prioritizing essential information ensures readability and design integrity. Since minibottles are often sold in sets with comprehensive outer packaging, extensive individual labeling is unnecessary. Their small portion size presents a lower risk, justifying less stringent requirements. Lessened compliance for minibottles benefits consumers by keeping  3 
labels uncluttered and clear, streamlining regulatory processes, and reducing the burden on producers, especially small businesses.  I recommend implementing guidelines for minibottles that specify minimum required information, such as alcohol content and a general warning, to maintain essential disclosures while allowing flexibility. Other Issues § 7.63 Mandatory Label Information ""Mandatory label information"" should be capitalized for consistency with other section titles: ""Mandatory Label Information."" Examples in Figures In the linear display example for distilled spirits (§ 5.212): ""Serving Size 1.7 fl oz (50 mL)"" should read ""Serving Size 1.5 fl oz (44 mL)"" to maintain consistency with other serving sizes. Rounding Rules The rules for rounding percentages and numerical values (such as alcohol content and nutritional information) should be explicitly stated to ensure consistency. For instance, specifying how to handle rounding for values like 14.95% alcohol by volume would provide clarity and avoid discrepancies. I suggest stating: ""All percentages and numerical values should be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percent (0.1%) for clarity and consistency."" Optional Information The conditions for including optional information, such as additional statements of alcohol content or total sugars, should be clearly defined. This clarity would help prevent inconsistent labeling practices and ensure uniform presentation of all necessary information.    4 
Labeling for Small Containers The labeling requirements for very small containers, where space is limited, need clarification. Specifying minimum font sizes and prioritizing information can help producers comply without compromising readability.  I suggest: “For containers smaller than 50 ml, the minimum font size for mandatory information should be 1.0 mm. Priority should be given to listing alcohol content, serving size, and allergens.” Definitions of Terms Terms like ""non-alcoholic,"" ""alcohol free,"" and ""low alcohol"" might be interpreted differently by consumers. Providing clear definitions and consistent usage in the regulations would help prevent ambiguity and ensure consumer understanding. One way to do this would be: ""Non-alcoholic: Contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Alcohol free: Contains 0.0% alcohol by volume. Low alcohol: Contains less than 1.2% alcohol by volume."" Scope of Mandatory Information Clarify what is considered mandatory versus optional information within the Alcohol Facts statement to avoid confusion. Clear distinctions between mandatory and optional information will help ensure consistent labeling practices across the industry. I suggest: ""Mandatory information includes alcohol content, serving size, and nutrient information. Optional information may include additional health claims or ingredient details, provided they are accurately labeled as optional."" Product Variability The rule should address products with variable compositions, such as cocktails with different fruit content that may absorb spirits. Providing guidance on labeling these products will help ensure consumers receive accurate information about their beverages.   5 
A suggested guideline could be: “Products with variable compositions should list average alcohol content and nutrient information based on standard recipes. Any significant variations should be noted in the labeling to inform consumers.” Compliance Date and Small Businesses TTB asked:  Does the proposed compliance date suffice to limit the negative impact on small businesses and reduce overall costs of compliance while ensuring that consumers receive adequate information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the alcohol beverage products they are purchasing and consuming? In my view, the costs of label compliance are substantial, especially for smaller producers. Much of this cost could be avoided by setting the compliance timeframe slightly longer than the average industry label turnover, which is approximately five years. Therefore, I recommend a six-year compliance timeframe. This period would apply to both small and large producers, allowing them to comply earlier on a voluntary basis, while the mandatory requirement would only take effect after six years. This approach would be economically efficient and impose less regulatory burden. Benefits of Alcohol Content Statements TTB asked:  What are the potential benefits to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? I believe that alcohol content expressed as a percentage by volume has been familiar and useful for consumers for years. It provides a clear and straightforward measure that helps consumers make informed decisions. This approach avoids many of the complications associated with alcohol quantity, serving sizes, and package sizes. Therefore, I support requiring alcohol content percentage on all beverages. Alcohol Content Tolerances TTB asked:  Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers? If so, does the same argument apply to wines, which currently have a 1.5 percentage point tolerance for wines up to 14 percent alcohol by volume, and a 1 percentage point tolerance for wines with an alcohol content of over 14 percent alcohol by volume?  6 
In my experience, consumers do not focus on decimal points and fractions. A reasonable tolerance level is acceptable for consumers, as they do not require precise laboratory measurements. Aligning the tolerance for malt beverages with that for wines should be adequate. Broader tolerances accommodate natural product variations and reduce the need for frequent batch testing for alcohol content. Labeling for Non-Alcoholic Malt Beverages TTB asked:  Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume? Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements? It seems evident that non-alcoholic malt beverages absolutely must have a label disclosing that they contain small (or trace) amounts of alcohol. This is important for individuals who avoid alcohol for religious, dietary, medical, or legal reasons. If these beverages are already subject to labeling requirements from other agencies, TTB need not impose further labeling. However, if there is an oversight gap, TTB should ensure proper labeling. Alcohol Content Range for Table Wines TTB asked:  Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers? It seems to me that to reduce the disproportionate burden on small wineries and importers, they should be allowed to indicate alcohol content as a range for table wines. This approach would provide sufficient information to consumers while relieving some of the regulatory burden. Allowing a range would be consistent with the reasons discussed in the NPRM and would not unfairly penalize consumers by depriving them of important information. Dietary Guidelines on Moderate Drinking TTB asked:  Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?  7 
My thoughts are that including dietary advice on moderate drinking has no place on these labels. The purpose of the labels is to disclose the contents of the beverage container to consumers, not to provide general education on drinking habits. Such information does not add to the purchasing decision process and is outside the scope of the rule. While it may be useful in some contexts, it is not appropriate for product labeling.  Thank you for considering my comments. I hope they provide valuable insights and contribute to the successful finalization of the Alcohol Facts labeling regulations.

By providing an easily understandable serving size of &lsquo;standard drink(s)&rsquo; that will match up with public awareness campaigns, we will be able to save lives by preventing excessive alcohol consumption and its harms for both drinkers and non-drinkers alike.<br/>",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,approval,0.5174971222877502,"{'admiration': 0.011850319802761078, 'amusement': 0.0001596400688868016, 'anger': 0.000643160252366215, 'annoyance': 0.004215131048113108, 'approval': 0.5174971222877502, 'caring': 0.015301020815968513, 'confusion': 0.0008895151549950242, 'curiosity': 0.0006061933236196637, 'desire': 0.023953653872013092, 'disappointment': 0.004914791788905859, 'disapproval': 0.00784325785934925, 'disgust': 0.001026769750751555, 'embarrassment': 0.00025915747391991317, 'excitement': 0.0006830365746282041, 'fear': 0.0012436266988515854, 'gratitude': 0.0012134419521316886, 'grief': 0.0004703251470346004, 'joy': 0.0004893224686384201, 'love': 0.0015825001755729318, 'nervousness': 0.0006093838019296527, 'optimism': 0.07904999703168869, 'pride': 0.0011454041814431548, 'realization': 0.019357269629836082, 'relief': 0.0015354895731434226, 'remorse': 0.0006570787518285215, 'sadness': 0.0027557602152228355, 'surprise': 0.00023088256421033293, 'neutral': 0.299816757440567}"
