ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATIONS 
 
G/TBT/N/USA/2182 AND G/TBT/N/USA/2183 
 
(ALCOHOL FACTS STATEMENTS IN THE LABELING OF WINES, DISTILLED SPIRITS, AND MALT 
BEVERAGES) AND (MAJOR FOOD ALLERGEN LABELING FOR WINES, DISTILLED SPIRITS, 
AND MALT BEVERAGES) 
 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States for 
providing the oppor tunity to comment on the draft s “Alcohol Facts Statements in the 
Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spiri ts, and Malt Beverages ” and “Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages”, notified on 22 January 
2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182 and G/TBT/N/USA/2183. The EU apologies for sending 
these comments after the deadline of 15th of August. 
 
The EU would like to note that Codex Alimentarius Guidelines on nutrition labelling 
CXG 2-1985 states with respect to the presentation of nutrient content under Section 
3.4.3 the following: ‘’Information on the amounts of protein, carbohydrate and fat in 
the food should be expressed in g per 100 g or per 100 ml or per package if the 
package contains only a single portion. In addition, this information may be given 
per serving as quantified on the label or per portion provided that the number of 
portions contained in the package is stated.’’  
The EU would like therefore to invite the US authorities to allow the expression of the 
content of  the nutrition declaration to be provided per 100 ml along with the 
information provided per serving size, to align with the provisions of the international 
guidelines above and allow for a more immediate comparison among different  
alcoholic beverages.  If the alignment with the guidelines is not possible, the EU 
would like to invite the US authorities to provide justifications for this deviation. 
 
Finally, the EU would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 
238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is 
adopted, its entry into force be aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.  
 
 
The EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comment s could be taken into 
account and replied to before adoption of the notified drafts.

It should never be provided solely via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology (e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land).  <br/><br/>Because consumers need this information as soon as possible, the final rule should shorten the proposed compliance period from 5 years to 3.5 years to prevent further delay of consumer access to this basic safety information. <br/><br/>Please prioritize transparency and health of those with food allergies by requiring comprehensive labeling of both allergens and ingredients on the physical packaging of alcoholic beverages. This will ensure that Americans who drink have access to all the information they need to make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kristy Mitchell",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,gratitude,0.9860157370567322,"{'admiration': 0.0004327080969233066, 'amusement': 6.0976595705142245e-05, 'anger': 0.00016974408936221153, 'annoyance': 0.0016750498907640576, 'approval': 0.028716595843434334, 'caring': 0.002126215258613229, 'confusion': 0.0005776753532700241, 'curiosity': 0.0002448355662636459, 'desire': 0.0008337426697835326, 'disappointment': 0.0008253998239524662, 'disapproval': 0.0035728977527469397, 'disgust': 0.00020341567869763821, 'embarrassment': 5.5875498219393194e-05, 'excitement': 0.00012364904978312552, 'fear': 0.0001631731283850968, 'gratitude': 0.9860157370567322, 'grief': 4.910328789264895e-05, 'joy': 0.00014117907267063856, 'love': 0.00016033879364840686, 'nervousness': 0.000122151366667822, 'optimism': 0.0019413651898503304, 'pride': 5.851168680237606e-05, 'realization': 0.004426764324307442, 'relief': 0.0002142502780770883, 'remorse': 0.00010062399815069512, 'sadness': 0.0003055641136597842, 'surprise': 4.160559183219448e-05, 'neutral': 0.9528075456619263}"

Japan’s Comment on the “G/TBT/N/USA/2183” 
 
Japan appreciates that the United States of America provided WTO members the 
opportunity to comment on 27 CFR Part 4, 5, and 7  by notifying the 
“G/TBT/N/USA/2183”.  
 
The proposed mandatory labelling of major food allergen could impose significant 
burden on small businesses such as liquor manufacturers and importers. In order to 
reduce the burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to 
prevent any problems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following 
requests: 
 
[Comment] 
Japan requests that the proposal to exempt distilled spirits from mandatory allergen

Comment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) 
VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION 
Dear Administrator Ryan:  
Consumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important 
rulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and 
MajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to 
strengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in 
grams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the 
format and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how 
this rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and 
to urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the 
basic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other 
beverages and food. 
Leading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol 
labeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates 
alcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers 
what’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with 
cheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, 
Calley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full 
transparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 
CFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol 
labeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the 
available evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have 
documented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that

4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but 
significant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  
Similarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard 
drinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate 
their alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that 
do not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more 
conscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of 
alcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related 
harms.7  
These spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to 
consumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for 
Surgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third 
biggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can 
increase the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public 
awareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate 
drinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating 
the health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage 
Labeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that 
worthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its 
pledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  
There is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see 
on the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism 
can end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0001) 
Submitted by: Recover Alaska 
Date: August 7, 2025 
To Whom It May Concern, 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking to require allergen 
labeling for alcoholic beverages. Recover Alaska strongly supports this proposed rule as a 
meaningful step forward in protecting public health and advancing transparency for all 
consumers. 
Recover Alaska is a statewide coalition dedicated to reducing excessive alcohol use and its 
harms across Alaska. In our work, we often hear from Alaskans who are trying to make 
safer and healthier choices for themselves and their families—including individuals with 
food allergies and parents of children with severe reactions. Yet today, they are left 
guessing whether an alcoholic beverage contains a potentially dangerous allergen. 
This is unacceptable. Alcoholic beverages are one of the only consumables not currently 
required to disclose major allergens. And yet many contain common allergens such as 
wheat, milk, eggs, or tree nuts—sometimes used directly, and other times as hidden 
processing aids. 
We applaud TTB for advancing this proposal and recommend the following improvements 
to ensure it truly protects consumers: 
1. Require On-Package Disclosure 
Allergen information must appear clearly and directly on the package, not via QR 
codes or online-only disclosures. Alaska has large swaths of rural and Tribal land 
where digital access is limited or unavailable—this rule must ensure equity by 
making vital safety information universally accessible. 
2. Do Not Exempt Processing Aids 
Allergic reactions can occur even if the allergenic ingredient was used as a 
processing aid. We support TTB’s approach to include allergens regardless of how 
they are used in production. 
3. Strengthen Disclosure Formatting and Speciﬁcity 
TTB should require allergen labeling to follow consistent formatting and placement  
rules, and to include species-speciﬁc language for ﬁnﬁsh. For example, “Contains: 
salmon” is far more helpful than “Contains: ﬁsh. ” 
4. Shorten the Compliance Timeline to 3.5 Years 
As with the Alcohol Facts rule, consumers have already waited too long for basic 
safety information. We urge TTB to shorten the proposed 5-year compliance period 
to 3.5 years. 
Alaskans with food allergies—particularly in remote areas with limited healthcare access—
deserve the same protections as everyone else. This rule is a long-overdue and essential 
move toward that goal. Thank you for your leadership in protecting consumers and 
ensuring that alcohol labeling ﬁnally meets the same public health standards applied to 
other foods and beverages. 
Sincerely,

TTB Proposal on Allergen Declaration in Alcoholic Beverage Labeling 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published the 
proposal (Notice No. 238) ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food allergens in 
alcoholic beverages. 
Comparison of the TTB proposal vs. the Official Mexican Standard NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, 
Alcoholic Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and Commercial Labeling: 
Pursuant to  Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages. 
Pursuant to NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, Alcoholic 
Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and 
Commercial Labeling. 
Proposal to add the following legend to 
alcoholic beverage labeling: 
“Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"" 
followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is 
derived, for example, 
9. Labeling 
 
The labeling of the products covered by this 
Standard, in addition to complying with the 
provisions of the Regulations and other applicable 
legal provisions, shall be subject to the following: 
(…) 
“Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"" 
This wording differs from the current voluntary 
allergen declaration (interim rule,  T.D. TTB -53 
(71 FR 42260) which states that in alcoholic 
beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, 
primary allergens may be voluntarily declared 
on labels affix ed to the container. The 
declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of 
the food source of each allergen (e.g., 
""Contains: egg""). 
9.3 Mandatory Requirements. The following are 
mandatory sanitary and commercial information 
requirements: 
(…) 
9.3.7 Sanitary Information. 
 
9.3.7.7 List of ingredients. 
9.3.7.1.1 The list of ingredients must appear on the 
label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or 
creams and all these alcoholic beverages, which 
after distillation and/or before bottling use 
optional ingredient s and/or additives that cause 
hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy and are 
present in the final product. 
Definition of Major Food Allergen: 
 
""The proposed regulations define the term 
""major food allergen"" as any of the following: 
 
 Milk 
 Egg 
 Fish (e.g.,  bass, flounder, or cod) 
Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, 
or shrimp) 
 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or 
walnuts) 
 Wheat 
 Peanuts 
 Soybeans 
 Sesame 
 
The defined term also includes any food 
ingredient that contains protein derived from 
one of these nine foods or food groups, subject 
to certain exceptions. 
The following foods and ingredients have been 
shown to cause hypersensitivity and must always 
be declared: 
 
9.3.7.1.1.1 Cereals containing gluten, e.g.: wheat, 
rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybr idized strains, 
and products thereof; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.2 Egg and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.3 Peanut and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.4 Soy and its products, with the 
exception of soybean oil; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.5 Milk and dairy products, including 
lactose; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.6 Tree nuts and their derivatives, and 
 
9.3.7.1.1.7 Sulfite in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or 
more. 
Compliance Period: The TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date a final rule 
resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that food allergens must be declared in the 
ingredient list only if they are present in the final product, without the need for a specific warning, 
and only in liqueurs or creams, cocktails, and prepared beverages. 
On the other hand, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the example 
""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". Furthermore, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim rule, T.D. TTB-53 
(71 FR 42260)) establishes that in alcoholic beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, p rimary 
allergens may be voluntarily declared on labels.  The declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the food source of each allergen (e.g., ""Contains: 
egg""). However, the TTB proposal seeks to make allergen declaration mandatory. It should be noted 
that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in distilled alcoholic beverages, 
provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes a distillation process that completely 
removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled product or ingredient. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including 
the following: 
 “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived; or 
 A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that adding 
an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real benefit to the 
consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which would go against 
Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks 
to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers. The CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the 
General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), recommends that allergen 
declaration be preferably done within the ingredient list.  In cases where a separate declaration is 
required, it should be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the 
allergen and, when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.  The 
interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily 
declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include the word ""Contains"", 
followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as ""Contains: egg"". It is proposed 
that the TTB consider the possibility of declaring major allergens as part of the ingredient list, which 
is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients that 
cause hypersensitivity and are present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for 
the consumer to understand and would be in line with the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developme nt (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and that 
excessive information can confuse the consumer. If it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic beverage labeling, it 
is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to provide additional information.  
This can be achieved through electronic labeling, using a QR code, a digital medium, or a website. 
This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited space for consumer information, presenting it 
in a friendly and easy-to-understand format. In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in 
regulatory provisions, and facilitates information reaching young people, a vulnerable g roup, to 
prevent harmful alcohol consumption.  It also allows for the development of educational and 
interactive content for the consumer.  Thus, consumers would be effectively informed without 
overloading alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement 
on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To clearly 
and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed that it be sufficient to include them in 
the product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name.  It is 
also proposed to consider the use of e lectronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to 
display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of  ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of 
the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient list, 
including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section.  It is also suggested to 
evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display detailed 
allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C 
Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) be required to be listed in one 
statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement 
that includes the major food allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the 
major food allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another statement be 
used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, as they 
can easily identify them on the label.  Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic labeling (QR 
codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding  overloading the 
physical product label. 
 5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including the 
proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this information? 
Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on industry members 
as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately? 
Requiring specific wording and location for allergen information on the label can create trade 
barriers and increase costs, negatively affecting the trade of alcoholic beverages.  Therefore, it is 
proposed that this information can be placed anywhere on the label.  According to studies by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), presenting too much information 
together can make it difficult for consumers to identify important data. To avoid this, it is suggested 
to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display 
additional allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements for major 
allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already applicable to all mandatory 
information on alcohol beverage l abels? For example, should the required allergen disclosure 
statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent practicable, should TTB mandate formatting 
consistent with FDA requirements for major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for allergen 
declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional costs for 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs could be considered 
a tec hnical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade 
barriers. This agreement establishes that technical regulations should  not be implemented that 
hinder international trade without valid justification in the legitimate objectives of member states. 
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985): 
Provisions for Allergen Labeli ng of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established that the 
presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. Should a separate 
declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains ________"" (or an equivalent term) 
and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient list, when present.  This provision avoids 
the use of a more extensive legend, which could confuse the consumer. 
Conclusion: 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic beverages 
be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs and barriers to 
international trade.  Likewise, it is proposed that the declaration of major allergens in alcoholic 
beverages be limited to thei r inclusion in the ingredient list.  Should an additional declaration be 
required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the CODEX Alimentarius and the 
Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)), using only the legend 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a more extensive text. It is essential that 
the possibility of using electronic labeling (through QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to 
provide additional information or legends about ma jor allergens be considered.  This method 
facilitates access to relevant information for the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary 
regulatory and commercial burdens.

Executive Summary 
 
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) received an unpaid Application from the 
Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand (BWSCNZ) in 2003 seeking to amend the 
Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements and 
Declarations, of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code). BWSCNZ 
ceased operations in December 2006, and the Application was taken over by the Brewers 
Association of New Zealand (BANZ). In referring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment 
Report refers to BWSCNZ for activities prior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  
 
The Applicant sought an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass (a processing 
aid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain tropical and subtropical fish) on 
the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. The 
exemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a fining 
agent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse reactions 
in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant provided evidence that dietary 
exposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption was extremely low. Results of oral 
challenge studies were also provided indicating that isinglass did not cause an allergic 
reaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher than the 
potential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer and wine. 
A new Good Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in 
isinglass has also been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. 
 
At Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public 
health and safety implications of this Application. At Draft Assessment, two options were 
proposed; (1) reject the Application thus maintaining the status quo; or (2) prepare a draft 
variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the requirement to 
declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a 
clarifying agent.  
 
Risk Assessment 
 
At Final Assessment, the key risk assessment findings include: 
 
• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically 
relevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  
 
• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  
   
• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration 
or centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, 
do not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  
  
• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not 
detectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed 
in the filtration process; and 
  iii
• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very 
low and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers.  
 
Therefore, taking into account all of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers.  
 
The key risk assessment issues, including issues raised by submitters, are discussed in 
Section 8 of this Report. Additional information is provided at Attachment 3 – Risk 
Assessment Report and Attachment 4 – Food Technology Report. 
 
Risk Management 
 
At Draft Assessment, submitters raised concerns regarding the maintenance of the quality of 
isinglass and its usage. FSANZ considers current production methods and market factors 
adequately address the quality of isinglass; and the usage and amount of isinglass in food 
products is managed through existing provisions in the Code for the use of processing aids. 
Information from the wine and beer industries also emphasises that isinglass is sparingly used 
as it is one of the most expensive fining agents available.  
 
Some submitters raised further concerns regarding the impact of an exemption on the 
provision of information for informed choices. FSANZ notes, however, the particular issues 
raised were not in respect of allergenicity or related matters and, therefore, fall beyond the 
scope of this Application.  
 
Due to the above factors, FSANZ does not consider further regulatory measures are required. 
Further detail is provided at Section 9 of this report. 
 
Decision 
 
FSANZ approves a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant an 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
 
Reasons for Decision 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and 
wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: 
 
• does not raise any health and safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers;  
 
• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the 
information related to the allergenicity of the product. 
 
• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products; 
 
  iv
• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen 
declaration; and 
 
• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, 
provides a net benefit to affected parties. 
 
The approved draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. 
 
Consultation 
 
In response to the release of the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ received twenty-seven 
submissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from industry, two from 
government and one from a public health organisation. A summary of submissions on the 
Draft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. 
 
Overall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to 
providing an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption. Of the 
remaining two submitters, one provided support, in-principle, indicating concern that the 
evidence did not show that there is no risk. The other indicated support based on a condition 
that FSANZ consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced 
levels of parvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration.  
 
A significant proportion of submitters who objected to the proposed exemption linked their 
arguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information 
relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. 
The requirement to declare isinglass was seen to enable consumers to make informed choices 
about foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons with a particular 
focus on vegetarianism/veganism.  
 
There were two submitters who objected to an exemption as they believed they had 
experienced an allergic fish-related reaction from consuming wine. Further information was 
sourced from these submitters in relation to their allergic condition and the products that may 
have caused allergic reactions.   
 
After considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ clarified some of 
the issues raised by submitters through targeted consultations.  
  
Implementation and Review 
 
The FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food 
Regulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). 
 
Subject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to 
grant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In 2003, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) received an unpaid Application 
from the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand (BWSCNZ) seeking to amend the 
Code to provide an exemption from the allergen labelling requirements for isinglass when 
used in the production of beer and wine. BWSCNZ ceased operations in December 2006, and 
the Application was taken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand (BANZ). In 
referring to ‘the Applicant’ this Final Assessment Report refers to BWSCNZ for activities 
prior to December 2006 and BANZ thereafter.  
 
This Final Assessment Report discusses matters in relation to providing an exemption from 
the allergen labelling requirements for isinglass and addresses issues raised in submissions to 
the Draft Assessment Report. The draft variation to the Code is provided at Attachment 1. 
 
1. Nature of the Application 
 
1.1 Background to the Application 
 
On 12 August 2002, the BWSCNZ, on behalf of the Brewing Industry of New Zealand, wrote 
to FSANZ requesting that an exemption be granted for isinglass from the mandatory 
declaration requirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory 
Statements and Declarations. In the accompanying documentation that was provided to 
FSANZ, the BWSCNZ requested a permanent exemption, or if this was not possible, a 
temporary exemption, to allow further scientific evidence to be obtained regarding the non-
allergenicity of isinglass.   
 
On 20 September 2002, FSANZ responded to this request, advising that, in the absence of 
substantial scientific evidence on the relationship between residual levels of isinglass in beer 
and associated allergenicity, it was not in a position to consider exemptions to the 
requirements in clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. However, FSANZ advised that it would consider 
an application to amend the Standard should further research provide persuasive new 
evidence in this area. 
 
On 6 January 2003, the BWSCNZ resubmitted the document dated 12 August 2002 and 
requested that it be considered as an application. It was formally accepted and placed on the 
FSANZ Work Plan on 7 February 2003.  
 
On 15 October 2003, the Applicant requested that wine also be considered within the scope 
of their Application. Additionally, the Applicant requested a four-year exemption from the 
requirement to label for isinglass, in line with the European Commission’s proposed 
amendment to Directive 2000/13/EC. Under this amendment, the European Commission 
proposed to consider temporary exemptions from allergen labelling until November 2007, for 
derivatives of allergens that are unlikely to cause allergic reactions, while awaiting further 
scientific evidence for a permanent exemption.   
 
On 19 December 2003, FSANZ agreed to expand the scope of the Application to include 
wine. However, FSANZ did not agree to the request for a temporary exemption and sought 
further information from the Applicant under subsection 34(1) of the Food Standards 
Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (FSANZ Act) (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). A 
response to this request was received on 28 June 2004.   
 4
However, further information provided by the Applicant was considered to be insufficient 
and a subsequent request for information under subsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was 
in force prior to 1 July 2007) was sent in December 2004.  
 
Meanwhile in October 2004, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that 
was submitted to the European Commission by the Brewers of Europe, and the Brewing, 
Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BE/BFBi) under the requirements of 
Commission Directive 2003/89/EC. This dossier titled ‘Notification for the temporary 
exemption from labelling for isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing’ (the BE/BFBi 
notification), was used by FSANZ in the assessment of this Application.   
 
On 16 May 2005, FSANZ received further information from the Applicant and proceeded to 
the Initial Assessment of Application A490. The Initial Assessment Report for Application 
A490 was advertised for public comment from 5 October to 16 November 2005. Following 
an assessment of submitters’ comments, together with the information provided by the 
Applicant, FSANZ concluded that sufficient information was not available to progress the 
Application to the Draft Assessment stage. 
 
In March 2006, FSANZ requested the Applicant to provide further information under 
subsection 34(1) of the FSANZ Act (as was in force prior to 1 July 2007). In February 2008, 
FSANZ received further information from the Applicant, and proceeded to the Draft 
Assessment.  
 
The Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director, 
Allergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Loblay endorsed the FSANZ 
preferred regulatory approach. The Draft Assessment Report was advertised for public 
comment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. Following an assessment of the comments 
received from submitters and the completion of targeted consultations with submitters on 
specific issues raised by them, FSANZ proceeded to the Final Assessment.  
 
1.2 Basis of the Application 
 
The Applicant is seeking to amend the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of 
Standard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared when present in food as 
an ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food additive or component of a 
food additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing aid.   
 
Specifically, the Applicant is seeking an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
Isinglass is a permitted processing aid commonly derived from dried swim bladders of certain 
tropical and subtropical fish. A statement such as ‘Produced with isinglass (fish product)’ is 
used to declare isinglass on the label. The exemption was initially sought on the basis that 
isinglass has a long history of use as a fining agent in the production of beer and wine and has 
not been known to cause adverse reactions in fish-allergic individuals.  
 
1.3 Scope of the Application 
 
This Application is specific to the use of isinglass in the production of beer and wine only.  
  
 5
Isinglass, for the purpose of this Application, is defined as a piscine collagen derived 
exclusively from the dried swim bladder of tropical and subtropical fish species for use as a 
fining/clarifying agent in beer and wine. Collagen derived from other parts of fish has not 
been considered in this Application.  
 
1.4 Additional information provided by th e Applicant since Initial Assessment 
 
During Initial Assessment in 2005, FSANZ was aware of a number of scientific studies in 
progress in Europe, USA and Australia aimed at addressing outstanding questions on the 
allergenic potential of isinglass. Results of these studies were made available to FSANZ as 
detailed below.  
 
In February 2008, the Applicant provided FSANZ with a copy of the dossier that was 
submitted to the European Commission in October 2006 jointly by the BE and the BFBi, in 
support of a request for an extension of the exclusion from Annex IIIa of Commission 
Directive 2005/26/EC beyond 25 November 2007, and thus, from the requirement to label 
isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing. This dossier contained analytical studies and 
clinical trials on isinglass coordinated by FARRP (Food Allergy Research and Resource 
Program), University of Nebraska, USA. Further investigations related to residues of 
isinglass in beer were carried out by Brewing Research International. 
 
In April 2008, the Australian Wine Research Institute and Wine Federation of Australia 
provided relevant scientific information in relation to the use of isinglass in wine. In addition, 
FSANZ requested specific information in relation to the supply and usage of isinglass by 
Australian and New Zealand beer and wine manufacturers.   
 
These documents answered the outstanding questions on the allergenic potential of isinglass 
and enabled the completion of the Draft Assessment of this Application. 
 
2. The Issue 
 
Currently, clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 requires that fish and fish products must be declared 
when present in food as an ingredient, an ingredient of a compound ingredient, a food 
additive or component of a food additive, or a processing aid or component of a processing 
aid. This declaration enables fish-allergic consumers to be aware of the presence of any 
potential allergenicity in the food and provides for informed choices in the context of health 
and safety.   
 
The exemption was initially sought on the basis that isinglass has a long history of use as a 
fining agent in the production of beer and wine and has not been known to cause adverse 
reactions in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, the Applicant has provided evidence that 
dietary exposure to isinglass through beer and wine consumption is extremely low. Results of 
oral challenge studies have also been provided indicating that isinglass does not cause an 
allergic reaction to fish sensitised individuals when consumed at levels substantially higher 
than the potential exposure levels that may be encountered through the consumption of beer 
and wine. Parvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. A new 
Good Manufacturing Code of Practice to minimise the allergen parvalbumin in isinglass has 
also been established by the isinglass manufacturing industry. 
  
 6
The issue is whether granting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the 
label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, can have an 
impact on the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers. That is, is consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer or wine likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers and therefore, is the fish-related declaration meaningful to those consumers? 
 
3. Objectives 
 
The specific objectives for the assessment of this Application are to: 
 
• consider the granting of an exemption from the mandatory requirement to declare 
isinglass on the label of beer and wine; 
 
• ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergic to 
fish; and 
 
• ensure adequate label information is provided to fish-allergic consumers. 
 
In developing or varying a food standard, FSANZ is required by its legislation to meet three 
primary objectives which are set out in section 18 of the FSANZ Act.  These are: 
 
• the protection of public health and safety; 
 
• the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make 
informed choices; and 
 
• the prevention of misleading or deceptive conduct. 
 
In developing and varying standards, FSANZ must also have regard to: 
 
• the need for standards to be based on risk analysis using the best available scientific 
evidence; 
 
• the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards; 
 
• the desirability of an efficient and internationally competitive food industry; 
 
• the promotion of fair trading in food; and 
 
• any written policy guidelines formulated by the Ministerial Council. 
 
4. Historical Background 
 
The current mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 were developed during the 
review of the Code, as part of Proposal P161 – Review of Specific Labelling Statements, and 
was gazetted in December 2000. The list of substances included in the Table to clause 4 of 
Standard 1.2.3 is based on the recommendations of an Expert Panel commissioned by the 
then Australia New Zealand Food Authority.   
 7
These substances are: cereals containing gluten and their products, namely, wheat, rye, 
barley, oats and spelt and their hybridised strains; crustacea and their products; egg and egg 
products; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; tree nuts and sesame seeds and their 
products; peanuts and soybeans and their products; and added sulphites in concentrations of 
10 mg/kg or more.   
  
To qualify for mandatory declaration, the substance(s) needed to be recognised by medical 
experts as a frequent cause of severe systemic reactions resulting in significant morbidity or 
mortality. 
 
The justification for the mandatory declaration requirements in Standard 1.2.3 was based on 
the requirement to protect the health and safety of those individuals who are susceptible to 
adverse reactions from certain foods or substances in foods.     
 
Among the substances included in the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3, the Code grants 
exemption from mandatory labelling declaration for beer and spirits made using cereals 
containing gluten.   
 
5. Current Regulations 
 
5.1 Current domestic regulations 
 
5.1.1 Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code 
 
The Standards relevant to this Application are 2.7.2 – Beer, 2.7.4 – Wine and Wine Product, 
1.3.3 – Processing Aids and Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements 
and Declarations. 
 
Alcoholic beverages meet the definition for food in the FSANZ Act and are therefore 
required to comply with the General Food Standards set out in Part 1 of the Code. In addition, 
beer and wine are further regulated by Part 2.7 – Alcoholic Beverages and are defined in 
Standards 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 respectively.  
 
The Table to clause 6 in Standard 1.3.3 permits isinglass to be used as a processing aid in 
food. This Standard defines a processing aid as a permitted substance used in the processing 
of raw materials, foods or ingredients, at the lowest level necessary irrespective of any 
maximum permitted level specified, to fulfil a technological purpose relating to treatment or 
processing, but does not perform a technological function in the final food. The Table to 
clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in 
regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The 
relevant GMP criteria are: 
 
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect;  
 
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and  
 8
(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
The Standard most relevant to this Application is Standard 1.2.3. Clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 
requires that the presence of fish or fish products in a food must be declared on a label (or 
declared in connection with the display of the food or provided to the purchaser on request 
when a food is not required to bear a label). This requirement is irrespective of the fish or fish 
product being used as an ingredient; a compound ingredient; a food additive; or a processing 
aid.  
 
5.1.2 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
Suggestions were raised by some submitters to the Draft Assessment Report with respect to 
dealing with exemptions for allergens more generically, rather than on the basis of individual 
applications. These are addressed below. 
  
• Possible exemptions from the allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3 should be dealt 
with in a systematic and broader fashion and not through individual applications. 
 
Applications to FSANZ seeking to change the Code are made by individuals, organisations or 
companies. FSANZ is required to respond to and assess each application received. Applying 
general criteria to all possible exemptions from allergen declarations may not be practical due 
to the diversity of products and their applications. The risk assessment process may require 
case specific scientific information, as is the case in this Application. 
 
• Standard 1.2.3 should be reviewed so that there is no requirement to declare products of 
allergens where it can be demonstrated that they do not contain the allergenic protein. 
 
FSANZ considers the above issue to be beyond the scope of this Application. At the request 
of the Ministerial Council, FSANZ has commenced a review of the regulatory management 
of food allergens. The overall aim of the review is to determine whether regulatory and non-
regulatory measures are meeting the needs of allergic consumers in a manner that is practical 
for industry to implement, and that is effective in achieving the objectives of food regulatory 
measures outlined in the FSANZ Act. A number of issues relevant to the regulatory 
management of food allergens are being considered including a framework to identify non-
allergenic ingredients derived from allergenic foods. 
 
5.2 Overseas and international regulations 
 
5.2.1 Codex Alimentarius 
 
The Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods [Codex Stan 1-1985] 
requires the mandatory declaration of substances that are known to cause adverse reactions. 
The list of substances that are required to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’, in 
addition to other major food allergens. The use of isinglass as a processing aid is subject to 
ingredient declaration in accordance with Sections 4.2.1.4 and 4.2.4 of the General Standard 
for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods.  
 
The Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods has been in place for 
many years and no revision relevant to the exemption considered here has taken place as yet.   
 9
FSANZ’s consideration of the labelling exemption for isinglass used in the clarifying process 
of wine and beer is based on the more recent scientific information available and is in line 
with other international regulations. 
 
5.2.2 United States of America 
 
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Food Allergen Labelling 
and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) applies to most domestic and imported 
food and beverage products. However, it is the responsibility of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax 
and Trade Bureau (TTB) to issue regulations with respect to the labelling of wine, distilled 
spirits and malt beverages. In July 2006, the TTB proposed mandatory labelling of major 
food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages. The proposition of mandatory 
allergen labelling parallels amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
contained in the FALCPA.  
 
These proposed regulations were published as an interim rule which allows producers, 
bottlers and importers of alcoholic beverages to voluntarily declare the presence of major 
allergens (including fish and proteins derived from fish). The interim regulations set forth 
mandatory requirements for how such labelling must be applied should an industry member 
choose to do so. The purpose of introducing interim regulations was to allow adequate time 
for consultation on the proposed final regulations whilst encouraging the alcohol beverage 
industry to introduce allergen labelling.  
 
The proposed regulations and interim rule establishes a petition process through which a food 
ingredient may be exempted from the labelling requirements if the ingredient does not cause 
an allergic response that poses a risk to human health or if the ingredient does not contain 
allergenic protein. FSANZ is aware that the TTB is currently considering petitions for the 
exemption of isinglass. 
 
5.2.3 Canada 
 
In February 2004, Health Canada proposed amending the Food and Drug Regulations to 
enhance allergen labelling requirements on pre-packaged foods for specific allergens. This 
proposal included the requirement for mandatory labelling of fish by species name. In 
September 2004, Health Canada amended its original proposal such that fining agents derived 
from fish, milk and egg, used during the manufacture of standardised alcoholic beverages, 
would be exempt from the allergen labelling requirements.   
 
Health Canada recently published its proposed regulatory amendments for allergen labelling 
(including the exemption from labelling for isinglass and other fining agents) in Canada 
Gazette, Part I in July 2008. The final regulations are expected to be published in the Canada 
Gazette, Part II, in early 2009. The exemption was based on a history of use of such fining 
agents and the lack of documented clinical evidence of allergic reactions caused by 
consumption of these products. Health Canada has expressed that it may reconsider its 
position on a labelling exemption for fining agents used in the production of standardised 
alcoholic beverages, should scientific evidence become available suggesting that residues of 
these substances remaining in the final beverage could cause a health risk to susceptible 
individuals.     
  
 10
5.2.4 European Union Member Countries 
 
The European Commission’s Directive 2000/13/EC provides for the possibility of an 
exclusion from the allergen labelling requirement for substances derived from allergenic 
ingredients, for which it has been scientifically established that such substances are unlikely 
to cause an adverse reaction in susceptible individuals. As a result, Commission Directive 
2005/26/EC granted a temporary allergen labelling exemption for specific derivatives of 
allergenic ingredients or substances until 25 November 2007. This provisional list of 
exemptions included ‘fish gelatine or isinglass used as a fining agent in beer, cider and wine’. 
  
During the period of this temporary labelling exemption, industry sectors wishing to make an 
application for a permanent labelling exemption were responsible for submitting research to 
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA received and considered applications for 
a permanent labelling exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in beer and wine 
production.  
 
EFSA considered the information on isinglass used in wine and concluded that ‘the data 
submitted do not allow the Panel to assess the likelihood that isinglass used as fining agent 
will trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals under conditions of use stated by 
the applicant’.  
 
EFSA also considered, separately, information on isinglass used in beer and concluded that 
‘it is not very likely that isinglass used as a clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe 
allergic reaction in susceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use 
specified by the applicant’.  
 
The Commission considered EFSA’s opinions and concluded that a permanent exemption 
from allergen labelling should apply to isinglass used in the production of both beer and 
wine. Annex IIIa of Commission Directive 2000/13/EC was amended by Commission 
Directive 2007/68/EC as of 27 November 2007. This amendment stipulates a revised 
regulatory approach to allergen labelling and includes the requirement that fish and products 
thereof must be declared on a label except fish gelatine and isinglass used as a fining agent in 
beer and wine.  
 
5.2.5 Japan 
 
Japan’s current allergen labelling requirements became enforceable in April 2002 and divides 
allergen labelling into two categories, mandatory and recommended, according to the number 
of cases and degree of seriousness of allergic reactions.  
 
Fish is not included on the list of allergens requiring mandatory labelling (these are eggs, 
milk, wheat, buckwheat and peanuts) and only specific species of fish (salmon and mackerel) 
are recommended for allergen labelling. 
 
Furthermore, alcohol beverages and related products are not subject to the allergen labelling 
requirements. Hence labelling of isinglass and other fining agents used in the production of 
alcoholic beverages is not required in Japan.   
  
 11
5.3 Regulatory differences and its impact 
 
As stated above, labelling exemption for isinglass has already been granted in many 
countries, including all of the European Union member countries. Currently, beverage 
manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand supplying the market in these countries would 
have to meet different isinglass declaration requirements for local and export markets. This 
regulatory difference to labelling may have an impact on trade and increase the costs to 
manufacturers.  
 
6 Matters of Relevance 
 
Details of technical information and analytical data related to this Application are provided in 
the Risk Assessment Report in Attachment 3 and the Food Technology Report in Attachment 
4. This section provides some key information related to isinglass. This information has been 
extracted from the documents provided by the Applicant, the Australian Wine Research 
Institute, and the Wine Federation of Australia.  
 
6.1 Parvalbumin 
 
Parvalbumin is identified as the food allergen associated with isinglass. Parvalbumins have 
molecular weights of approximately 10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values
1. Parvalbumins are water 
soluble and resistant to heat treatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975 [as 
cited in Chen et al. 2006]).  
 
6.2 Definition of isinglass 
 
6.2.1 Isinglass definition used by th e Applicant (submission 16 May 2005) 
 
Isinglass is a pure form of collagen, which is derived from the dried swim bladders of certain 
tropical and subtropical fish. In brewing, only isinglass from catfish, croakers and threadfins 
is used.  
 
6.2.2 Isinglass definition from  the BE/BFBi notification 
 
Isinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen. Within the BE/BFBi notification, the term is 
used exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim bladders and does not 
include collagen from fish skins. This notification states that the isinglass used in brewing is a 
pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of a restricted range of specific 
tropical and subtropical fish species. These species are specific catfish, croakers and 
threadfins.  
 
6.3 Components of isinglass 
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denaturation product, gelatin. 
Isinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. 
Collagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass. Only 
residual amounts of the fish protein parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass.  
 
                                                
 
1 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     
 12
6.3.1 Collagen 
 
Collagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish 
muscle, skin and swim bladder. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by 
cross linkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular 
weight of 800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, 
which are usually small, compact proteins with molecular weights ranging between 10 kDa 
and 80 kDa. 
 
Collagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to 
form random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass 
production because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from 
coldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC.   
 
6.4  Commercial production of isinglass 
 
The swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish are used to produce isinglass on a 
commercial scale for use in the alcohol beverage industry. The swim bladder is an air sac, 
located in the dorsal part of the body cavity quite separate from the fish muscle tissue. The 
adherence between the bladder and the body cavity is minimal and as such, it can be readily 
detached without significant contamination with the fish muscle tissue.  
 
6.4.1 Traditional processing method 
 
The traditional basic production process has been reported to vary between manufacturers, 
which can also depend on the source and species of the fish. However, a number of steps are 
considered standard practice. Dried swim bladders are blended according to specific quality 
and other criteria, followed by granulation, washing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen 
peroxide and rinsing. A temperature of less than 15ºC is maintained throughout the wet steps.  
The product is then sold as powder, paste or liquid. The paste and liquid forms include a 
source of sulphur dioxide as a preservative.  
 
As a result of the traditional processing method the final parvalbumin levels in isinglass have 
shown to be reduced by about a half compared to the starting material. 
 
6.4.2 New manufacturing protocol (Good Manufacturing Code of Practice) 
 
The three major European isinglass manufacturers (AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and 
Murphy & Son Ltd) have developed a Good Manufacturing Code of Practice for the sourcing 
and manufacturing of isinglass. This new protocol, which minimises the parvalbumin content 
in isinglass, includes the following additional steps.  
 
• The fish species with high parvalbumin level in the swim bladder have been excluded. 
 
• A granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed      
25 mm has been introduced. This step increases the surface area thus ensuring adequate 
sterilising during peroxide wash and improving the extent of washing out of the 
parvalbumin in the subsequent buffer wash. 
  
 13
• Additional washing steps using phosphate buffer and further water washing have been 
introduced. Phosphate buffer wash has shown to have the greatest effect in reducing 
parvalbumin levels in samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin levels.  
 
All of the isinglass produced by the major European manufacturers supplying to the 
Australian and New Zealand markets is now produced in accordance with the Good 
Manufacturing Code of Practice (new protocol) designed to minimise the levels of 
parvalbumin. 
 
6.4.3 Products used by the Applicant 
 
Based on the information received from the beer and the wine industry, isinglass 
commercially available for their use in Australia and New Zealand is manufactured by the 
European manufacturers AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son Ltd.  
 
FSANZ has also been made aware of the existence of other European companies who are not 
manufacturers of isinglass but resellers or blenders of fining agents who source the raw 
material from the above mentioned manufacturers. In Australia and New Zealand, isinglass is 
predominantly sourced through a local supply network from the European manufacturers, 
blenders and resellers.  
 
6.5 Isinglass as a processing  aid/clarifying agent  
 
6.5.1 History of usage  
 
At Initial Assessment, the Applicant stated that isinglass has been used in the clarification of 
beer and wine for over a hundred years. The dossier submitted by BE/BFBi in 2004 made a 
similar statement and, based on a rigorous literature search, concluded that no isinglass-
related allergy cases have been reported. A further literature search was completed by 
BE/BFBi to identify any reports which might have been published since 2004. No reports of 
allergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish sensitised individuals have been found. 
 
A literature search has also shown no reports of any adverse reactions to wine ingestion that 
is attributable to the consumption of isinglass. 
 
6.5.2 Usage levels in beer and wine 
 
The rod-like structural integrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for 
efficient clarification (Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the 
fining activity is based upon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically 
attract yeast cells with negatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged 
polyphenolic and protein components. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the 
bottom of the container.  In the sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in a 
firm sediment that is resistant to disturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  
 
The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 in the Code specifies the use of Good Manufacturing 
Practice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the food 
(i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  
  
 14
In the brewing process, isinglass is typically added after fermentation and cooling of the beer.  
The typical usage level is 15 mg/L for brewery conditioned beer and 35-60 mg/L for cask-
conditioned beer. Isinglass is subsequently removed by sedimentation followed by filtration 
or centrifugation. Cask-conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or centrifugation and 
relies on gravity settling.  
 
In the wine production process, isinglass is added prior to fermentation to remove phenolic 
compounds from white juice or immediately post fermentation to remove yeast, phenolic and 
tannin compounds from white wine. The typical usage level is 10-25 mg/L for white wines. It 
is assumed that isinglass is seldom used in red and rosé wines. Isinglass is removed by 
sedimentation and filtration. The information provided by the Australian Wine Research 
Institute states that a laboratory trial is undertaken on individual batches of wine prior to the 
addition of isinglass to accurately determine the amount of isinglass to be added so as not to 
result in an over-fined wine. 
 
6.5.3 Residues of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
Isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration or 
centrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.   
 
6.6 Toxicological assessment 
 
Isinglass is a natural product derived from the swim bladders of tropical and subtropical fish. 
FSANZ is not aware of any toxicity concerns related to the use of isinglass as a clarifying 
agent. The BE/BFBi notification reports that in addition to being a source of isinglass, the 
fish swim bladders (also known as fish maws) are consumed as food in many parts of the 
world. More than 2750 metric tons are accounted for by such consumption.  
  
7. Key Risk Assessment Questions 
 
What is the evidence in relation to the allergenicity of isinglass?  
 
What is the level of isinglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an adverse 
reaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the final product? 
 
What is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then being 
carried into the final product? 
 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
 
8. Risk Assessment Issues 
 
This section assesses the allergenicity of isinglass and addresses risk assessment issues raised 
by submitters in response to the Draft Assessment Report. The full details of the risk 
assessment are presented in Attachment 3. 
  
 15
8.1 Allergenicity of isinglass 
 
8.1.1 What is the evidence in relation to  the allergenicity of isinglass?  
 
• The three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not of 
clinical importance in IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin, the allergenic fish 
protein of clinical significance, is only present in trace amounts in commercial 
isinglass. 
 
• A number of searches of the published literature failed to identify any reports of 
adverse reaction to wine or beer that can be attributed specifically to isinglass. 
 
• Oral challenge studies have indicated that isinglass manufactured according to either 
the traditional or the new protocol, do not provoke allergic reactions. Two separate oral 
challenge tests have been conducted using twenty-one fish-allergic patients in total. 
None of the patients had positive reactions to the oral challenge tests.  
 
These findings support the conclusion that isinglass is unlikely to pose a risk to fish-allergic 
consumers. 
 
8.2 Presence of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
8.2.1  What is the level of isi nglass residue present in beer and wine? Is there a risk of an 
adverse reaction occurring in susceptible individuals from residual isinglass in the 
final product? 
 
• The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 specifies the use of Good Manufacturing 
Practice in regulating the maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the 
food (i.e. beer and wine in this instance).  
 
• Isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, 
filtration or centrifugation resulting in very low residual levels in the final product.  
 
• Residual amounts of isinglass in bottled and canned beer are below the limit of 
detection, and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/ L. Isinglass residues are 3 mg/L 
for keg beer and 5 mg/L for cask beer.  
 
• The results for wine indicate no residual isinglass has been detected in a small sample 
of commercially available wines fined with isinglass (detection limit 1 mg/L) and made 
following GMP. Therefore, it has been concluded that the concentration of isinglass is 
likely to be less than 1 mg/L. Results of subsequent analysis of isinglass-fined wines 
have supported this conclusion. 
 
• The dose of isinglass, regardless of whether isinglass was manufactured according to 
either the old or new protocol, tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral 
challenge studies, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of 
beer or wine that could be consumed by an individual within a single sitting. 
  
 16
• Parvalbumin would only constitute a minute fraction of isinglass residue in beer or 
wine. This is supported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples 
fined using isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol.  
 
8.3 Potential of parvalbumin partit ioning out into the bulk liquid  
 
8.3.1 What is the potential of parvalbumin partitioning out into the bulk liquid and then 
being carried into the final product? 
 
The information provided by the Applicant indicates the following.   
 
• Due to the inherent entrapment property of collagen, it can be expected that the 
parvalbumin residues present in isinglass would remain entrapped to a certain degree. 
 
• Parvalbumin is insoluble in the acidic conditions of beer and wine. Analytical testing of 
the sediments indicates that parvalbumin indeed precipitates with the isinglass and is 
removed prior to packaging the final product.  
 
8.4 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
The following issues were raised in relation to the risk assessment for this Application. 
 
• There is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass does not raise any safety concerns for 
fish-allergic consumers. 
 
The Applicant provided information on three clinical studies that have been conducted, in 
Australia and in Europe, to evaluate the effect of isinglass and isinglass-fined wine on fish-
allergic consumers. The three clinical studies, which involved thirty-one fish-allergic patients 
in total, were conducted according to robust protocols. No allergic reactions related to 
isinglass were reported under the conditions of the oral challenges described in any of the 
studies. Taking into account all the other information provided by the Applicant, these results 
support the conclusions that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any 
safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.   
 
Additionally, since 2005 an explicit exemption has been granted from declaration in beer and 
wine by the European Commission. FSANZ is not aware of any health risks or concerns in 
the European Union member countries as a result of this exemption. 
 
• The literature review was based on only one search engine and used only two search 
terms.   
 
The Applicant has provided the outcomes of a total of three literature searches. Information 
on two of the literature searches have been presented in the Initial Assessment Report and the 
Draft Assessment Report. Information on all three searches is now presented in the Final 
Assessment Report. All three searches have failed to identify any publications that may be 
relevant to isinglass allergy. 
 
• There are uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod 
parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived 
isinglass.   
 17
Parvalbumin is a fish protein that appears to be highly conserved among a wide range of fish 
species including cod and tropical fish species.  
 
Analyses comparing available sequences from a range of fish species have demonstrated 
close sequence similarity across many fish species as a general rule, and there is no reason to 
suggest this would not be the case for fish species used in isinglass production. The well 
purified and characterised cod parvalbumin was used to generate polyclonal antibodies to 
parvalbumin, to provide broader specificity, allowing detection of parvalbumin from various 
fish species. Western blot data provided by the Applicant indicates that the cod-parvalbumin 
polyclonal antibodies detected parvalbumin from tropical fish species. The polyclonal 
antibodies were utilised in the cod-based ELISA. In addition, the Applicant also provided 
data where a monoclonal carp-based ELISA was used to detect parvalbumin in various test 
samples. The two methods vary slightly in their sensitivity and specificity, but together they 
provided mutually supporting information on the level of parvalbumin in isinglass.  
 
• The test numbers used in the clinical studies are small and therefore, have limited 
statistical power. 
 
The clinical studies provide information on a total of thirty-one fish-allergic patients, and 
undoubtedly a larger number would have been desirable. However, the fact that the number 
of fish-allergic patients that could be recruited is relatively small, may reflect the prevalence 
of fish allergy in the community. The targeted nature of the recruitment of fish-allergic 
individuals and the strict qualifying criteria applied in the selection of participants, limits the 
number of subjects available to participate in clinical studies. No statistical analysis was 
undertaken due to the small number, however, the studies were conducted according to robust 
protocols and no allergic reactions were reported under the conditions described in the report. 
In this case, the high quality of the clinical testing data obtained using a panel of consumers 
clinically diagnosed to be fish allergic minimises concerns over quantity. These studies, 
which provide an important piece of scientific evidence, were not considered in isolation. 
Together with other evidence, the clinical studies support the conclusions that consumption 
of isinglass-fined beer and wine does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic 
consumers.   
 
• One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed 
potatoes. This trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually 
consumed. In addition, alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food 
allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. 
 
Fifteen fish-allergic individuals, aged between 21-66 years, participated in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled food challenge according to an internationally accepted protocol. The oral 
challenge material was prepared using four doses (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) of 
isinglass in 40 g mashed potato. The use of mashed potato as a matrix made it possible to use 
such relatively high doses of isinglass. This could not be achieved if the oral challenge was 
conducted using isinglass-fined beer or wine based on the extremely low level of isinglass 
(generally below 1 mg/L) in such beverages.  
 
In relation to the role of alcohol in lowering the dose that may trigger an allergic reaction, it 
would have to significantly lower the dose for it to be relevant to the level of isinglass that 
could possibly be present in fined beer and wine (generally below 1 mg/L).   
 18
Also, the study report indicates that all individuals have reported regularly consuming beer or 
wine, at least some of which would have been fined with isinglass, without incident. 
 
This study should be considered in the context of two additional oral challenge studies 
provided by the Applicant. These are briefly outlined: 
 
A second study was conducted on a younger group of fish-allergic individuals, aged between 
6-22 years with isinglass in mashed potato. No allergic reactions were reported in any of the 
six individuals tested up to a dose of 20 mg isinglass.   
 
The third study included ten fish-allergic subjects and each consumed 100 mL of isinglass-
fined or control wine over 10-15 minutes. No subjects developed an allergic reaction 
requiring medical treatment and no abnormalities were noted during follow-up reports. 
 
Collectively, information from all the oral challenge studies presented by the Applicant, 
including those where mashed potato was used as a matrix, support the conclusion of the risk 
assessment.   
 
• The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-
allergenicity. Whilst most known allergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a 
necessary condition for allergenicity. Therefore, this method is unsuitable for assessing 
the allergenicity of isinglass. 
 
Pepsin digestion information was submitted by the Applicant. However, the information was 
not considered in the risk assessment and had no bearing on the risk assessment conclusion. 
Reference to pepsin digestion has been deleted in the Final Assessment Report. 
 
• The data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand 
populations and the threshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are 
unknown. 
 
FSANZ acknowledges the general lack of information on the prevalence of various food 
allergies in Australia and New Zealand. There is currently no consensus on a threshold dose 
for fish allergens. Such information would be a valuable resource and would certainly add to 
the strength of the evidence base for the assessment of isinglass. However, even in the 
absence of such information it is possible to reach a scientific conclusion based on all the 
other information that is available. For example, a published report of a clinical study 
conducted in Australia provides such information. The study, discussed in more detail in the 
Risk Assessment Report, presents outcomes of an oral challenge of ten adult fish-allergic 
individuals with isinglass-fined and un-fined wine. No allergic reactions were reported during 
two hours post challenge and over the following six days.  
 
• There is a possibility of significant under-reporting of allergic reactions due to: 
 
- a lack of awareness among wine drinkers and health professionals of the possible 
presence of fish proteins in wine 
- the tendency to blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse 
reactions occurred 
- the lack of reporting of food allergic reactions to an authority or a medical 
practitioner, especially in adult sufferers  
 19
- the absence of a requirement in New Zealand for food allergic reactions to be 
reported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the 
reaction in a public journal. 
 
Clinical studies discussed above indicate that fish-allergic individuals do not react to isinglass 
or isinglass-fined wine. Also, the extremely low level of isinglass and the even lower level of 
parvalbumin that may be present in isinglass-fined beer and wine argues against these 
suggestions. 
 
• The evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under 
the new code of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in 
the Draft Assessment Report.  
 
The Draft Assessment Report presents analytical data on bottled beer and wine which 
indicates that the level of residual isinglass, if it can be detected at all, is around 1 mg/L. This 
residual level would be expected regardless of whether the isinglass was prepared according 
to the old or new protocol. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-allergic consumers, 
would only constitute a minute fraction of the isinglass residue in beer or wine. This is 
supported by the fact that parvalbumin was not detectable in beer samples fined using 
isinglass prepared according to the old or the new protocol. On this basis, information can be 
extrapolated and will be clarified as such in the Final Assessment Report.  
 
• The allergenic fish proteins are normally found in the flesh of the fish, but in some rare 
cases, also collagen can cause allergies. Isinglass contains this particular collagen 
which is found in fish so theoretically it can cause, in select individuals, an 
anaphylactic reaction. 
 
There is no credible evidence to support the clinical relevance of this statement. Collagen is 
not considered by allergy clinicians to be a significant fish allergen and FSANZ is not aware 
of any reports of anaphylactic reactions to fish collagen. The medical literature reports that 
IgE to fish collagen has been detected in only a few Japanese individuals. However, the 
clinical relevance of these findings has not been confirmed by oral challenges. In addition, 
the oral challenge studies presented in the Risk Assessment Report do not support the 
suggestion that collagen is relevant in fish allergy. In two of these studies, twenty-one fish-
allergic individuals of various ages, were challenged with up to 50 mg fish isinglass (collagen 
from the fish swim bladder) within a period of two hours. No allergic reactions were reported 
in any of these individuals.  
 
• The assessment that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely
 to 
present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, does not indicate that 
there is no risk. 
 
Food regulation does not aim to achieve, and can not deliver, zero risk. FSANZ risk analysis 
indicates the consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of 
allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers and therefore it does not require a regulatory 
measure.  
 
• Two submitters objected to providing an exemption as they have experienced allergic 
reactions to wine containing fish products and/or seaweed. 
  
 20
Further information was sought from these submitters. One indicated a seaweed specific 
allergy and no allergy to fish or shellfish. Isinglass is derived from the swim bladders of fish 
and is not a derivative of seaweed. 
 
Additionally, the labelling exemption is specific to isinglass alone, for use as a clarifying 
agent in the production of beer and wine. Isinglass and seaweed are unrelated and therefore, 
the issue raised by the submitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  
 
The other submitter indicated an allergy to fish and shellfish which had been diagnosed by a 
medical practitioner specialising in allergies. This submitter also indicated the use of a skin 
prick test as part of the diagnosis. This submitter was unable to provide the details of the wine 
that caused the allergic reaction except for the information that the product contained a 
statement ‘may contain fish products’. In this case it cannot be categorically concluded that 
the reaction to wine ingestion experienced by this submitter is attributable to isinglass 
without further information and testing.  
 
The scientific evidence shows that isinglass does not raise any health and safety concerns for 
fish-allergic consumers. In addition, as stated previously since 2005 an explicit exemption 
has been granted from declaration in beer and wine by the European Commission. FSANZ is 
not aware of any health risks or concerns in the European Union member countries as a result 
of this exemption. FSANZ is unable to conclude that the allergic reactions mentioned above 
are related to the use of isinglass in the fining process of the wine.   
 
• One submitter indicated that a family member had experienced a severe reaction to fish 
containing a ciguatoxin and continues to experience reactions in circumstances such as, 
when coming into contact with objects such as hand rails which people who have 
handled fish have touched. 
 
Fish contaminated with ciguatoxin causes food borne illness in humans, which is unrelated to 
fish allergy. The Primary Production and Processing Standard for Seafood (Standard 4.2.1) 
regulates the safety of all seafood in Australia, including toxin contamination. In New 
Zealand these requirements are covered by the New Zealand Fishing Industry Agreed 
Implementation Standards. Application A490 deals specifically with the exemption of 
isinglass from the labelling requirements of mandatory allergen declarations in Standard 
1.2.3.  Isinglass and ciguatoxin are completely unrelated and therefore, the issue raised by the 
submitter is not relevant in the context of this Application.  
 
8.5 Summary of risk assessment  
 
In summary, the key risk assessment findings include: 
 
• the three main components of isinglass (collagen, elastin and gelatin) are not clinically 
relevant in IgE-mediated allergy to fish;  
 
• parvalbumin, the allergenic fish protein, is present at very low levels in isinglass;  
   
• isinglass added to beer and wine for clarification is removed by sedimentation, filtration 
or centrifugation, resulting in residual levels of isinglass which, when detectable at all, 
do not exceed 1 mg/L of bottled beer or wine;  
   
 21
• parvalbumin, although present in trace amounts in commercial isinglass, is not 
detectable in the clarified final product as it co-sediments with isinglass and is removed 
in the filtration process; and 
 
• exposure to isinglass through the consumption of clarified beer and wine would be very 
low and, based on oral challenge studies, would not be expected to provoke reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers.  
 
On the basis of the above, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and 
wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.  
 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
9. Risk Management Measures 
 
At Draft Assessment submitters raised their concerns regarding the maintenance of the 
quality of isinglass and its usage, and impact on the provision of information for informed 
choices. These matters are addressed below.  
 
9.1 Maintaining the quality of isinglass  
 
Isinglass is a highly valued clarifying agent and is specifically sought by wine and beer 
manufacturers for its superior functionality compared to other clarifying agents. There are a 
number of market factors that underpin maintenance of high quality isinglass including:  
 
• Isinglass commercially available for use by the beer and wine industry in Australia and 
New Zealand is manufactured by AB Vickers, Kerry Bioscience and Murphy & Son 
Ltd. These are the three major manufacturers supplying the world market. 
 
• These three manufacturers have come together in developing a Good Manufacturing 
Code of Practice, for the manufacture of isinglass low in parvalbumin (new 
manufacturing protocol).  
 
• All of the isinglass produced by these manufacturers is now produced in accordance 
with the new manufacturing protocol. 
 
• The commercially available isinglass referred to above has an established market 
advantage and is widely used by the beverage manufacturers who seek a superior 
functionality. Any quality issues will undermine its status and use in the market place. 
As such, there would be no obvious advantage or incentive for isinglass manufacturers 
to compromise the quality of isinglass.  
 
9.2 Usage of isinglass 
 
The usage of isinglass is regulated in the Code. The Table to clause 6 of Standard 1.3.3 – 
Processing Aids, specifies the use of Good Manufacturing Practice in regulating the 
maximum amount of isinglass which may be present in the final food. The relevant Good 
Manufacturing Practice criteria for isinglass include: 
  
 22
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limite d to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect; 
  
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of food as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and 
(c) the material is prepared and handled  in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
Additionally, information from the industry indicates that isinglass is sparingly used as it is 
one of the most expensive fining agents available. 
  
9.3 Issues raised in submissions to the Draft Assessment Report 
 
This section addresses risk management issues raised by submitters in response to the Draft 
Assessment Report.  
 
9.3.1  Issues related to the quality and use of isinglass
 
 
• How will the isinglass manufacturing standard be monitored? 
 
• Isinglass could be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards. 
 
There are a number of market factors that support the maintenance high quality of isinglass as 
outlined in Section 9.1.  
 
Due to these factors FSANZ considers market imperatives will serve to maintain the 
provision of high quality product and it is unlikely that isinglass in commercial quantities 
would be sourced from countries with less stringent manufacturing standards.  This process 
will inherently be self monitored by industry and its use of product.   
 
• Impose a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing 
protocol, is sourced and used. 
 
Only trace amounts of parvalbumin have been detected in isinglass (from 1µg/g for the new 
protocol to 10 µg/g for the traditional method). For consumers, exposure to isinglass in the 
fined beverage (bottled beer and wine) is unlikely to be more than 1 mg/L regardless of 
which protocol was used to prepare the isinglass. This aspect is already regulated in the Code 
(Standard 1.3.3) for the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent. Accordingly, consumer 
exposure to parvalbumin would be in nanogram levels regardless of whether the isinglass 
manufacturing protocol is old or new. In addition, the oral challenge studies discussed in this 
report indicate that isinglass prepared according to the old or new protocol (up to 20 mg and 
50 mg, respectively) did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the fish-allergic participants. 
 
Therefore, imposing a condition that only isinglass manufactured using the new 
manufacturing protocol is sourced and used is unjustifiable. Including provisions for 
manufacturing to the new protocol would be unenforceable.  
  
 23
9.3.2 An alternative approach to declaring isinglass 
 
• If beer and wine industry’s concern is the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not 
permit the use of the term ‘isinglass’? 
 
This Application deals specifically with the labelling requirements for mandatory allergen 
declarations. The available scientific evidence shows that isinglass is not likely to cause an 
allergic reaction to fish-allergic consumers. Therefore, FSANZ considers the current 
requirement for the mandatory declaration of isinglass on product labels of beer and wine is 
not warranted regardless of how it may be worded.  
 
9.3.3 Review procedures 
 
• Regular reviews should be undertaken and if reactions do start to occur, amendments to 
the Code should be made. 
 
FSANZ can prepare a proposal to amend the Code based on emerging evidence, as 
appropriate. This would apply to any new evidence relevant to the allergenicity of isinglass 
when used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. 
 
9.3.4 Provision of information beyond allergenicity 
 
• Labelling is required for vegetarians and vegans, and for people with other ethical, 
religious, environmental or personal reasons to make informed choices. 
 
• Removing the labelling requirement would breach current Australian and international 
law regarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans.  
 
• Allowing an exemption for labelling would be misleading and deceptive as it does not 
provide adequate information for consumers to make informed choices for example 
vegetarian/vegan consumers. 
 
• Manufacturers should be required to disclose every ingredient used in the production 
process for all foods. 
 
The purpose of this Application is to seek an exemption from the labelling requirements of 
mandatory allergen declarations in Standard 1.2.3. The purpose of allergen declarations is to 
protect the health and safety of those individuals susceptible to adverse reactions from certain 
foods or substances in foods. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of isinglass-fined 
beer and wine, is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers. 
Therefore providing an exemption would enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity 
information, to enable fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. Maintaining the 
status quo on the basis of the consequential use of allergen labelling by vegetarian and vegan 
consumers to make informed choices goes beyond the scope of this Application.  
 
In Australia and New Zealand food manufacturers have the option of providing the food 
suitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans on the label on a voluntary basis and 
may do so as a customer service and to meet the consumer needs. Where manufacturers 
choose to make a voluntary claim of this type, the general provisions in food law and fair 
trading law as they relate to misleading or deceptive conduct, apply.   
 24
Furthermore, if the food suitability information specific to vegetarians or vegans is not 
provided on the label of packaged foods, the supplier can be contacted to obtain this 
information. Standard 1.2.2 of the Code requires the name and address of the supplier to be 
listed on the label, and many suppliers provide a free call telephone number on their labels. 
Additionally, information from several sources such as websites and advocacy groups are 
also available to assist vegetarian and vegan consumers.     
 
A requirement to label packaged foods to enable vegetarians to make informed choices is the 
subject of a separate Application (A545 – Vegetarian labelling), currently being considered 
by FSANZ. 
 
There is no requirement in the Code to declare non-allergenic processing aids in the label. 
Specifically, clause 3 of Standard 1.2.4 does not require the declaration of a substance (other 
than those mentioned in Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3) used as a processing aid in 
accordance with Standard 1.3.3. As such, other animal-derived clarifying agents are not 
required to be labelled. This approach is consistent with ingredient labelling requirements 
internationally. 
 
10. Options 
 
At Final Assessment two options are presented for addressing this Application: 
 
10.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application 
 
Reject the Application, thus maintaining the status quo – this would not allow the exemption 
from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present in beer and wine as a 
result of its use as a clarifying agent.  
 
10.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  
 
Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of the Standard 1.2.3 for exemption from the 
requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its 
use as a clarifying agent. 
  
11. Impact Analysis 
 
11.1 Affected parties 
 
The parties likely to be affected by this Application and preferred approach include: 
 
• Consumers of beer and wine who are allergic to fish; 
 
• Industry – Australian and New Zealand manufacturers and importers of beer and wine 
and isinglass manufacturers and distributors supplying to the Australian and New 
Zealand markets ; and  
 
• Government, including the enforcement agencies of Australia States/Territories and 
New Zealand. 
  
 25
11.2 Benefit Cost Analysis 
 
The Benefit Cost Analysis assesses the immediate and potential impacts of each regulatory 
option on the affected parties. 
 
11.2.1 Option 1 – Reject the Application 
 
Under this Option, the status quo would be maintained and the Code would not be amended 
to allow the exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent.  
 
11.2.1.1 Benefits and Costs 
 
 
It is unlikely that maintaining the status quo will greatly impact the identified parties.  As 
beer and wine will continue to be produced and consumed in the current environment, there 
will be no additional benefits or costs to consumers, industry and government. 
 
11.2.2 Option 2 – Prepare a draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3  
 
11.2.2.1 Benefits
 
 
Industry  
 
Granting an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, provides the following potential 
benefits: 
 
• provides industry with an additional choice of clarifying agent that does not require an 
allergen declaration, therefore, providing greater technical flexibility without creating 
negative consumer perceptions. FSANZ has been made aware that although isinglass is 
considered a superior clarifying agent, the brewing industry does not currently use 
isinglass due to the mandatory declaration requirement.  
 
• industry will be able to use isinglass without incurring allergen labelling costs. 
 
• beer and wine manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand currently supplying the 
local as well as labelling exempted export markets will not be required to provide 
separate labelling. Similarly wine and beer imported from the labelling exempted 
countries would not require additional labelling.  This reduces costs and enables 
manufacturers to compete more effectively in the global environment.  
 
Consumers 
 
• Removing the requirement to declare isinglass should minimise the confusion between 
perceived and actual risk and contribute positively to a more accurate assessment of 
products among fish-allergic consumers.  
 
• Generally, fish-allergic consumers will benefit in terms of increased choice of beer and 
wine products.  
  
 26
Government 
 
• Enforcement agencies would no longer be required to enforce the mandatory allergen 
declaration for isinglass.  
 
• Since this amendment is not likely to present a health and safety risk to fish-allergic 
consumers the health care expenditure of government will not be impacted.  
 
• There may be further enhancement in consumer confidence in the regulatory system as 
a consequence of the improved accuracy in product allergenicity information due to the 
proposed changes. Enforcement agencies may benefit from this increase in consumer 
confidence.  
 
11.2.2.2 Costs
 
 
Industry  
 
• As the use of isinglass in beer and wine would be a voluntary choice and does not incur 
additional labelling, no additional costs would be imposed on industry. 
 
• Submissions from industry did not identify any added costs.  
 
Consumers 
 
• Consumers will continue to have a broad choice in terms of quality and price points 
across the range of beer and wine in the market place.  
 
• Consumers are not expected to incur additional costs.  
 
Government 
 
• There are no expected costs to government as a result of this amendment to the Code.  
 
11.3 Comparison of options 
 
Options 1 and 2 would continue to protect the health and safety of fish-allergic consumers of 
beer and wine clarified using isinglass. Scientific evidence shows that consumption of 
isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers.  
Option 2 will provide fish-allergic consumers with an increased choice of beer and wine 
products, and enhance the accuracy of product allergenicity information, to enable fish-
allergic consumers to make an informed choice. This option will also provide the industry 
with greater technical flexibility and ease the presence of international trade obstacles due to 
different labelling requirements. 
 
Overall, a comparison of the options at Final Assessment suggests Option 2 provides greater 
net benefit to the affected parties.

COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY 
 
12. Consultation 
 
12.1 Public consultation 
 
12.1.1 Initial Assessment 
 
The Initial Assessment Report for Application A490 was advertised for public comment from 
5 October to 16 November 2005. In response, FSANZ received twenty submissions, with 
eleven submissions from industry, six from government, and three from consumers. 
 
Overall, eleven of the submitters provided support for the exemption, six objected to 
providing an exemption and one did not provide a preferred option. Of the remaining two 
submitters, one indicated cautious support awaiting results of the safety assessment. The 
other indicated support based on a condition that only isinglass derived from the swim 
bladders of (tropical and subtropical) fish should be exempt.  
 
12.1.2 Draft Assessment 
 
At Draft Assessment, FSANZ undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public 
health and safety implications of this Application. The Draft Assessment Report was 
advertised for public comment from 1 October to 12 November 2008. In response, FSANZ 
received twenty-seven submissions, with sixteen submissions from consumers, eight from 
industry, two from government and one from a public health organisation. 
 
Overall, seventeen of the submitters (sixteen consumers and one government) objected to 
providing an exemption, and eight (industry) provided support for the exemption.  Of the 
remaining two submitters, one indicated support, in principle, for granting exemptions from 
mandatory labelling of ingredients derived from allergenic sources.  However, with regard to 
isinglass this submitter expressed concern that the evidence did not indicate that there is no 
risk.  This submitter was also concerned as to how the manufacturing standard that minimises 
the level of parvalbumin in isinglass will be monitored, and the possible supply of isinglass in 
the marketplace from a manufacturer with less stringent manufacturing standards. 
 
The other indicated support based on a condition that FSANZ consider making it a 
requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of parvalbumin be exempt 
from allergen declaration for isinglass.  
 
A significant proportion of submitters that objected to providing an exemption linked their 
arguments to FSANZ’s second order objective (the provision of adequate information 
relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices) as a reason for their decision. 
The requirement to declare isinglass was considered as enabling consumers to make informed 
choices about foods for ethical, religious, environmental, and other personal reasons. In 
addition, the majority of submitters from this group indicated that they were either a 
vegetarian or vegan or support the provision of information on this basis.  
 
There were two submitters who objected to providing an exemption since they believe they 
had experienced an allergic reaction from consuming wine.

A summary of submissions to the Draft Assessment Report is at Attachment 2. 
 
12.2 Targeted consultation 
 
The Draft Assessment Report was reviewed by an allergy expert, Dr Rob Loblay, Director of 
the Allergy Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Dr Rob Loblay endorsed the 
FSANZ preferred regulatory approach.  
 
Following an assessment of the comments received to the Draft Assessment Report, targeted 
consultations with submitters on specific issues were conducted. These targeted consultations 
included contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an allergic reaction 
in response to consuming wine.  
 
12.3 World Trade Organization 
 
As members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Australia and New Zealand are 
obligated to notify WTO member nations, where proposed mandatory regulatory measures 
are inconsistent with any existing or imminent international standards and the proposed 
measure may have a significant effect on trade. 
 
The proposed permission has already been granted in some international markets and 
products with similar allergen labelling exemptions are marketed internationally. FSANZ 
considers providing an exemption will further reduce variations between countries and 
facilitate international trade. This position is supported by domestic and international 
submitters from the industry. 
 
Therefore at Draft Assessment, FSANZ considered it was not necessary to notify WTO 
member nations of the proposed amendment under either the Technical Barriers to Trade or 
the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreements. 
 
13. Communication Strategy 
 
Submissions indicated support from industry for the proposed labelling exemption. However 
a significant proportion of other submitters objected to the proposed exemption. The 
objection was based on the provision of information with a particular focus on 
vegetarianism/veganism which is beyond the scope of this Application.  
 
After considering the submissions to the Draft Assessment Report, FSANZ completed 
targeted consultations to clarify some of the issues raised by submitters. These targeted 
consultations included contacting submitters who indicated that they have experienced an 
allergic reaction in response to consuming wine.  
 
Issues raised by submitters have been considered and addressed as part of the Final 
Assessment. Should this standard be amended, FSANZ will work closely with Anaphylaxis 
Australia and Allergy New Zealand on messages to inform their members that this measure is 
safe and supported by themselves and allergy specialists. A fact sheet will be placed on the 
FSANZ website.

CONCLUSION 
 
14. Conclusion and Decision 
 
Decision 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in 
beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent. 
 
FSANZ approves the draft variation to the Table to clause 4 of Standard 1.2.3 to grant 
exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer and 
wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent as it: 
 
• does not raise any safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers  
 
• removes an unnecessary declaration on the product label and thereby enhances the 
information related to the allergenicity of the product. 
 
• provides fish-allergic consumers with increased choice of beer and wine products 
 
• supports industry with an added choice of clarifying agent that does not require allergen 
declaration 
 
• the impact analysis concludes that exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass 
on the label, when present in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, 
provides a net benefit to affected parties. 
 
The draft variation to the Code is at Attachment 1. 
 
15. Implementation and Review 
 
The FSANZ Board’s decision will be notified to the Australia and New Zealand Food 
Regulation Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council). 
 
Subject to any request for review by the Ministerial Council, the approved draft variation to 
grant exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label, when present in beer 
and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent, will come into effect upon gazettal.

APPLICATION A490 – EXEMPTION OF ALLERGEN DECLARATION FOR ISINGLASS 
Summary of Submissions on the Draft Assessment Report  
 
Submitter  Sector Comments 
AB Vickers Industry • Supports the Application. 
• The robust and comprehensive risk assessment conducted by FSANZ has taken into consideration the best 
scientific evidence that is now available concerning the allergenic potential of isinglass. 
• Until quite recently, a lack of scientific evidence had made it difficult to substantiate any claims regarding the 
likely risk to fish-allergic consumers consuming beverages in which isinglass had been used. Previously, the 
strongest argument in favour on non-labelling was that isinglass had a long history of safe use without a single 
recorded incident of allergic reaction. 
• The scientific studies in the Draft Assessment Report have now confirmed that any residual levels of isinglass 
that may be present are extremely low, if present at all. 
• Clinical trials have further demonstrated that isinglass does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive 
individuals at far higher exposure rates than would be encountered in beers and wines. 
• The isinglass exemption will allow fish sensitive consumers to make informed choices concerning beverage 
consumption and will allow consumers a wider choice of beverages though the removal of a precautionary-
based label approach. 
• The brewing and winemaking industries will also benefit from this exemption through increased flexibility of 
choice in processing (clarifying) aids and isinglass producers will benefit through the increased opportunity to 
trade with Australian and New Zealand beer and wine producers. 
• The Draft Assessment Report acknowledges the regulatory approach to allergen labelling of isinglass in 
several countries where labelling exemption has already been granted. An exemption for isinglass in Australia 
and New Zealand will contribute to increased confidence in allergen labelling statements for those consumers 
who travel globally. 
• A consistency in allergen labelling declarations will benefit beverage manufacturers through simplification of 
labelling strategies and will also benefit isinglass manufacturers who will be able to trade freely with beverage 
companies.

Australian Food and 
Grocery Council 
(AFGC) 
Industry • Supports the Application. 
• Where there is little clinical evidence of allergic reaction and there is a low risk that the substances are 
capable of inducing an allergic response at the concentrations present in the final product, then the product 
should be exempt from mandatory allergen labelling requirements. 
• The AFGC supports the requirement for allergen labelling and the need to inform consumers, and supports the 
FSANZ assessment that isinglass-fined beer and wine, are not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in 
fish-allergic consumers. 
• However, the AFGC notes the work being undertaken by FSANZ to review the entire standard, and that the 
principles and assumptions on which the standard is based need to be reassessed, in line with this 
recommendation.  Such an assessment would provide a comprehensive reassessment of exemptions to 
allergen labelling, rather than dealing with exemptions in a piece-meal approach. 
Brewers Association of 
Australia & New 
Zealand 
Industry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: 
• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to 
consumers. 
• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the 
beer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. 
• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. 
• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material 
which is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. 
• Where isinglass is not used because of such labelling requirements, the increased unnecessary costs to the 
consumer and the environment resulting from increased filter powder usage. 
• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label. 
• The new and standardised process for isinglass production. 
• In this case, the requirement to label for the presence of isinglass results in misleading information being 
provided to the consumer.

Food Technology 
Association of Australia 
Industry  • The Technical Sub-Committee agreed with option 2 for the exemption of allergen declaration for isinglass, 
however, after much debate also considered the following: 
- Beer and wine had been again exempt from another labelling requirement required on all other foods, the 
rationale for which is still unclear to other food manufacturers as alcohol is no less a nutrient than any 
other of the specified nutrients and alcoholic beverages are part of the average diet of many consumers. 
- Is this application the beginning of similar requests for allergen exempt labelling from other 
manufacturers? 
- It is understood that egg white (albumen) is also used as a clarifying/fining agent in some sectors of the 
wine industry and the labelling of this possible allergen has not yet been discussed. 
Foster’s Group Industry • Supports the Application for the following reasons: 
• The long and safe use of isinglass in the brewing industry with no evidence that it constitutes a threat to 
consumers. 
• The recognition in the Report of the trace amounts of isinglass, and therefore parvalbumins, remaining in the 
beer, and that threshold doses for allergens would appear to be finite, measurable and detectable. 
• The absence of clinical evidence to show that isinglass is likely to trigger a dangerous reaction. 
• The restricted choice for some consumers in the event that labelling is required for the presence of a material 
which is not likely to cause an allergic reaction. 
• Exemptions granted in the EU and the absence of international consensus on the need to label.

Industry • Fully supports the Application. 
• Any labelling for food allergens must take into account whether or not that food will produce an allergic 
reaction and that labelling for all allergen levels may lead to further restricted diets, increased frustration and 
risk-taking and undermining the integrity of labelling statements. 
• Consumers need to trust that allergen labelling information is reliable and not be subjected to misleading, 
precautionary statements that may be ignored based upon, for example, prior experience consuming the food 
product in question without an adverse reaction. 
• A robust, scientifically based labelling allergen schema, which properly identifies those products containing 
allergenic protein likely to cause adverse reaction, will provide consumers with beneficial, non-misleading 
information.  The exemption of isinglass meets and serves these interests. 
• With a global economy and free travel among consumers, determinations made by respective government 
bodies about allergen labelling should not impede trade without serving a public interest. The applicability of 
an allergen labelling requirement for a particular product should be the same from one country to another.  
Consumers will benefit from meaningful allergen labelling statements they can rely upon to make food 
choices whether they are a resident or visiting a particular country. The exemption of isinglass meets these 
goals.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
New Zealand 
Winegrowers (NZW) 
Industry • Supports the Application, based on the information presented in their submission of 16 November 2005 and 
the additional findings of the Report (submission lists Draft Assessment Report findings). 
History of Non-Allergenicity 
• To date, not aware of any incident of a consumer ever having suffered an allergic reaction due to the use of 
isinglass in wine. Nor has any such incident been relayed to NZW from relevant New Zealand health 
authorities.  The absence of any reported allergic reactions was also noted in the EFSA report. 
Usage in New Zealand 
• The average level of isinglass addition in New Zealand is approximately 0.05-0.25 g/L.  Isinglass is used 
sparingly as it is one of the most expensive fining agents available. Both the Draft Assessment Report and the 
Australian Wine Institute submission note that isinglass is not intended to be in the final product and any 
residue is likely to be negligible due to the filtering and racking processes. 
Benefits to New Zealand Producers if Exemption is Granted 
• New Zealand and Australia are the only major wine producing countries in the world that require an allergen 
declaration if isinglass is used in the production of wine. In addition to the concerns of the potential for the 
requirement to create a trade barrier, it is also relevant to consider the unfairness which arises as a result of 
importer non-compliance. Mandatory label statements on all New Zealand wine are verified by the producer’s 
compliance with the Wine Act 2003.  No such system applies to imported wine, many of which bear no 
allergy statement and due to difficulty detecting isinglass residues in wine, it is very likely that a proportion of 
these will have been made using undeclared isinglass. If the exemption is granted, the negative consumer 
perceptions associated with the declaration of fish products will be removed and compliant producers can 
compete on a level playing field with non-compliant users of isinglass. 
• The exemption of isinglass labelling will also: 
- give wine producers the option to choose the best quality clarification option without losing consumer 
confidence; 
- increase consumer choice for consumers who suffer from fish allergies, and 
- reduce costs by removing the need to produce different labels for different vintages and batches or for 
export markets which do not require the declaration of isinglass. 
• A considerable body of evidence and international research supports the key findings of the Draft Assessment 
Report that isinglass raises no safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers when present in wine and beer.  
 36
Submitter  Sector Comments 
The Allergen Bureau Industry • Supports the Application. 
• Considers that the risk to allergic consumers from the consumption of wine and beer treated with isinglass is 
very low, that advisory allergen labelling for the presence of fish does not constitute an effective risk 
management strategy and that the proposed exemption from labelling is justified. 
• Labelling of allergens represents a risk management strategy intended to inform potentially allergic 
consumers to the presence of a hazard in food and thereby enable them to make appropriate food choices. In 
order for this strategy to be effective, the information provided must be understood by, and relevant to, the 
consumer. Where labelling accurately advises of the presence of an identified allergen, the use of such 
labelling provides useful information to the consumer. However, the use of allergen advisory labelling in 
relation to a food component that does not contain the allergen moiety devalues the benefit of allergen 
labelling. This unnecessarily limits consumer choice and is likely to confuse consumers and can potentially be 
misunderstood or ignored. 
• This recommendation is consistent with the recent conclusion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, 
Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that ‘it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a sever allergic reactions in susceptible individuals’ (reference 
provided). 
• As identified by FSANZ, the major components of isinglass are type 1 collagen, gelatin and small quantities 
of elastin.  The Bureau is not aware of evidence to suggest that these components are clinically relevant to fish 
allergies.   
• The level of parvalbumins in isinglass is reported in the EFSA evaluation and the FSANZ Draft Assessment 
Report to be very low, in the range 1-34 ppm. The introduction of a modified preparation procedure for 
isinglass has the potential to yield concentrations up to 10-fold lower and consistently below 1 ppm. 
• During the development of the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) procedure for 
labelling of the presence of cross-contact allergens in food, the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels 
(LOAEL) for total fish protein of 1-100 mg were identified (reference provided). The lower end of this range 
was used in establishing the first action levels. At this level, subjective responses such as numbness or pruritis 
at the site of contact or general uneasiness may be reported by sensitive individuals, although these cannot be 
verified by observers in clinical studies.  The first VITAL action level separates Action Level 1 at which it is 
considered a precautionary advisory statement is not required and Action Level 2 at which a precautionary 
advisory statement is required. In another comparison of clinical studies, the lowest reported provoking dose 
was identified as 5 mg (reference provided). Based on parvalbumin concentration in fish muscle of 4000 g/g 
or 0.4% (reference provided), a consumer would need to drink unrealistic amounts of beer (80 L of cask beer 
or 200L of packaged beer) to consume an amount of parvalbumin consistent with exposure to 1 mg total 
protein, that at which only mild subjective reactions are observed in clinical trials.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
New Zealand Food 
Safety Authority 
(NZFSA) 
Government • Supports option 2 for the exemption of isinglass subject to the following condition: 
• FSANZ should consider making it a requirement that only isinglass with substantially reduced levels of 
parvalbumin be exempt from allergen declaration for isinglass. This could be achieved, for example, through 
an industry guideline or Code of Practice, requiring wine and beer manufacturers to comply with the ‘new 
code of GMP’ (Good Manufacturing Practice) for the sourcing and use of isinglass as outlined in the Report. 
Reasons for suggesting a condition 
• The Report states that the three major European manufacturers of isinglass have developed a common code of 
GMP for the sourcing and manufacturing of isinglass (‘new code of GMP’) to reduce the parvalbumin content 
in isinglass. The Report also states that the Application claims that nearly 100% of the isinglass used in New 
Zealand and Australia is sourced from these three manufacturers. NZFSA is concerned that ‘nearly all’ is not 
ALL, therefore, some isinglass used in the production of wine and beer in New Zealand and Australia is not 
sourced from the three European manufacturers using the ‘new code of GMP’. There is also no guarantee that 
imported wines use isinglass manufactured to this new Code.  Isinglass not manufactured under the ‘new code 
of GMP’ is considered to contain higher levels of parvalbumin and therefore, puts fish-allergic consumers at a 
higher risk of having an allergic reaction. 
Additional Comments on the Draft Assessment Report 
Correct use of the term GMP 
• Throughout the report the term GMP has been incorrectly referred to as Good Management Practice.  The 
term GMP applies to Good Manufacturing Practice which is a different practice to Good Management 
Practice. 
Risk Assessment 
• Agrees with the conclusion in the FSANZ risk assessment that if industry uses isinglass prepared under the 
industry agreed GMP, then the risk of exposure to fish allergens is expected to be extremely low. 
• Some concerns in relation to the evidence supplied by the applicant on which this risk assessment was based 
and asks that these be addressed in the Final Assessment Report. These same concerns were raised in the 
Opinions of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety 
Authority (the Panel): 
- While there have been few if any documented reports of adverse events that can be attributed to fish 
allergy from consuming wine or beer fined with isinglass, it should be noted that there could be a 
significant underreporting of reactions because it is uncertain whether wine drinkers and health 
professionals have been aware of the possible presence of fish proteins in wine.  
- The literature review was based on one search engine and used only two search terms.  The Panel noted 
certain limitations associated with the restricted search strategy used. This would not support the statement 
in the Report that a comprehensive literature search was undertaken.  
 38
Submitter  Sector Comments 
- The Panel noted that there were ‘uncertainties with regard to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod 
parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass’.  
Therefore, testing for residual isinglass should be treated with caution. 
- The results of the clinical studies need to be treated with caution as the test numbers are small and 
therefore, have limited statistical power. 
- One of the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges used isinglass in mashed potatoes. The Panel 
noted that this trial was performed in a food matrix in which isinglass is not usually consumed. In addition 
it noted that alcohol is considered to lower the dose that may trigger a food allergic reaction in susceptible 
individuals. 
- The high susceptibility of isinglass to pepsin digestion is presented as evidence of non-allergenicity.  The 
Panel noted that this method is ‘unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass’. Whilst most known 
allergens are resistant to pepsin digestion this is not a necessary condition for allergenicity. 
Summary 
• Notes that the Panel took a cautious approach when presenting its opinions on the isinglass exemption, 
particularly where there was insufficient information available on which to base an opinion. Despite this a 
permanent exemption for isinglass used as a fining agent in both beer and wine was granted in 2007. 
• Assume that the evidence provided by the beer industry which used isinglass manufactured under the new 
code of GMP was extrapolated for wine, however, this is not made clear in the Report. Asks that FSANZ 
provide the scientific evidence in the Final Assessment Report that would support this extrapolation. Without 
this evidence believes there is a sound basis to impose the condition with regulatory option 2 as proposed by 
NZFSA.  
• Essential that regular reviews are undertaken and if necessary, amendments are made, especially if reactions 
do start to occur. 
Queensland Health Government • Does not support the Application. 
• Response made by Queensland Health representing whole of Queensland Government. 
• Need to err on the side of caution particularly where in relation to the following key assessment findings: 
- ‘parvalbumin is….possibly the sole allergen for most individuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish’ 
- ‘the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new protocol has been shown to be 
extremely low…’ 
- ‘a significant amount of isinglass introduced in beer and wine is removed allowing only a residual amount 
of isinglass to remain…’ 
- ‘parvalbumin….is unlikely  to be present in the bulk of beer or wine….’ 
  
 39
Submitter  Sector Comments 
- ‘the residual amounts of isinglass that are shown to remain in beer and wine are well below the isinglass 
dosage used in oral challenge tests…’ 
• Notes the Codex general standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods. The list of food allergens that are 
required to be declared includes ‘fish and fish products’. There are no exemptions to these labelling 
requirements. In addition, there are variations in approaches between countries. 
• In addition, ‘the data on the prevalence of fish allergy in the Australian and New Zealand populations and the 
threshold dose of the allergen for fish-allergic individuals are unknown’ (Report, p22). 
• There would be a significant under-reporting of reactions (if any) against the substances in wine, as most wine 
drinkers and health professionals are probably unaware of the possible presence of isinglass. They would most 
likely blame other substances including alcohol or food if adverse reactions occurred. 
• Dr Andreas Lopata from the Allergy Research Group at RMIT University stated in an ABC radio interview on 
Thursday, 2 October 2008 that, ‘It is not really known if isinglass itself actually can cause an anaphylactic 
reaction in fish-allergic people. The major allergens in fish are normally found in the flesh of the fish but in 
some rare cases also collagen can cause allergies. And isinglass contains this particular collagen which is 
found in fish so theoretically it can cause in select individuals….an anaphylactic reaction.’ 
• The first of the reasons for preferred approach by FSANZ to grant an exemption is that it ‘does not raise any 
safety concerns for fish-allergic consumers.’ However, the second objective for the assessment of the 
application is to ‘ensure the protection of the public health and safety of consumers who are allergenic to 
fish.’ Is there any reason why only safety is referred to in the reasons for preferred approach? 
• Allowing an exemption will undermine the provision of adequate information on the product label to make an 
informed choice by vegetarians and vegans who will find the ‘extremely low’ levels of isinglass present in 
beer and wine as unsuitable for vegetarian diets. 
• Research commissioned by the Sanitarium Health Food Company in 2000 found 2% of Australians reported 
being vegetarian. 
• It is of little use in addressing the vegetarian/vegan issue by stating ‘FSANZ is considering Application A545 
on vegetarian labelling.’ The Work Plan on FSANZ website notes that it was received on 23 August 2004, 
starting in 4th quarter of 2006 and initial assessment to the Board in February 2009. Accordingly, clarification 
is requested. 
• It is disappointing that FSANZ chose not to show this cost in the benefit cost analysis since the issue of 
vegetarian labelling was identified following the release of the Initial Assessment Report. 
• Resources across government, industry and other stakeholders could be better utilised if the issue of allergen 
declaration generally was addressed at one time rather than by a ‘case-by-case’ type basis.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Allergy New Zealand Public Health • Supports, in-principle, the granting of exemptions of mandatory labelling, as long as there is undisputed 
evidence that the ingredient: 
- is proven to be clinically safe for all individuals allergic to that allergen, and 
- has been manufactured to strict standards that are monitored and assured by the regulatory authority who 
has granted the exemption. 
• Concerned that there is insufficient clinical proof that isinglass ‘does not raise any safety concerns for fish-
allergic consumers’ as stated in FSANZ’s reasons for preferred approach.   
• Accepts that evidence to date indicates that isinglass-fined beer and wine are not likely to present a risk of 
allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers, however, this does not indicate that there is no risk. 
• The FSANZ report states that there are no documented reports of allergic reactions to beer or wine fined 
isinglass in fish-allergic consumers. However, many food-allergic reactions are never reported to an authority 
or medical practitioner. Furthermore, there is no requirement in New Zealand for food-allergic reactions to be 
reported by health professionals to a regulatory authority, nor to document the reaction in a published journal.  
Therefore, questions the safety of this being used as evidence of no risk. 
• Two areas of concern regarding the manufacturers of isinglass and use in the wine and beer industry: 
- how will the manufacturing standard be monitored, and 
- wine and beer manufacturers may source isinglass from another manufacturer in a country with less 
stringent manufacturing standards. 
• Fish-allergic individuals are entitled to make an informed choice. 
• If beer and wine industry’s concern is borne out of the use of the term ‘fish’ on their labels, why not permit the 
use of the term ‘isinglass’? This will only be of concern to those consumers who are allergic to fish, who 
would then be advised to avoid products using isinglass. 
• With ongoing research internationally, the situation may become a lot clearer in regard to the risks to fish-
allergic consumers of isinglass-fined wine and beer. It is therefore recommended that FSANZ, in whatever 
decision it takes in regard to this Application, undertakes to review it within 5 years, or sooner if clearer 
evidence becomes available.

Daniel Beecher Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• FSANZ legally required to act in consistency with Australian and international law, regardless of the limited 
scope of Application A490.  As such, despite being beyond the scope of the application, the following 
objections are immediately relevant to FSANZ’s review of Application A490, since they are directly relevant 
to the legality of FSANZ’s proposed outcome. 
• FSANZ’s reasons are irrelevant to the issues raised in this submission. The relevant facts are: 
1.  that the previous decision was the only legally valid decision that FSANZ could make, and 
2.  that FSANZ would be breaking the law by overturning the previous decision 
3.  any past oversights of FSANZ’s legal responsibilities should not be used as an excuse for making further 
breaches of Australian law 
• For FSANZ to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass would be a breach of current Australian law 
regarding the human rights of vegetarians and vegans. Particularly human rights and anti discrimination laws, 
statutory bills of rights, and UN conventions. 
• The onus is now upon FSANZ to immediately consider the impact of their actions (such as the proposed 
approval of Application A490) upon the legally protected human rights of vegetarians and vegans. As such, 
the submitter formally requests that FSANZ immediately desist from approving the Application, or from 
making any other decisions that allow food manufacturers to reduce or remove the capacity of vegetarians or 
vegans to be aware of animal derived ingredients within foodstuffs. 
• The submission provides references (available upon request) to current law that would be contravened if 
FSANZ were to remove the labelling requirement for isinglass. 
Linda Cuthbertson Consumer • Does not support the Application as a vegetarian. 
• In order to select wine, the label is checked for fish products and bottles are excluded that fits that category. 
• It is becoming increasingly difficult to find wines that do not include fish products but the statement on the 
label enables wines to be chosen that are suitable for vegetarians. 
• It would be more useful if the label was more specific; the words ‘may contain’ are somewhat vague. 
• The warning should be retained for dietary purposes so that vegetarians are able to select wines that have no 
fish content.  
 42
Submitter  Sector Comments 
Emma Delaney Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• As a vegan, relies on labels being truthful to make an informed decision. If not informed of a particular 
ingredient, such as a fish product, it is not clear if the product is vegan. 
• The ingredient could cause an allergic response in some individuals, even if reaction may only be mild it 
should be up to the individual with the allergy to decide if they are going to take the risk, not up to companies 
who do not want to lose profits. 
• The consumer deserves to know exactly what it is that they are consuming whether they avoid certain 
ingredients due to ethical reasons, health reason or other reasons.  
• If fish products are taken off beer and wine labels, the submitter will no longer try new wines as will not be 
able to trust that the label is truthful and the only choice will be to assume that fish has been used. Therefore, 
the submitter will only buy wines that are labelled as vegan. This will affect the consumer and the profits of 
the companies involved. Consumers with an allergy to fish would make a similar decision.  
Lynsey Edgar Consumer • Does not support the Application as a wine consumer who is very allergic to fish. 
• Suffered an allergic reaction 6 months ago and another time subsequently whilst drinking white wine. On both 
occasions, the label indicated that fish products were used in the clarifying process. 
• If exemption is permitted, it will be impossible for consumers to determine if fish products are present. How 
are consumers who are allergic to fish, ever to be sure they will not experience a reaction to white wine?  
Information on the label is the only way to be sure, prior to drinking wine, that the consumer will not 
experience an allergic reaction. 
• Consumers are entitled to full disclosure of the food products used in producing wine, to make an informed 
decision, particularly where the decision can affect their health. 
• If exemption allowed, the consumer will have to maintain own ‘safe’ list of wines that they can consume. This 
will curtail purchasing choices as they will not stray from list of known, non-allergy inducing wines. 
Eleanor Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Sister ate a fish that contained an almost lethal dose of ciguatera toxin. She was hospitalised and semi-
conscious for a week and not mentally herself for 6 months following. 10 years later she experienced another 
reaction from paper handled by another person who had eaten fish and continues to get these types of 
reactions from other people who have handled fish. The toxin firstly stops her thinking but still functioning 
and then stops her functioning. Therefore, anything that contains fish derived items should be labelled for the 
wellbeing of all.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Diane Francis Consumer • Does not support the Application.   
• As a vegetarian, does not consume fish and therefore, relies on correct labelling of food and beverage 
products. 
• Why should wine be exempt from responsible labelling? 
Ron Hewit Consumer • Does not support the Application due to vegan interests. 
• The exemption of isinglass labelling in wines will prevent people not wishing to eat fish products from 
consuming any wine as they cannot tell from the label. 
• Labels must state if traces of egg whites are used (as opposed to bentonite or similar clarifiers), so there 
should not be any exemption for fish products.  
• Other foodstuffs from soups, biscuits and noodles must state if fish or crustacea are included in the product. 
This permits a choice for those who do not wish to consume these products whether for allergenic, religious, 
health, or animal welfare reasons.  
• Without the isinglass labels, wine that does not include this product will be penalised because some people 
will not purchase any wine for fear of unlabelled isinglass traces.  
• It seems a poor reason to request an exemption just because wine makers don’t wish to include a fish product 
label.   
• All foodstuffs should be labelled with all products, it helps indicate the cleanliness and purity of the 
manufacturing process; traces of unpleasant products should be declared, people need the choice.  
Ruth Jackson Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Removing isinglass from labelling will not allow consumers to make informed choices about purchasing beer 
and wine.  
• Ethics in business is not fundamentally a question of whether it is right or wrong to tell the truth…rather 
ethics in business is fundamentally a question of implementing and maintaining communication systems 
which question, discuss and validate ethical claims.  
• Exempting isinglass from labelling effectively takes away the ability of each individual to judge for 
themselves whether they want to consume a product that contains fish. It is misleading or deceptive because it 
does not provide adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices.  
• Submitter does not want to drink beer or wine with fish products, so the only option would be to stop drinking 
alcoholic products unless know they do not contain isinglass.  
• It is honest to label what is in a product, no matter how minute it is.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Lynda Kriflik Consumer • Does not support the Application for vegetarian/vegan interests. 
• The removal of notification of isinglass in wines is problematic for another group of consumers other than 
those that suffer allergies. Consumers who choose not to eat or intake animal products will be severely 
disadvantaged by the removal of warnings indicating that isinglass was used as the refining agent.  
• Failure to advise consumers of the refining agent is inadequate ‘provision on the product label to make 
informed choices’ by any consumers. 
• Vegetarians/vegans use label information to avoid products that contain rennet or gelatin, both animal 
products, and expect that labels would also allow them to avoid fish products, regardless of the quantity, as 
they choose not to include any ‘fellow creatures’ in their diet.  
• Submitter has contacted several viniculturalists to express concern that such advice is an ethical recognition of 
the right to choose dietary intake. 
Lefki Pavlidis Consumer • Strongly disagrees with the Application.  
• Wishes to know all the ingredients contained in any product for human consumption. 
• The small traces of fish in beer & wine may or may not cause allergic reactions in people with fish allergies, 
but FSANZ must also consider the many people who choose not to consume anything that contains animal 
ingredients for ethical reasons.  
• Manufacturers should be up-front and provide a full list of ingredients used in the production of their 
products, so consumers can make the right purchasing decisions according to ethical beliefs. 
Kathryn Puxty Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Labelling is essential for vegetarians and vegans to be able to make an informed decision about which wines 
they can and can't drink to follow their chosen diet. Whether or not there are significant traces remaining in 
the wine is irrelevant. The fact that it has been produced using fish (or milk or eggs) is sufficient to make it 
unsuitable. If this exemption goes ahead then the range of wines that vegetarians and vegans can drink will be 
greatly limited as we won't know what is suitable and what is not.  
• If this exemption is granted then an acceptable, or perhaps preferable, alternative would be to make it 
mandatory to label all wines, or in fact all alcohol, as being suitable for vegetarians and vegans. This is 
something that many food brands currently do, though they are not obligated to do so.  
• The wine industry is overreacting the negative reaction of general consumers to the labelling of fish products, 
since rarely anyone ever reads the labels, and those that do are people with allergies or special diets that make 
label and ingredient checking a normal part of life. 
• If labelling is going to be insufficient then the only other option is to avoid products that we cannot be sure 
about. This will also have a negative impact on many producers in the wine and alcohol industry.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Penny Rankin Consumer • Does not support the Application as an allergy sufferer. 
• The argument that the amount of fish products in wine is so small they could not be harmful is not true. 
• Submitter experienced an allergic reaction after only 2 sips of wine containing fish products and seaweed and 
now checks wine labels very carefully.  Submitter is dangerously allergic to seaweed which causes angio 
oedema and can be fatal. 
• Need to ensure labels continue to list ingredients such as isinglass, fish products and seaweed, so allergy 
sufferers can avoid them and stay alive without requiring emergency tracheotomies. 
Jessica Robinson Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• In the interests of both consumers who have, for ethical, religious, or personal reasons, an opposition to the 
use of fish products in their consumables, and also the general public for the basic reason that every consumer 
has a right to know exactly how a product has been produced.  
• People who have adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet do not purchase beer or wine that has been brewed using 
isinglass. If there are no standards, these groups of people will not know which products are appropriate for 
them, causing unnecessary stress, uncertainty and inconveniences. 
• Understands that the association has concerns that consumers may be put off purchasing a product if they read 
that it has been produced using fish products. However, it is essentially the responsibility of the consumer to 
educate themselves in the process of beer and wine production, and omitting certain information from the 
labels is insulting to the informed consumer and a tactical cover-up of the truth. It does not change the fact 
that these products are used. If a consumer takes issue with the production process then they have the right to 
research and make an informed decision about where they place their purchasing power.  
• It is quite clear that the driving force behind the application is the prospect of higher sales for the beer and 
wine industry, and accepting their proposal would mean sacrificing the moral duty of a producer of 
consumables to be truthful. 
John Wakerman Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Whilst labelling may or may not be important for those with fish allergies, it is important for those who 
simply wish to be informed about what they consume, in whatever concentration. Accurate labelling is also 
important for those with religious or other beliefs, be they Muslims or vegans.  
• Where isinglass is used and residual is to be found in beers or wines, it should be thus labelled, regardless of 
allergenicity. Only thus will consumers be able to make informed choices and not be misled about the content 
of common foodstuffs or drinks.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Tara Ward Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Submission focuses on the objectives of FSANZ, specifically ‘the provision of adequate information relating 
to food to enable consumers to make informed choices’. 
• The focus of the application and Draft Assessment Report was limited to consumers of beer and wine who are 
allergic to fish.  This submission considers the impact on all consumers of beer and wine, rather than merely 
those who are allergic to fish. 
• The requirement to declare isinglass on beer and wine labels allows consumers to make informed choices 
about food based on political, religious and/or ethical preferences, including preferences not to purchase 
products made using animals or fish.   
• To date, a major obstacle for consumers wishing to make informed food choices has been improper or 
insufficient labelling. The preferred regulatory approach of granting the exemption will only exacerbate this 
trend.  In the absence of mandatory labelling systems for products containing, or produced with, animal or 
fish products, this submission urges that exemption not be granted. 
• According to the Report, the requirement to declare the use of isinglass does not provide accurate information 
for fish-allergic consumers to make an informed choice. It is difficult to understand how the declaration on a 
label of factual information regarding the production system associated with a product does not count as 
‘accurate’ information. 
• The mandatory requirement regarding isinglass is not to make assertions about the possibility of an allergic 
reaction to it, but merely to declare that it was used in the production of food in question.  Removing such 
factual information would diminish the ability of consumers to make an informed choice, as it would conceal 
the nature of the process used to produce the food. 
• Retaining the existing limitations of the requirement avoids the need to alter the information on labels 
according to the changing nature of research findings regarding isinglass and/or the changing social 
conscience of consumers. 
• If there is concern about the general level of awareness regarding the potential (or lack thereof) for allergic 
reactions to isinglass, it would be better to continue the requirement to declare its use, and as well to provide 
additional information on relevant websites and other sources. 
• Should the requirement to declare isinglass be removed, it would reduce choice for consumers who do not 
wish to buy wine or beer where it is unclear whether its production involved the use of isinglass. If consumers 
concerned about the use of fish products were to cease purchasing wine or beer that does not declare the 
presence of isinglass, this may result in a cost to certain sectors of the industry.

Submitter  Sector Comments 
Sharnie Wu Consumer • Does not support the Application. 
• Submitter spoke to the allergy clinic at Royal Price Alfred Hospital since original submission, who suggested 
that isinglass is not a major allergy threat. 
• Therefore, the main reason to label is the need for transparency for consumers who want to know what the 
product inputs are. Isinglass uses an animal product and consumers need to know this to make informed 
choices with their purchase. 
• Many vegetarians and vegans would not buy these wines if they knew that fish had been killed in the process 
of making them. It is their right to know what they are buying. People have a fundamental civil right to know 
the truth of what they are putting into their own bodies and make the appropriate decisions. 
• It is up to the wine industry to market appropriately to avoid the stigma of using fish products. 
• Also for consideration is the possible environmental impact of using isinglass. In this world of fish 
populations being severely depleted by overfishing, climate change and ocean pollution, is it absolutely 
necessary to use fish for an incremental gain in the taste of wine which the wine producers are too 
embarrassed to tell the public about? 
• The ultimate goal of FSANZ is ‘A safe food supply and well-informed customers’. The people of Australia 
and NZ hold FSANZ to this task.

Risk Assessment Report  
 
Definition:  Isinglass is a processing aid derived from the swim bladder of tropical and 
subtropical fish species for use as a fining/clarifying agent. 
 
Risk Assessment 
 
1. General 
 
1.1 Fish allergy - parvalbumin 
 
Allergy to vertebrate fin fish is well documented in the scientific and clinical literature, 
including double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies. Fish muscle, 
skin and roe have been reported to cause allergic reactions, the latter only rarely (Sicherer et 
al., 2000; Escudero et al., 2007). Allergic reactions to the consumption of fish/fish products 
may include life-threatening anaphylaxis. Fish allergy reportedly affects 0.4% of the US adult 
population (Sampson, 2004); but there are currently no data on the prevalence of fish allergy 
in the Australian and New Zealand adult population.   
 
Parvalbumins are a class of calcium-binding proteins found at highest concentration in fast 
contracting/relaxing muscle fibres of vertebrates. In fish, parvalbumins are generally 
associated with skeletal muscle. Parvalbumins have molecular weights of approximately  
10-13 kDa, and acidic pI values
2. Parvalbumins are water soluble and resistant to heat 
treatment and enzymatic degradation (Aas and Elsayed, 1975-[as cited in Chen et al. 2006]).  
 
Parvalbumins are the allergenic fish proteins, and possibly the sole allergens for most 
individuals with IgE-mediated allergy to fish. Parvalbumin is the allergen in several fish 
species including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel and tuna. Parvalbumin sequences from 
commonly consumed fish species are highly homologous. This would indicate a high 
likelihood of IgE cross-reactivity to a range of fish species for at least some fish-allergic 
individuals (Swoboda et al., 2002; Hilger et al., 2004; Van Do, 2005).  
 
There is limited information on the potential allergenicity of fish collagen. In a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) study, a mild, subjective reaction was reported 
by one out of 30 fish-allergic patients given 7.6 g codfish skin gelatine (Hansen et al., 2004).  
 
1.2 Fish swim bladder – anatomical location and tissue composition 
 
The swim bladder is an air sac located in the dorsal part of the body cavity of most fish 
species. As such, it can be readily detached without significant contamination with the fish 
muscle tissue. The swim bladders from certain tropical and subtropical fish species are used 
to prepare commercial isinglass.  
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen and its denatured product, gelatin. 
Isinglass also contains small quantities of elastin, a highly hydrophobic, 72 kDa protein. 
Collagen, gelatin and elastin constitute about 95% of the dry weight of isinglass.
                                                
 
2 The pH at which the protein is least soluble.     
 49
There is no evidence to suggest that elastin is allergenic and, as mentioned above, the clinical 
relevance of collagen/gelatin allergenicity has not been shown.   
 
Collagen is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa and is present in fish 
muscle, skin and swim bladder. The fish swim bladder is the source of collagen, known 
commercially as isinglass. Intact collagen has a triple helical structure stabilised by cross 
linkages. Soluble collagen exists mainly as trimers and tetramers with a molecular weight of 
800-1300 kDa. The large size of collagen contrasts with known allergenic proteins, which are 
usually small, compact proteins with molecular weight ranging between 10 kDa and 80 kDa. 
 
Collagen is thermally labile and denatures to gelatin, where the triple helix is unwound to 
form random coils. Collagen from tropical fish species is most suitable for isinglass 
production because it remains intact in temperatures up to 29ºC, while collagen from 
coldwater fish species denatures at about 5ºC. There is no evidence that gelatin is a clinically 
important allergen in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
1.3 The hazard and the risk  
 
For fish-allergic consumers, fish parvalbumin is the relevant allergen of significance i.e. the 
hazard. The FSANZ risk assessment process considers that the hazard is the potential
 to 
cause an adverse reaction and the risk is the likelihood of the adverse reaction actually 
occurring within the conditions of exposure. In the context of this Application, the overall 
risk to fish-allergic consumers is dependent on the level of exposure to parvalbumin through 
the consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine.   
 
2. Beer-related data 
 
Information in this section is mainly extracted from documents provided by the Applicant to 
FSANZ in 2008 (originally submitted by the Brewers of Europe and the Brewing, Food and 
Beverage Industry Suppliers Association to EFSA in 2006).  
 
2.1 Analytical methods used in beer studies 
 
2.1.1 Isinglass detection   
 
A method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in fined beers can be 
concentrated using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to pure isinglass. The separated 
isinglass can then be hydrolysed to its constituent acids and quantified by measuring the 
content of hydroxyproline, an imino acid characteristic of animal collagens. The limit of 
detection (LOD) of this method is 0.17 mg isinglass/L of beer. Information provided by the 
Applicant indicates this method was used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues 
which could be present in beer. 
 
2.1.2 Parvalbumin detection   
 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fish parvalbumin was used to measure 
parvalbumin levels in swim bladders, isinglass and beer. Using monoclonal antibody directed 
against carp parvalbumin, a competitive ELISA was developed and found to be capable of 
detecting 0.05 µg/ml of carp parvalbumin (or 1 µg/g).  
  
 50
An improved method was developed based on anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibodies 
which would have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider range of fish 
species. The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not substantially cross-react with 
common food ingredients. The sensitivity of the anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA was shown to 
be 0.20 µg/g. However, using the sandwich ELISA to measure parvalbumin levels in 
isinglass samples suggests the possibility of matrix inhibition of two to four-fold. Therefore, 
quantitative estimates of parvalbumin levels need to take this into account.    
 
2.2 Parvalbumin in fish swim bladd er and in isinglass preparations 
 
Although parvalbumin is not a major component of the swim bladder, it has been identified in 
the swim bladder tissue of a western Atlantic fish (Opsanus tau or the oyster toadfish), a 
species not used in isinglass production. This information raised the question whether 
parvalbumin may also be present in the swim bladders of some fish species that are used in 
the commercial production of isinglass. The Applicant provided analytical data on 
parvalbumin levels in eight isinglass samples from three commercial manufacturers. Using 
the anti-cod parvalbumin ELISA, six samples were below 10 µg/g, one sample at 34 µg/g and 
one below 1 µg/g. Various levels of parvalbumin were detected in the swim bladder of seven 
fish species. According to this information, it is possible to minimise the level of parvalbumin 
in isinglass by identifying and eliminating fish species with high levels of parvalbumin.   
 
Parvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions, at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, 
making it possible to further minimise residual levels of parvalbumin in isinglass by 
incorporating a washing step in the manufacturing process. The Applicant provided analytical 
data which indicates that significant reduction of residual parvalbumin in isinglass is 
achieved after washing with a phosphate buffer. The effect of different washing procedures 
on parvalbumin levels was tested. The most effective washing process appears to reduce 
parvalbumin level by about four-fold.  
 
To ensure minimum parvalbumin content in isinglass, the Applicant indicated that a new 
Code of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the manufacture of isinglass low in 
parvalbumin has been developed and agreed by the industry. The new GMP Code 
incorporates an additional washing step using phosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving 
step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall particle size does not exceed  
25 mm, and the exclusion of fish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. 
Data presented by the Applicant shows that parvalbumin residues in eight samples of 
commercial isinglass, prepared using the new GMP, are below 1 µg/g.  
   
2.3 Residues of isinglass and parvalbumin in fined beer 
 
Information provided by the Applicant states that residual amounts of isinglass in bottle and 
can beer are below the LOD and where detectable, do not exceed 1 mg/L. For keg and cask 
beer, isinglass residues are at 3-5 mg/L.  
 
Experiments were conducted using ELISA methods in order to determine whether detectable 
parvalbumin remained in the fined beer. Samples of beer fined with isinglass, containing 
various levels of parvalbumin, were freeze-dried and tested. Data provided indicates that no 
parvalbumin could be detected in the beer samples, which included lager and cask ale.  
  
 51
Theoretical calculations suggest that parvalbumin levels would be below the level of 
detection of the ELISA method used in these tests.   
 
Since parvalbumin residues in beer are too low to measure, the Applicant provided an 
estimate of potential parvalbumin based on the following information:  
 
• The dose of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/L. This is around the highest dose which 
would be used commercially for cask beers and is 2-3 times higher than the dose used 
for most brewery-conditioned beers.  
• Residual levels of isinglass in beer, when detectable, range from 1 mg/L for can and 
bottle beer to 5 mg/L for cask beer. Even in cloudy beer, the level is not reported to 
exceed 5 mg/L. 
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products currently on the market (old 
protocol) is 10 µg/g (cod equivalent) on a dry weight basis.   
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products using the new GMP protocol is 
1 µg/g. 
• Parvalbumin most likely co-sediments with isinglass residue and does not partition into 
the fluid part of the beer (see section 2.4 below). 
 
Based on this information, parvalbumin levels in beer are calculated to be 0.001 µg/L for 
bottle and can beer, and 0.005 µg/L for cask-conditioned beer using isinglass prepared 
according to the new protocol. For traditionally prepared isinglass, the levels are estimated to 
be ten times higher at 0.01 µg/L and 0.05 µg/L for can and cask beer, respectively. These 
estimated levels of parvalbumin are considered, together with oral challenge studies, in the 
exposure assessment.   
 
2.4 Parvalbumin levels in beer sediments 
 
Parvalbumin is soluble in water and dilute salt solutions at neutral and alkaline pH. Data 
provided by the Applicant indicates that the level of parvalbumin in isinglass can be 
minimised by washing in buffer solution. For any residual parvalbumin, which is not 
eliminated from isinglass, there are two potential scenarios. Parvalbumin residues would 
either end up in the sediment or in the fluid. In the acidic environment of beer brewing, 
parvalbumin would be expected to precipitate with the isinglass to form the sediment. 
Analytical data provided by the Applicant suggests this to be the case.   
 
Isinglass commercially prepared using the old protocol (which assumes a typical parvalbumin 
content of 10 µg/g as determined by cod parvalbumin ELISA) was added to beer at a dose of 
36 mg/L (0.36 µg parvalbumin/L) of beer. The sediment was collected and tested for 
parvalbumin content using the cod parvalbumin ELISA. The results suggest that parvalbumin 
content in isinglass is concentrated in the sediment and therefore, is unlikely to be present in 
the clear portion of the beer.     
 
2.5 Clinical testing 
 
2.5.1 Skin prick tests 
 
Skin prick testing (SPT) provides information about the presence of IgE antibody specific to 
a given allergen. Although SPT for food allergy is valid, interpretation can be complex and 
positive tests often occur without clinical allergy (ASCIA-SPT Manual 2006).  
 52
The Applicant provided information on skin prick tests performed using extracts from a 
number of the fish species that are used in the manufacture of commercial isinglass. Flesh 
and swim bladder extracts were prepared from six fish species, and checked for microbial 
contamination to eliminate false positive due to non-allergic inflammation. SPT was 
performed on eight fish-allergic individuals according to a protocol developed at the Food 
Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP). Samples of blood were also taken from 
the individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. All eight patients tested were positive 
when skin tested with fish flesh extracts. Seven of eight patients were positive with fish swim 
bladder extracts.  
 
Information was also provided by the Applicant on a separate study conducted in France 
where six patients with verified fish allergy were challenged with commercial isinglass. Two 
of the six patients were skin-test positive, but all six patients were negative in the oral 
challenge test (see below). 
 
These skin prick test results, when considered in conjunction with the oral challenge results 
conducted on the same patients, do not appear to be clinically relevant. This is because 
individuals may have allergen-specific IgE which leads to positive skin prick tests, but do not 
react to oral challenge with the same allergen. This is a well-acknowledged and commonly 
encountered response in food allergy testing.   
 
2.5.2 Oral challenge tests 
 
Controlled oral food challenges are the gold standard in diagnosing food allergy. However, 
the targeted nature of the recruitment and the strict qualifying criteria, including convincing 
clinical history, limits the number of subjects available to participate in such studies.
   
 
In the context of this Application, oral challenges are conducted to determine whether or not 
the test samples (isinglass used as a fining agent) can provoke an allergic reaction in fish-
allergic individuals. 
 
A protocol for DBPCFC tests were developed by FARRP using isinglass prepared according 
to the new protocol. Fish-allergic patients were dosed every half an hour with isinglass 
starting from a low dose and gradually increasing over a period of two hours. The doses used 
were 0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg of isinglass in mashed potatoes. In this study, 15 fish-allergic 
patients were tested but none reacted to the oral challenge with isinglass, even at the very 
highest dose used. Based on parvalbumin content of 1 µg/g isinglass, the total of the 
challenge doses is equivalent to over 50 L of beer (or 10 L of cask beer) exceeding the 
volume that is possible to consume in a single sitting.  
 
Another study was conducted separately in France using isinglass containing 10 µg/g 
parvalbumin.  
According to information provided by the Applicant, this is a typical sample of commercially 
available isinglass. Six patients with allergy to fish, as determined by oral food challenge or 
by a convincing clinical history at the time of the study, were included. Each patient received 
a total of 20 mg of isinglass, mixed with cooked potato, over two hours. None of the patients 
had positive reactions to the oral challenge (while two of the six patients showed positive 
reactions in the skin prick test using the same material). 
  
 53
These two studies, conducted by experts in the field using rigorous protocols, provide 
supporting evidence that isinglass does not pose a safety concern for fish-allergic consumers.    
 
2.6 Exposure assessment 
 
The data suggest that levels of isinglass that may remain in beer do not exceed 1 mg/L for 
bottle or can beer, and 5 mg/L for cask beer. The level of parvalbumin in isinglass is likely to 
vary according to the manufacturing protocol (from 1 µg/g for the new protocol to 10 µg/g 
for the old protocol). No data are available on the level of parvalbumin in beer because it is 
below the LOD for current methodologies. As parvalbumin is known to be insoluble in the 
acidic environment of fermentation, it is expected to co-sediment with isinglass which is 
removed during the beverage production and is not consumed. 
 
FSANZ notes that currently there are no agreed thresholds for any food allergen including 
parvalbumin. A threshold is the lowest dose of the allergen (parvalbumin) that can trigger an 
allergic reaction in fish-allergic individuals. However, the levels of parvalbumin that may be 
consumed in isinglass-fined beer are likely to be very low (estimated to be 0.001-0.005 µg/L 
for new protocol isinglass and ten fold higher at 0.01-0.05 µg/L for old protocol isinglass). 
 
The oral challenge studies indicate that isinglass prepared according to either the old or the 
new protocol did not provoke allergic reactions in any of the 21 fish-allergic individuals. The 
isinglass doses used in these studies and corresponding volumes of beer are as follows: 
 
Isinglass prepared 
according to: 
 
The cumulative oral challenge dose 
(no reactions observed): 
Equivalent volume of beer 
New manufacturing protocol  
 
50.5 mg isinglass 
(isinglass was given in increasing 
dose of 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 
mg in about 40 grams in mashed 
potato over 2 hours) 
50 L of bottle/can beer 
10 L of cask beer 
 
Old manufacturing protocol  
 
20 mg isinglass 20 L of bottle/can beer 
4 L of cask beer 
 
An average drinker of beer may consume about 1.5 L of beer within a single sitting, while a 
heavy drinker of beer may consume up to 3 L of beer within a single sitting. Clearly the dose 
of isinglass tolerated by fish-allergic individuals in the oral challenge studies, as reported by 
the Applicant, far exceeds isinglass levels that may be expected in the volume of beer that 
could be consumed by an individual within a single sitting.  
 
In light of the normal constrains on the volume that can be consumed by an individual within 
a few hours, FSANZ considers that potential exposure to parvalbumin through the 
consumption of beer fined with isinglass is likely to be extremely low.

2.7 Literature search 
 
Two literature searches were provided by the Applicant to demonstrate the rarity of reports 
on beer allergy. The searches, conducted in 2004 and in 2006, had numerous search words 
and covered 33 databases3. These extensive searches have failed to identify any publications 
that may be relevant to fish allergy due to consumption of beer. 
 
3. Wine-related data 
 
Information in this section is derived from documents provided to FSANZ by the Australian 
Wine Research Institute (AWRI) in April 2008; and from EFSA opinion (Request N
o EFSA-
Q-2006-154 – published in the EFSA Journal 2007, 533:1-8).   
 
3.1 Usage of isinglass in wine 
 
Information provided to FSANZ by the AWRI indicates that isinglass is used under GMP (as 
required in the Code under Standard 1.3.3) as a fining agent mainly in the production of white 
wine.  
 
The amount of isinglass used is determined for individual batches to avoid overuse, but 
typically falls between 10-25 mg isinglass/L of wine. Isinglass is removed by sedimentation 
followed by racking, which may include high performance centrifugation or filtration.  
 
3.2 Residual amounts of isinglass in wine 
 
Analytical data, commissioned by the AWRI, is provided for two commercial samples of 
isinglass-fined wine produced according to GMP (Hofman et al., 2002). The analytical 
method is based on partial purification of collagen from the test sample followed by analysis 
using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) technique. 
The wine samples had been fined with 0.42 and 4.4 mg isinglass/L wine, respectively. No 
collagen bands were detected in the wine samples. Using the same method, collagen residues 
could be recovered and detected in beer samples spiked with collagen at concentration of   
1.0 mg/L or more. The AWRI concludes that the concentration of residual isinglass in the 
commercial wine samples is likely to be less than 1 mg/L. This is the same level of residual 
isinglass that has been reported for bottled beer. Parvalbumin, the protein of concern to fish-
allergic consumers, was not detectable in beer samples fined using isinglass prepared 
according to the old or the new protocol. Although no data on parvalbumin detection was 
available for wine, there is no reason to expect the findings would be different from beer. 
Therefore, theoretical levels of parvalbumin, estimated to be 0.001-0.05 µg/L can be 
extrapolated.  
 
In a recently published study, 16 wines were tested for residues of isinglass (Weber et al 
2007). The wines were fined with four commercially available isinglass preparations at 50 or 
250 mL isinglass/100 L wine. 
                                                
 
3 Search words: beer, ale(s), lager, brewery, allergen(s), allergic, allergenicity, allergies, allergenic, 
hypersensitivity, sensitive, anaphylaxis, parvalbumin, isinglass. 
Databases searched included: Analytical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, medline, Registry of toxic Effects, 
Toxline, Food Science & Technology Abstracts, Conference Papers index, Dissertation Abstracts, etc… 
  
 55
No residual isinglass could be detected in any of the wines when a competitive ELISA with 
LOD ≤ 5 µg/L was used. These findings further support results of undetectable isinglass in 
two samples of isinglass-fined Australian wines.  
 
3.3 Potential allergenicity of isinglass-fined wine 
 
An investigation of potential food allergens in fined wine was reported, including full details 
of the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and basophil activation analysis (Rolland 
et al., 2006). The scope of the study included wine fined with isinglass as well as egg and 
milk-derived processing aids. The data relevant to isinglass is outlined below. 
 
3.3.1 Literature search 
 
A search of the medical literature was conducted by the AWRI on PubMed using the terms ‘wine 
AND allergy’. The most commonly-reported adverse reactions among alcoholic beverage 
consumers appear to be associated with sulphite additives. However, the search was unable to 
identify any documented cases of adverse reactions specifically associated with isinglass.  
 
3.3.2 Double-blind placebo-controlled trial -Exposure to isinglass in fined wine 
 
The clinical study included ten fish-allergic subjects recruited from the Allergy Clinics, 
Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. The patients (five females and five males) were diagnosed by 
a clinical allergist with IgE-mediated food allergy, based on a history of anaphylaxis and 
corresponding demonstration of specific IgE to allergens of fish or by skin prick testing. The 
exception was one individual who had negative tests for IgE but a positive oral fish 
challenge. Clinical characteristics of the ten fish-allergic individuals are included in the 
published study (Rolland et al., 2006). 
 
Control subjects, with no IgE to any of the allergens including fish, were also included in the 
study.  
 
All subjects avoided antihistamine medications for three days, short-acting bronchodilator 
therapy for four hours, and long-acting bronchodilator therapy for twelve hours before each 
visit. Alcohol ingestion was avoided for at least three days before challenge, with subjects 
fasted for at least eight hours. 
 
Samples from 23 isinglass-fined wines were used in the study. Controls wines were clarified 
using other non-food protein-processing aids and/or filtration.  
 
Each subject consumed 100 mL (approximately one standard drink) over 10-15 minutes and 
completed a symptom questionnaire by using a visual analogue scale and repeated it at  
15 minute intervals for two hours after challenge. Over the next six days, subjects abstained 
from alcoholic beverages and recorded any possible late reactions in a diary.  
 
The study reported that one fish-allergic subject developed mild lip numbness, which 
resolved spontaneously, after ingestion of a control unfined wine. No subjects developed a 
typical IgE-mediated allergic reaction requiring medical treatment and no diary card 
abnormalities were noted during follow-up.  
  
 56
3.3.3 Basophil activation analysis 
 
An analysis using a modified basophil activation assay was described in the study by Rolland et 
al. (2006). The study reported that one isinglass-fined wine caused weak basophil activation for 
two out of ten fish-allergic subjects, but this same wine was also reported to have caused weak 
activation of basophils from a peanut-allergic subject (who is not allergic to fish). The two fish-
allergic subjects showed no clinical adverse reactions to another wine made using isinglass. 
One of the two fish-allergic subjects showed weak basophil activation to a wine made using 
non-grape tannin but this subject was not allergic to peanuts or tree nuts.   
 
4 Conclusion 
 
The Table to clause 6 in the Standard 1.3.3 (Processing Aids) requires that isinglass is used 
according to GMP. Adherence to GMP in the use of isinglass as a clarifying agent minimises 
the potential level of residual isinglass in the final product. Information provided by the 
Applicant indicates that residual level of isinglass in bottled beer and wine is about 1 mg/L   
 
Low but variable levels of parvalbumin may be present in commercial isinglass. Reducing the 
level of parvalbumin in isinglass even further is technically achievable by incorporating 
steps, including further washing, into the GMP for isinglass manufacturing. The Applicant 
states that the revised GMP is now widely adopted by the isinglass manufacturers which 
supply the Australian and New Zealand markets. Using currently available detection 
methods, parvalbumin was not detectable in isinglass-fined beer regardless of whether the 
isinglass was prepared according to the old or new protocol. 
 
Together, the GMP for the production of isinglass and the GMP for the use of isinglass in the 
fining of beer and wine, provide a high level of safety that counteracts uncertainties identified 
in this paper. The uncertainties relate to the newly developed analytical methodologies used 
in generating the data provided by the Applicant, the lack of information on the prevalence of 
fish allergy among the adult population in Australia and New Zealand, and the lack of an 
agreed threshold for parvalbumin.  
 
Therefore, FSANZ considers that consumption of isinglass-fined beer and wine is not likely 
to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic consumers.

Summary 
 
Isinglass is derived from fish swim bladders and is used as a clarifying agent in the brewing 
and wine industry. The rod-like helical structure and amphoteric nature (able to be both an 
acid and base) of the isinglass collagen are responsible for isinglass’s clarification properties. 
The yeast cells, polyphenolic and protein substances form complexes with the isinglass and 
settle to the bottom of the fermentation vessels, thereby assisting in clarifying the liquid.    
 
Residual isinglass in packaged beer and wine has been shown to be removed by the filtration 
process, whereas cask conditioned beer (which is unfiltered) would require sufficient 
sedimentation time to ensure all the isinglass has time to settle and form a stable mass at the 
bottom of the cask. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) needs to be followed when isinglass 
is utilised as a clarifying agent to ensure the minimum possible residue of isinglass in the 
finished product. 
 
The isinglass may potentially contain the protein parvalbumin, a known fish allergen. The 
level of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be minimised by establishing and adopting a 
manufacturing Code of Practice which is intended to reduce the level of parvalbumin.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
Isinglass is used extensively as a processing aid in the brewing and wine industry to improve 
the efficiency of the fining process (also called clarification) of beer and wine. Isinglass has 
been used for several centuries for this purpose. An estimated 200 tonnes of isinglass is used 
annually to clarify an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide. 
 
2. Production process of isinglass 
 
Isinglass is a collagen derived from dried swim bladders of specific tropical and subtropical 
fish. The traditional basic production process may vary between manufacturers, which can 
also depend on the source and species of the fish and does not seem to have a high level of 
standardisation (EFSA, 2007). The main steps involve blending swim bladders of specified 
fish to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply; granulation to reduce the size; washing in 
chilled water, sterilizing in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution and final rinsing with water. 
The sterilised granulated swim bladder is then further processed to different product forms 
such as powder, paste, ready-to-use paste and dry parchment or matted form. The three main 
forms of commercial isinglass are summarised below.  
 
2.1 Isinglass powder 
 
The sterilised hydrated isinglass is extruded using narrow apertures, which disrupts the 
collagen fibres.  It is then dried and milled into a powder of less than 1000 microns.   
  
 59
2.2 Isinglass paste  
 
The sterilised hydrated isinglass is macerated to less than 1000 microns paste by high shear 
mixing with the addition of sodium or potassium metabisulphite (as preservative). The paste 
is standardised to about 10% solids. 
 
2.3 Ready-to-use paste 
 
The isinglass paste can be further diluted then acidified with food grade acids to a pH of 2.0-3.0. 
The solids level is typically 0.3-1.5%. Sulphur dioxide is often used as a preservative. 
 
2.4 The new manufacturing protoc ol for isinglass production  
 
An industry-agreed GMP for isinglass has been adopted by the major suppliers of isinglass to 
ensure the presence of parvalbumin can be minimised. This GMP includes an additional 
washing stage using a phosphate buffer and successive washing steps with fresh water, the 
introduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim bladder wall size 
does not exceed 25 mm and the exclusion of certain fish species. Some fish species appear to 
have low levels of parvalbumin and therefore, have been specifically included in the new 
GMP (EFSA, 2007). 
 
3. Physico-chemical characteristics and technological function of isinglass 
 
3.1 Functions and characteristics 
 
A fining agent such as isinglass is added to beer and wine to reduce or remove the presence 
of one or more undesirable components in order to achieve clarity and potentially improve 
sensory appeal, flavour and physical stability in the final product (Morris and Main, 1995). 
 
The major component of isinglass is type 1 collagen (95%) along with small amounts of 
gelatine, its denaturation product (Hickman et al., 2000; EFSA, 2007). The isinglass collagen 
exists as a rod-like triple helical molecule, amphoteric in nature (able to be both an acid and 
base) and is thermally labile, denaturing at about 29
oC to form the random coils of gelatine 
(Hickman et al., 2000). However, the fish allergen, parvalbumins, present mainly in fish 
muscles and at low levels in fish bladders, seems to be heat stable after heating for three 
hours at 90oC (Arif et al., 2007). The parvalbumin has a pI (isoelectric point) of around  
3.9-5.5 (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000). 
 
Isinglass collagen has a molecular weigh of 800-1300 kDa and contains hydroxyproline in its 
structure, which is important to its functionality (EFSA, 2007). The rod-like structural 
integrity of the collagen triple helix was hypothesised to be crucial for efficient clarification 
(Hickman et al., 2000). However, a more popular hypothesis of the fining activity is based 
upon charge interactions. The isinglass is assumed to electronically attract yeast cells with 
negatively charged cell walls and other suspended charged polyphenolic and protein 
components. These aggregated complexes would then settle to the bottom of the container. In 
the sediment, further interactions may take place resulting in firm sediment that is resistant to 
disturbance when the clear beverage is drawn off.  
  
 60
3.2 Clarifying process procedure in the brewing industry 
 
In the brewing process, after fermentation, the beer is cooled to around freezing, which 
encourages settling of the yeast and causes proteins to coagulate and settle out with the yeast. 
Similar to the wine production process, it is at this stage that isinglass powder dissolved in 
dilute solutions of food grade acids is added to the fermented beer to aid in the clarifying 
process. The pH of beer is typically between 3.9 and 4.6 (Siebert and Lynn, 2005). At this 
pH, isinglass is positively charged (iso-electric point of isinglass is around 5.5) and thus 
attracting and aggregating negatively charged particles. However, if the pH of the beer is 
below 3.5, the fining activity is severely inhibited (Ward, 2008).    
 
For optimum fining performance, beer must be fined at the coldest point in the process. The 
reason is that if the chill haze (from protein precipitation) is present prior to isinglass 
addition, it is then readily removed by fining. This is especially important for cask beer, since 
there are no effective alternatives to the use of isinglass in producing bright unfiltered beer 
(Ward 2008).   
 
Information provided by the Applicant suggests that the brewing industry typically uses 
isinglass at a low level of between 10-15 mg/L but this level can potentially go as high as    
60 mg/L in some brews. The sediment formed by the collagen and yeast complex is removed 
by filtration and/or the centrifugation processes, resulting in very low residual levels of 
isinglass in the final product. Cask conditioned beer does not undergo filtration or 
centrifugation and relies on gravity settling.  
 
3.3 Clarification function of isingl ass in wine production process  
 
The flowchart in Figure 1 below shows generalised processing steps of white wine. The red 
wine process is expected to be similar. The fining step, where isinglass is usually added, 
occurs after alcohol fermentation has been completed and before filtration. The main purpose 
is to aggregate polymeric carbohydrates, proteins and polyphenols to form larger aggregates 
that sink to the bottom. Such aggregation improves the filtering efficiency as a consequence 
by initially clarifying the wine (Wucherpfenning, 2003).  
 
Three different types of filters are commonly used in wine filtration; precoat filter, sheet filter 
and membrane filter, which are membranes of different pore size that can be used to remove 
particles down to the molecular level from the wine.   
 
After the fining and filtration process, the wine is normally sufficiently clear and has a pH 
value ranged from 2.8-4.0, depending on the types of wine (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). 
Some wines are subjected to further cold stabilisation before they are ready for development 
to maturity and bottled. 
 
Isinglass is claimed to be a preferred clarification agent compared to egg or casein, because 
of its mild effect on flavour. Different batches of wine require different amounts of isinglass, 
as determined by laboratory tests. In Australia, isinglass is typically added at between 
approximately 20-50 mg/L in the production of wine (Wine Australia, 2008), in New 
Zealand, use in wine is typically about 6-10 mg/L (New Zealand Winegrowers, 2008) and use 
in white wine in France is typically between 10-25 mg/L (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). In 
both Australia and New Zealand isinglass is considered as the best and most expensive 
clarifying agent and is not likely to be used in excess if usage is not warranted.

3.3 Good Manufacturing practice for usage of Isinglass  
  
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a requirement in regulating the maximum amount of 
the isinglass which may be present in a food. The relevant GMP criteria for isinglass are: 
 
(a) the quantity added to food shall be limited to the lowest possible level necessary to 
accomplish its desired effect;  
 
(b) the quantity that becomes a component of f ood as a result of its use in the manufacture, 
processing or packaging of a food and which is not intended to accomplish any 
physical, or other technical effect in the finished food itself, is reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible; and 
 
(c) the material is prepar ed and handled in the same way as a food ingredient. 
 
4. Allergenic residue issues 
 
4.1 Parvalbumin as the allergen 
 
Parvalbumin has been identified as a fish allergen, based mainly on studies of three species of 
fish: Atlantic salmon, carp and Japanese horse mackerel.

Further immuno-blotting analyses led to the conclusion that parvalbumin is the major fish 
albumin independent of fish species (Hamada et al., 2001). Parvalbumin is generally 
associated with skeletal muscle tissue, even though the presence of parvalbumin has 
previously been detected in swim bladders of fish not used for isinglass manufacture (Feher 
et al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).   
 
4.2 Reported studies on residues of isinglass in beer and wine 
 
It was reported that the filtration process removed all isinglass residues in filtered beer during 
the process, tested using a HPLC method that can detect amino acids concentration as low as 
3.9 x 10-13 mg/L. However, the study showed that in order for the cask beer to be free of 
isinglass, sufficient time is required for the sediment to settle properly before dispensing 
(Chlup et al., 2006). 
 
A recent study investigated the manufacturing processes on the removal of a range of fining 
agents in four German wines. The wines were dosed with isinglass at 10-50 mg/L and other 
fining agents at five times their normal dosage levels. ELISA assays were used as the 
analytical method and detected no isinglass or fish gelatine in wine, except lysozyme and 
dried egg white, which are soluble in wine. It demonstrated that fining agents used for wine 
are removed during the manufacturing process or those that are insoluble are removed by 
filtration (Weber et al., 2007).   
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Isinglass derived from fish swim bladders used as a clarifying agent in the brewing and wine 
industry may contain parvalbumin. The level of parvalbumin in the isinglass can be 
minimised by following a GMP that is specifically designed for this purpose. 
 
Residual isinglass has been shown to be removed by the filtration/settling process in wine, in 
beer that is filtered; and in cask conditioned beer (that is unfiltered) if sufficient 
sedimentation time is received. It is very likely that parvalbumin with its pI at around 3.9-5.5, 
could precipitate out in wine and beer, which also has pH around 4 and lower. The 
precipitated parvalbumin would then settle with the sediment with isinglass-protein 
complexes or be filtered out by the filtration processes.

COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2007/68/EC
of 27 November 2007
amending Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as
regards certain food ingredients
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the
approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to
the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (
1), and
in particular third subparagraph of Article 6(11) and Article 21
thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC establishes a list of
food ingredients which must be indicated on the label of
foodstuffs as they are likely to cause adverse reactions in
susceptible individuals.
(2) Directive 2000/13/EC provides for the possibility of
excluding from the labelling requirement ingredients or
substances derived from ingredients listed in Annex IIIa
for which it has been scientifically established that they
are not likely, under specific circumstances, to trigger
adverse reactions.
(3) Commission Directive 2005/26/EC (2) establishes the list
of food ingredients or substances provisionally excluded
from the labelling requirement until the 25 November
2007.
(4) A number of applications for permanent exemption from
the labelling requirement have been submitted to the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Those appli-
cations concern substances for which provisional
exemptions were granted by Directive 2005/26/EC. On
the basis of the EFSA opinions and other available infor-
mation, it can be concluded that certain ingredients or
substances derived from those ingredients listed in Annex
IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC are not likely, under specific
circumstances, to cause adverse reactions in susceptible
individuals.
(5) Those ingredients or substances derived from those
ingredients should therefore be permanently excluded
from Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC.
(6) Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended
accordingly.
(7) Directive 2005/26/EC should be repealed on
26 November 2007 in view of the deadline set by
Article 6(11), second subparagraph of Directive
2000/13/EC.
(8) In order to avoid disruption of the market, it is necessary
for this Directive to apply from the 26 November 2007.
(9) It was expected that this Directive could be adopted and
published well in advance of the date of 26 November
2007 in order to give time to the industry to adapt to
the new rules. Since this has not been possible in
practice, temporary measures appear therefore necessary
to facilitate the application of the new rules. Indeed
changes in labelling rules will affect industry, mainly
small and medium enterprises, which need an adaptation
period to smooth the transition towards new labelling
requirements.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in
accordance with the opinion of the Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies 
on a request from the Commission related to a notification from Brewers of 
Europe and BFBi on isinglass used as a clarifying agent in brewing  
pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 11 of Directive 2000/13/EC  - for permanent 
exemption from labelling 
 
 
(Request Nº EFSA-Q-2006-312) 
 
(Adopted on 6 July 2007) 
 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Beer production normally incl udes fining of the beer. Fining  is achieved by mixing fining 
agents with the beer duri ng production, thereafter comple xed materials are removed by 
sedimentation, filtration, or both. Commonly used fining agents include a collagen preparation 
from fish swim bladders, isinglass. Fish alle rgy has been reported to affect 0.2%-2.2% of the 
population in European countries. Fi sh can cause severe reactions in allergic individuals and it 
is appropriate to assess allergen levels in beer clarified with isinglass. 
                                                                                                                                                                              
Allergens of concern in isinglass are primaril y residual amounts of the major fish allergen 
parvalbumin, and collagen/gelatine which constitu te the major component (95%) of isinglass. 
An industry-agreed Code of Good Manufactur ing Practice (GMP) for isinglass has been 
adopted by the applicant to lower the content of parvalbumin in the product. This substantially 
reduced the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass. A history of safe use is claimed. However, there 
may have been a significant under-reporting of react ions against isinglass in beer, because it is 
uncertain whether beer drinkers and health pr ofessionals have been aware of the possible 
presence of fish protein in beer. Analytical data indicate a re sidue level of isinglass in beer up 
to 5 mg/L. Parvalbumin levels in isinglass ranged from 0.2 mg/Kg to 0.7 mg/Kg. The estimated 
maximum concentration of parvalbumin in beer is 0.005 μg/L. However, there is considerable 
uncertainty about the accuracy of the assa ys. Two new double-blind placebo-controlled food 
challenge studies with isingla ss are reported, in which none of  21 fish allergic patients 
experienced any adverse effects.  
 
On the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals 
under the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant.

BACKGROUND  
 
In November 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted  Directive 2003/89/EC 1 
amending Directive 2000/13/EC, as regards indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. 
  
Annex IIIa of the Directive specif ies a list of food ingredients or substances that are known to 
trigger allergic reactions or intolerances in sensitive individuals for which no labelling 
exemptions are allowed. Whenever the listed ingr edients/substances or their derivatives are 
used in the production of foodstuffs, they must be labelled. 
 
Article 1, paragraph 11, subparagraph 2 of the Di rective establishes a procedure allowing for 
temporary labelling exemption of derivatives fr om ingredients listed in Annex IIIa for which it 
has been scientifically established that it is not  possible for them to cause adverse reactions. In 
accordance with this provision, submissions of re quest for temporary labelling exemption were 
notified to the Commission before 25 August 2004. The Commission, after consultation with 
the European Food Safety Authorit y, adopted a list (Directive 2005/26/EC
2) of those 
ingredients which are temporarily excluded fr om Annex IIIa until 25 November 2007, pending 
the final results of the notified studies.  
 
Consequently, applicants who submitted a dossier in 2004 on the basis of subparagraph 2, 
resulting in the inclusion of a product in the list of Direc tive 2005/26/EC, and who are seeking 
exclusion of that product from Annex IIIa beyond 25 November 2007, will have to submit a 
request enclosing the final results of the notified scientific studies. Therefore in the context of 
the permanent labelling exemption procedure, th e European Food Safety Authority is asked to 
provide scientific opinions on the submissi ons in accordance with the present terms of 
reference. 
 
 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
In accordance with Article 29 (1) (a) of Regulation (EC) N° 178/2002, the European 
Commission requests the European  Food Safety Authority to evaluate the scientific data 
submitted by the Brewers of Europe and BFBi (Brewing Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers 
Association) in the framework of the procedur e laid down for temporary labelling exemptions 
in Article 6, paragraph 11 of Di rective 2000/13/EC. On the basis of that evaluation, EFSA is 
requested to issue an opinion on the informati on provided, and particul arly to consider the 
likelihood of adverse reactions triggered in susc eptible individuals by th e consumption of the 
following ingredients/substances used under the conditions specified by the applicant: isinglass. 
 
 
ASSESSMENT  
 
The magnitude of the adult fish-allergic popul ation is uncertain. A Danish population-based 
study with double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) verification of allergy

indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. OJ L 308. 25.11.2003, p. 15. 
2 Commission Directive 2005/26/EC of 21 March 2005 establishing a list of food ingredients or substances 
provisionally excluded from Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.

(Osterballe et al., 2005), found 0.2% of the adult population to  be allergic to codfish. The total 
number of fish-allergic individuals may be somewhat higher, because some fish-allergic 
individuals do not react to codfish. A population-based Amer ican study (telephone survey) 
(Sicherer et al., 2004) gave numbers in the same range , whereas in a European questionnaire-
based study (Woods et al., 2001) 2.2% reported (self-perceived) fish allergy or intolerance. 
 
Taking into account the numerous and well documented reports of allergic individuals reacting 
to fish (NDA, 2004a), it is appropriate for the Panel to assess th e likelihood of adverse 
reactions in allerg ic individuals consuming products wher e the fish-derived product isinglass 
has been used during the manufacturing process. 
 
A dossier submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers Association (BFBi) 
and The Brewers of Europe to the European Commission pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 11 of 
Directive 2000/13/EC as amended by Dire ctive 2000/89/EC on 13 May 2004 for temporary 
exemption from labelling was the basis for an earlier assessment of isinglass by the NDA panel 
(NDA, 2004b).  
 
The present opinion is based on an updated dossi er from the same organization, with an 
application for permanent exemption from labe lling. The updated dossier  contains additional 
information and data mainly with regard to  improvement of the manufacturing process, 
analytical studies on isinglass in beer and on the amount of parvalbumin in isinglass, and 
clinical studies of allergenicity. 
 
1. Manufacturing process  
 
Isinglass is a form of collagen derived from  dried swim bladders of  certain tropical and 
subtropical fish. The production process vari es, according to the applicant, between 
manufacturers. It consists of blending of swim bladders from di fferent fish to meet quality, 
functionality, cost and supply criteria. Then various step s follow including granulation, 
washing, sterilisation with dilute hydrogen peroxide and further washing.  
 
Isinglass powder, paste and “ready-to-use” liqui ds are tested empirically for functionality 
(clarification efficiency) by the isinglass indust ry to ensure consiste nt performance of the 
product. The customers purchase according to certain specifications, including hygienic 
(bacteria, heavy metals) and functionality (pro tein) parameters. The Panel notes that the 
traditional manufacturing process does not have a high level of standardization, which may 
affect possible residual levels of the majo r fish allergen, parvalbumin. However, in 
consideration of results from an alytical studies (see below), an  industry-agreed Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice (G MP) for isinglass has been adop ted by the applicants. To reduce 
parvalbumin content in isinglass, this GMP C ode includes an additiona l washing stage using 
phosphate buffer, the introduction of a sieving step in the granulation stage to ensure that swim 
bladder wall particle size does not exceed 25 mm , and the exclusion of some previously used 
fish species with high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladder. 
 
2. Characterisation of the product and its use  
 
2.1 Characterisation of isinglass  
 
It is stated that the major component of isingl ass (95%) is Type I colla gen together with its 
denaturation product, gelatine (Hickman et al ., 2000; Leach and Barrett, 1967; Moir et al. ,  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 4 of 10 
1984). Isinglass collagen has a molecular wei ght of 800-1300 kDa. Key to the structure, 
functionality and quantification of  isinglass collagen is the presence of hydroxyproline, which 
is rare in other proteins but characteristic of collagen (regar ding its use for quantification of 
isinglass, see below). The profile  of amino acids varies dependi ng on the fish species, and the 
proportion of hydroxyproline reportedly depends on activity and environm ental temperature. 
Isinglass also contains elastin at levels up to 2.5% dry weight . Like collagen, elastin contains 
hydroxyproline.  
 
2.2 Conditions of use  
 
Isinglass is used to remove particles from beer . Isinglass is added to beer in soluble form, 
typically after fermentation an d cooling of the beer, at 15  mg/L (range 10-60 mg/L) for 
brewery-conditioned beers and around 50 mg/L for cask-conditioned beers. Isinglass is 
thereafter removed by sedimentation fo llowed by filtration (sometimes high-speed 
centrifugation can replace filtration). Isinglass redu ces the particle load that goes to the filters, 
and also removes some small particles that would pass through the filters.  
 
Cask-conditioned beer is a traditio nal style of beer in England, in which the yeast remains in 
the cask. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer  before filling or directly into the cask. The 
action of isinglass, it is state d, takes place within the first 3 to 4 hours and results in compact 
sediment at the base of the cask. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the sediment, 
and must be essentially free of suspended part icles. Cask-conditioned beer accounted for 7.5% 
of beer produced in the UK in 2002.  
 
2.3 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer, and exposure levels 
 
2.3.1 Residual amounts of isinglass in beer 
 
Data submitted for temporary exemption (NDA 2004b)  indicated that leve ls of isinglass in 
typical commercial beers ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/L, based on a pr otein precipitation and 
separation method. Another method was based on the separation by affinity chromatography 
using rabbit anti-isinglass antibodies, followed by quantification of isin glass by measuring the 
amount of hydroxyproline using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The method 
employing hydroxyproline as a marker for collagen has been further developed, and the limit of 
detection (LOD) is reported to correspond to 0.17 mg/L on an isinglass dry weight basis. 
 
Results indicate that for many bottle and can beers, residual levels of isinglass are below the 
LOD. The highest concentrations of isinglass detected in these types of beer did not exceed 1 
mg/L. For large containers (kegs and casks), isi nglass concentrations were higher. Residues in 
kegs were generally below 1 mg/L, but occasio nal samples contained up to 3 mg/L. For cask-
conditioned beers, the highest concentrations of isinglass measured did not exceed 5 mg/L. 
Even in cloudy beer, i.e. beer  drawn from just above the se dimented material, in which 
isinglass concentrations were slightly higher th an in the bulk, isinglass concentrations did not 
exceed 5 mg/L. Thus, there was little evidence of a concentration gradient of residues within 
the beer in either casks or kegs. 
 
2.3.2 Exposure levels 
  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 5 of 10 
According to the applicant, annually an estimated 150 million hectolitres of beer worldwide are 
treated with isinglass, approximately 30 milli on hectolitres of that being in Europe. An 
estimated 200 tonnes of isinglass are used annually worldwide to clarify beer. 
 
With 5 mg/L isinglass and a serving of 350 mL clarified beer, the isinglass intake per serving of 
clarified beer would be 1.75 mg. A consumer drinking 1 litre of beer would have an intake of 5 
mg. The Panel notes that  the new analytical methodology has led to the ten-fold increased 
exposure estimate for isinglass over that in the previous application (NDA, 2004b).  
 
Parvalbumin exposure must be calculated from isinglass residue data, because the applicant 
was unable to measure parvalbumin directly in beer (see below). According to the applicant’s 
calculations, the maximum concentration of pa rvalbumin in beer could range from 0.001 μg/L 
(bottle and can beer) to 0.005 μg/L (cask conditioned beer) ba sed on measurement data with 
the new GMP isinglass. With the use of traditio nal commercial isinglass the estimate would be 
about ten-fold higher. Taking measurement un certainties into account and making certain 
assumptions, e.g. that parvalbumin is not eluted from the isinglass into  the beer, the highest 
parvalbumin concentration (new GMP code) derived for cask beer is 0.02 µg/L according to the 
applicant’s estimates. These doses are lower than doses reported to trigger adverse reactions in 
double blind placebo controlled food challenge studies (Taylor et al., 2002), assuming that the 
parvalbumin content of fish muscle is 4000 µg/g or less (Vornanen et al., 1999). However, the 
Panel notes the uncertainties about the accuracy of the measurements and assumptions 
regarding the parvalbumin concentration in beer, as well as the uncertainty with regard to the 
lowest dose of parvalbumin that can trigger an allergic reaction.  
 
3. Evidence of non-allergenicity 
 
3.1 History of non-allergenicity of the product  
 
3.1.1 Literature search strategy  
 
The literature search strategy used to provide historical evidence fo r safety of isinglass used in 
the process of brewing is well de scribed in the application, both in terms of databases searched 
and search terms used.  
 
3.1.2 Historical evidence of safe use  
 
The applicant states that isinglass has been used  as a fining agent for at least two centuries. 
Traditionally, all beer in the UK was fined with isinglass. Addi tionally, isinglass has 
historically been used as an ingredient in f oods and as a setting agent for jellies. Finally, the 
swim bladders themselves are consumed as a food delicacy. In the lit erature search, three 
papers were identified that me ntioned isinglass or fish maws. However, no report s of allergic 
responses to beer, isinglass or fish maws in fish sensitive individuals were found. 
 
The Panel notes that it is uncer tain whether allergy to fish ha s been considered by patients 
experiencing, or by doctors inve stigating, reactions to beer. Mo st people, including medical 
personnel, are likely to be unaware that subs tances derived from fish are used during 
production of beer. Thus, there may have been under-reporting of reactions caused by isinglass 
in beer.

 Page 6 of 10 
The Panel further notes that according to the scien tific literature, adverse reactions in part with 
allergy-like symptoms, do not appear to be infrequent following alcoholic beverage 
consumption. In some surveys of asthmatics,  over 40% have reported the triggering of 
symptoms and 30-35% reported worsening of their asthma. Although wine was the most 
frequently reported trigger of these adverse reactions (Vally and Thompson, 2003), reactions to 
beer also occur often without etiological investigations being undertaken.  
 
3.2 Preclinical studies on allergenicity  
 
Allergic reactions to isinglass as fining agent in  beer could be due to residual amounts of the 
major fish allergen parvalbumin, or the collagen and gelatine th at are major constituents of 
isinglass. 
 
3.2.1 Residual amounts of parvalbumin  
 
The major fish allergen is parvalbumin (NDA , 2004a). The swim bladders of the primitive 
species of fish used for isingl ass production have certain anatomical differences from the swim 
bladders of other fish, and are not generally asso ciated with skeletal muscle tissue. However, 
there is a smooth muscle layer in the swim bl adder wall, and the presence of parvalbumin has 
previously been demonstrated in swim bladders  of fish not used fo r isinglass manufacture 
(Feher et al., 1998; Parmentier et al., 2003).  
 
SDS-PAGE analysis of fish used for isingl ass production showed a band at 12 kDa which is 
characteristic of parvalbumin, whereas a si milar band was not displayed by swim bladder 
extracts. With immunoblotting (polyclonal ra bbit anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum) however, 
traces of parvalbumin were detected in one out of six swim bladder samples.  
 
Homology studies of 18 fish parvalbumins fro m 10 species, based on publicly available 
sequences are reported (NCBI, 200 7). A given fish species cont ains usually 2-5 different 
parvalbumins. Fish species used for isinglass production were not included in the homology 
studies. Two Atlantic and one Baltic cod pa rvalbumins were 63% to 74% identical, and 
parvalbumins from the other fish were from 53% to 92% identical to the three codfish 
parvalbumins. Referring to the literature (Aalberse, 2000), the applicants conclude that high 
levels of sequence identity were observed th at indicate a high likelihood of antibody cross-
reactivity.  
 
ELISA tests based on carp and cod parvalbumins were developed. The anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA was capable of detecting 0.05 µg/mL carp 
parvalbumin in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extract (1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis), 
using the amount of recombinant carp parvalbu min needed to obtain 20% inhibition as the 
detection limit. Strong matrix effects were obs erved when 10% fish gelatine extract was used 
instead of PBS. Comparing different fish speci es, the protein concentration needed to obtain 
50% inhibition was 1.8 µg/mL for carp, 0.4 µg/mL for catfish, 2.8 µg/mL for cod and 10 
µg/mL for tuna, equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin. Fish used for isinglass 
production was not available for testing. The Pane l notes the lack of accuracy of the carp 
parvalbumin-based ELISA, possibly due to species differences, matrix effects or a combination 
thereof. 
 
 
The anti-cod parvalbumin polyclonal antibody-ba sed sandwich ELISA is reported to have a 
limit of detection of 0.20 µg/g cod parvalbumin in PBS. Muscle extracts from the fish species  
 
© European Food Safety Authority, 2007  
 Page 7 of 10 
used for isinglass production did not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, 
although there was evidence for the presence of parvalbumin based on SDS-PAGE and 
immunoblotting with an antibody used in the ELIS A. However, eleven isinglass preparations 
tested gave positive results (see below). The Panel notes that there are uncertainties with regard 
to the accuracy and appropriateness of the cod parvalbumin-based ELISA for the assessment of 
parvalbumin in tropical fish-derived isinglass. 
 
Parvalbumin was detected in single-species isingl ass preparations from a range of fish species, 
obtained from six different supplie rs. Certain fish species appear ed to have more parvalbumin 
than others. Accordingly it was decided that t hose species with high levels of parvalbumin 
which were not otherwise essential in commer cial blends for func tional reasons would no 
longer be used, and a common list of 6 fish speci es was agreed by isinglass manufacturers and 
incorporated into a new GMP code. Further st udies suggested that washing with phosphate 
buffer could reduce residual parvalbumin in isingl ass approximately 4-fold over levels in the 
original raw material, and such washing was also  incorporated into the new GMP code. Levels 
of residual parvalbumin in commercial isinglas s blends on the market (8 products from 3 
manufacturers) were found to be in the range of 1-35 mg/Kg, but  mostly less than 10 mg/Kg. 
Experience with the new GMP code is limited, but isinglass parvalbumin levels are expected by 
the applicant to be less than 1 mg/Kg, and valu es in 9 samples for which data are provided 
ranged from undetectable to 0.7 mg/Kg, most being less than 0.3 mg/Kg (codfish ELISA).  
 
Studies of beer from a 212.700 L tank, as well as theoretical considerations on parvalbumin 
solubility, suggested that parv albumin was significantly concentr ated in the beer sediment, 
rather than partitioning into the bulk of th e beer. In studies on freeze-dried beers employing 
both ELISA assays, with a detection limit of about 9 µg parvalbumin/L of beer, no parvalbumin 
was detected.  
 
3.2.2 Pepsin digestion 
 
The applicant reports pepsin digestion experime nts on isinglass. The Pa nel notes that this 
method is unsuitable for assessing the allergenicity of isinglass. 
 
3.2.3 Allergenicity of collagen and gelatine from fish – IgE binding studies 
 
 
Gelatine is denatured collagen. A number of scientific papers re port that serum IgE from some 
fish allergic individuals binds to fish collagen and gelatine. However, the presence of IgE-
binding to gelatine and collagen does not mean that clinical reactivity is present (see below).   
 
3.3 Clinical studies on allergenicity 
 
3.3.1 Skin testing  
  
Protocols were developed for skin testing with ex tracts of fish muscle and swim bladders from 
a range of species of fish used for commercial isinglass manufacture. Of eight Danish fish 
allergic patients tested, 8/8 reacted to the fish muscle, and 7/8 reacted to the swim bladder. This 
indicates that fish allergic individuals in Wester n Europe have the potential to react to the fish 
species and the starting material from which isi nglass is produced. No skin prick testing with 
commercial isinglass is reported. 
 
3.3.2 Double blind placebo cont rolled food challenge (DBPCFC) studies with isinglass

 Page 8 of 10 
 
According to the applicant, the isinglass us ed for DBPCFC was prepared from a typical 
commercial blend of the agreed six fish species using the new GMP protocols. The 
parvalbumin content, as determined with the ELISA, was 1.0 μg/g carp parvalbumin 
equivalents, and 0.695 μg/g cod parvalbumin equivalents. Inclusion criteria were subjects age 3 
to 70 years in good health, a convincing clinical hi story of a Type I allergic reaction when fish 
was consumed, a positive skin pric k test (as large or larger than  the positive control histamine 
skin prick test) to one or more species of fi sh with a commercial ex tract, and a specific IgE 
score to fish greater than 0.35 kU A/L; both tests had to be perfor med no more than 6 months 
previously. Isinglass was given with mashed pot atoes at cumulative doses of 50.5 mg over two 
hours (0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg ), corresponding to about 10 litres of cask conditioned beer 
or 50 litres of brewery conditioned beer. None of  fifteen patients subjected to this challenge 
protocol in Denmark and Switzerland reacted to the challenges. 
 
In a study in France employing a different protoc ol, a cumulative dose of 20 mg isinglass was 
given corresponding to the e quivalent of four litres of beer. Inclusion criteria  were “allergic 
patients” age 14 to 18 years, but are not further specified in the dossier. None out of six patients 
challenged (2/6 skin test positive to fish) had a reaction.  
 
The Panel notes that the DBPCFC were performed in food matrices in which isinglass is not 
usually consumed. Alcohol is considered to lo wer the dose that may trigger a food allergic 
reaction in susceptible individuals (Sicherer, 2000). 
 
3.3.3 Food challenge studies with fish gelatine  
 
There are no reports of clinical reactions to fish gelatine in relation to food intake, and 
DBPCFC studies have so far been negative, except for one individual reacting to 7.6 g of 
gelatine (NDA, 2004 a and b). Food challenges with gelatine or collagen were not performed in 
the various studies reporting fi sh collagen and gelatine IgE bi nding, except for the two studies 
referred below.  
 
In a DBPCFC study by a Danish group (Hansen et al ., 2004), no adverse reactions were 
observed when 30 codfish allergic patients were  given a cumulative dose of 3.6 g of fish 
gelatine derived from codfish skin. A mild r eaction confirmed in a repeated challenge was 
experienced by one patient when given a cumulative dose of 7.6 g. There was no reaction to the 
next higher dose.  
 
In a French single-blind study (André et al ., 2003) of 100 children and adults with IgE 
reactivity to various species of fish, fish (tuna) skin-derived collagen was used. It was found 
that 3 out of 100 sera showed IgE binding to tuna  skin-derived fish ge latine. A food challenge 
test using 5 g of tuna gelatine was negative in these three subjects.  
 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
On the basis of the data provide d, the Panel considers that it is not very likely that isinglass 
used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic r eaction in susceptible individuals 
under the conditions of production and use specified by the applicant.

Prevalence
 
     Allergy to fish is a common cause of IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. Although 
the exact prevalence of fish-allergic subjects is not firmly established clinically, fish is 
widely accepted as one of the most common allergenic foods (Bousquet et al., 1998).  
Fish allergy is expected to be more common in geographic areas where fish is an 
important dietary component although other factors beyond dietary preferences appear to 
be involved in determination of the sensitization to both food and airborne allergens 
(Gislason et al., 1999).  Because of certain nutritional benefits particularly the levels of 
omega-3 fatty acids, dietary advice often emphasizes the increased consumption of fish.  
The prevalence of adverse reactions to fish is expected to increase worldwide as 
consumers increase their consumption of fish and also because of technological advances 
in fish processing which encourage fish consumption in areas further from the seaside 
(O’Neil and Lehrer, 1995).     
 
     Certainly, fish consumption is reasonably high in the European Union and fish allergy 
is undeniably of considerable clinical importance.  Fish allergy is often identified as one 
of the most common allergenic foods in studies involving pediatric allergy patients 
(Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; Crespo et al., 1992; Sicherer 
et al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  Fish is also an important cause 
of food allergy in adults (Helbling et al., 1999; Hansen and Bindslev-Jensen, 1992; 
Hansen et al., 1997).  In the general population, fish was responsible for about 10% of all 
cases of food anaphylaxis in a case series reported in France by Moneret-Vautrin and 
Kanny (1995).  In an investigation of anaphylaxis episodes in Italy, fish was the most 
common cause of food-related anaphylaxis accounting for 30% of all cases (Novembre et 
al., 1998).      
     A recent survey in the United States indicated that the prevalence of fish allergy in the 
population was 0.4% (Sicherer et al., 2004).  Although this estimate was not confirmed 
by clinical studies, the estimate is probably reasonable given the immediate and often 
clinically noteworthy presentation of allergic reactions to fish.  Sensitization to fish was 
reported in 0.2% of the populations of both Iceland and Sweden (Gislason et al., 1999), 
although challenges were not done in this study either to confirm the existence of fish 
allergy.  The prevalence of sensitization to fish in Sweden had previously been estimated 
at 0.3% (Björnsson et al., 1996).  These prevalence estimates are in reasonable agreement 
with one another suggesting that the true prevalence of fish allergy in the general 
population is likely to be 0.2-0.4%. 
 
Clinical Manifestations
 
     Symptoms of fish allergy are similar to other IgE-mediated food allergies (Lopata and 
Jeebhay, 2001).  Symptoms usually appear immediately (minutes to an hour) following 
exposure and range from mild to life-threatening.  In clinical challenge trials, cutaneous, 
gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms have been provoked by fish (Helbling et al., 
1999; Sicherer et al., 2000). 
 
     Severe, life-threatening allergic reactions have certainly been triggered by fish on 
occasion.  In a study of 60 patients who presented with severe, near-fatal reactions, fish 
were identified as the cause of 13% of the cases (Andre et al., 1994).  In another study of 
14 patients with histories of severe allergic reactions to food, four reactions were caused 
by fish intake (Eigenmann and Calza, 2000).  Several fatalities in the USA have been 
attributed to inadvertent ingestion of fish by fish-allergic individuals (Yunginger et al., 
1988; Bock et al., 2001).  In the U.K., three fatalities are attributed to “seafood” which 
could be fish (Pumphrey, 2000). 
 
Natural History of Fish Allergy
 
     Clearly, fish allergy can have its onset in young children as documented by challenge 
trials in pediatric patients (Dannaeus and Inganas, 1981; Boyano Martinez et al., 1987; 
Crespo et al., 1992; Sicherer et al., 2000; Rance et al., 1996; Rance and Dutau, 2002).  
While young children often become tolerant of certain allergenic foods, such as milk and 
egg, over time, fish allergy is not known to be outgrown. 
 
Clinical Cross-Reactivity
 
     A large number of different fish species have been implicated in allergic reactions to 
fish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Typically, fish-allergic individuals are advised to avoid 
ingestion of all species of fish (Helbling et al., 1999).  The Codex Alimentarius 
Commission has recommended the labeling of fish and products thereof because of the 
notion that fish-allergic individuals are allergic to all species of fish and may also be 
allergic to ingredients derived from fish.  However, while this advice is likely prudent, it 
is not consistent with clinical challenge trials.  In clinical challenge trials conducted in 
 2several clinical centers, fish-allergic patients were sometimes reactive to all fish species 
but on other occasions were able to tolerate certain species while reacting to others 
(Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Helbling et al., 1999).  In many studies, serological 
cross-reactivity among various fish species is widespread (examples see:  Hansen et al., 
1997; Sten et al., 2004; Helbling et al., 1999; De Martino et al., 1993). 
 
Fish Allergens: Parvalbumin as the Major Allergen 
 
     The major allergen in codfish, namely Gad c 1, is a muscle protein that is a member of 
the parvalbumin family (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  The muscles of all fishes contain 
parvalbumins that are homologous, acidic proteins with molecular weights in the range of 
11-12,000 Da that control the flow of Ca2+ in and out of cells.    Gad c 1 is a very stable 
molecule, resistant to extremes in pH, temperature or random folding of the molecule 
when exposed to dissociating agents (Aas and Elsayed, 1975).  All cod-allergic patients 
react to Gad c 1 (Elsayed and Aas, 1971).  Parvalbumin is found as the major allergen in 
both Baltic cod (Gad c 1; Elsayed and Aas, 1971) and Atlantic cod (Gad m 1; Das Dores 
et al., 2002a).  The allergens from other fish species are also parvalbumins including 
salmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel (Tra j 1), several species of tuna including bigeye tuna 
(Thu o 1), bluefin tuna, yellowfina tuna and albacore tuna, three species of mackerel (Sco 
j 1, Sco a 1, Sco s 1), pollack (The c 1), and carp (Cyp c 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 
1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; 
Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999).  Evidence indicates that parvalbumin is present 
in numerous other species of fish even if the protein has not been isolated and 
documented as the major allergen in these species.  Parvalbumin is also the major 
allergen in frog legs and appears to be responsible for cross-reactions between fish and 
frog (Hilger et al., 2004).  Taken together, this research suggests that parvalbumins are 
major pan-allergens in fish and suggests a basis for the cross-reactivity of fish-allergic 
individuals to many, if not all, species of fish.   
 
    Curiously, fish-allergic individuals do not always appear to react on challenge to all 
species of fish.  Although unexplained, several reasons could exist for this lack of clinical 
reactivity.  Some species of fish may have very low levels of parvalbumin.  Chen et al. 
(2006) noted that tuna had low levels of parvalbumin as detectable with an anti-frog 
parvalbumin antibody that was able to detect parvalbumin in other fish species.  
Similarly, fish-allergic patients displayed little or no binding to parvalbumins or proteins 
in that molecular weight range in previous studies with tuna (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 
1998; James et al., 1997; Lim et al., 2005).  Tuna are among the more commonly 
tolerated fish by individuals with fish allergy (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Torres 
Borrego et al., 2003).  Secondly, parvalbumin is now known to have conformational 
epitopes (Untersmayr et al., 2006).  Therefore, slight differences in the three-dimensional 
structure of parvalbumin could affect individual patient reactivity.  Also, heat processing 
in particular could affect these conformational epitopes.  Severe heat processing such as 
the canning of tuna appears to affect allergenicity (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992).  
Finally, the dark muscles of sardine, horse mackerel, yellowtail, Pacific mackerel, and 
red sea bream were found to contain 4-8 times lower levels of parvalbumin than the white 
 3muscles suggesting another basis for individual patient variability (Kobayashi et al., 
2006).  Similar results were obtained in studies of dark and white muscles of longtail tuna 
(Lim et al., 2005). 
 
Fish Allergens – Others
 
     In addition to the major parvalbumin allergen, some evidence exists for the possible 
presence of other minor allergens in various species of fish including codfish (Aas, 1966; 
Aukrust et al., 1978; Dory et al., 1998).  A 41 kDa protein, dissimilar to Gad c 1 with 
respect to molecular weight, isoelectric point, and proportion of hydrophobic amino acids 
was able to bind IgE from some cod-allergic individuals (Das Dores et al,, 2002b; 
Galland et al., 1998).  However, the clinical significance of this minor fish allergen has 
not been established. 
 
    An unidentified IgE-binding protein of 50 kDa was identified in two species of fish, 
hilsa and pomfret, that are popular in India (Das et al., 2005).  Curiously, these fish 
species did not appear to contain parvalbumin or any IgE-binding proteins migrating in 
that molecular weight range.  This immunoblotting study was not confirmed by oral 
challenges to document the clinical reactivity of the patients who provided the blood 
serum. 
 
     Hamada et al. (2001) identified a high molecular weight allergen detected in bigeye 
tuna muscle as collagen.  However the clinical significance of collagen as a fish allergen 
was not confirmed by oral challenge of fish-allergic individuals.  In subsequent studies, 
Hamada et al. (2003b) noted in IgE-binding studies that 10 of 15 fish-allergic patients 
reacted only to parvalbumin from bigeye tuna, while 2 of 15 fish-allergic patients reacted 
only to collagen, 2 of 15 patients reacted to both parvalbumin and collagen, and 1 of 15 
patients reacted to neither protein.  Except for IgE-binding studies, no other evaluations 
were done (challenges, skin tests, etc.) to document further the allergenicity of collagen.  
The sera of the collagen-reactive patients also reacted with collagen from other fish 
species including Japanese eel, alfonsin, mackerel, and skipjack (Hamada et al., 2003b). 
Thus, collagen appears to be a minor fish allergen, although more studies are needed to 
better gauge the prevalence of sensitization to fish collagen.  And, oral challenge studies 
would be useful to confirm the clinical relevance of fish collagen sensitization. 
  
Isinglass 
 
     Isinglass is prepared from the swim bladders, also known as fish maws, of various 
species of tropical fish.  The fish species most commonly used in the preparation of 
isinglass on a worldwide basis include corvina, purse, and several types of sea catfish.  
These are very large fish that also have large maws.  Since these fish are not commonly 
consumed beyond the local tropical areas in which they are caught, the allergenicity of 
these species of fish is not documented.  However, research has now confirmed the 
presence of parvalbumin in these species of fish (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, parvalbumin-
sensitized individuals seem likely to react to ingestion of these fish species although that 
has not been confirmed by oral challenge trials. 
 4 
     Isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines for 
many years.  Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported despite this widespread use. 
 
     Furthermore, fish maws are commonly consumed as food in many parts of the world 
especially in the form of fish maw soup.  Of the more than 3000 metric tons of fish maws 
that are consumed each year, only 240 metric tons are used for the production of isinglass 
for clarification of beers and ales.  The remainder is mostly eaten as fish maw soup.  
Allergic reactions to fish maw soup have also not been reported.  Although consumption 
of this product occurs primarily in countries where clinical allergy is not a common 
medical specialty e.g. China, consumption does also occur among Chinese populations in 
certain EU countries such as the U.K. that have excellent allergy specialization.  Allergic 
reactions to fish maws have also not been reported in any of these EU countries. 
However, research has now confirmed that fish maws from the species of fish used to 
produce isinglass do contain parvalbumin (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, the ingestion of fish 
maws by fish-allergic individuals should be avoided. 
 
     Collagen is the primary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 
kD are described for collagen preparations.  Fish maws are composed primarily of 
collagen.  The processing of the maws is not extensive because the objective is to retain 
the three-dimensional structure of collagen that allows it to entrap proteins and other 
haze-producing substances in alcoholic beverages.  Collagen is very insoluble and 
precipitates quickly upon addition to alcoholic beverages.  Since most of the collagen 
precipitates, extremely low levels of collagen would be expected to remain in the treated 
beverages.   
 
     Since isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major 
allergen from fish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around 
the presence of small amounts parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major 
allergen in several different species of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and 
tuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; 
Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et 
al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 
1999) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals with fish allergy (Taylor et al., 
2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the muscle and swim bladders of the 
fish species used in the manufacturing of isinglass has now been confirmed.  Thus, the 
detection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass seems to be a key factor 
in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material. 
 
     As has now been demonstrated in research funded by the isinglass industry, very low 
but detectable levels of parvalbumin do exist in isinglass as measured by ELISAs using 
both anti-carp parvalbumin and anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  The presence of very 
low levels of parvalbumin in isinglass is not surprising given its presence in the fish 
maws used to obtain the isinglass.  This same research has documented that the 
parvalbumin content of isinglass can be reduced by washing with phosphate buffer.  
Since parvalbumin is a highly soluble protein, this finding is also not surprising.  
 5However, the results documented that parvalbumin could not be eliminated completely 
from isinglass by washing.  The 3-dimensional structure of collagen likely allows it to 
entrap some parvalbumin which is then very difficult to remove. 
 
     The ultimate documentation of the safety of isinglass involves various clinical 
investigations with fish-allergic individuals.  Furthermore, skin testing of fish-allergic 
patients with fish muscle and fish maw extracts from the relevant species of fish 
demonstrated that the muscle and maws of these fish do contain parvalbumin because 
positive skin tests were obtained (FARRP-09-2006).  Thus, these fish contain 
parvalbumin which is capable of provoking allergic reactions in the fish-allergic 
individuals.  A number of double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge tests with 
commercial isinglass have now been completed.  The isinglass used in these clinical trials 
was equivalent to the isinglass samples that was previously shown to contain trace 
quantities of parvalbumin (FARRP-08-2006).  The exposure doses (up to 30 mg for the 
highest individual dose and 50.5 mg cumulative dose) were beyond the levels of isinglass 
exposure from cask ale where exposure would be highest (using worst-case assumptions 
about the amount of residual isinglass, the cumulative challenge dose is equivalent to the 
levels of isinglass found in 50 liters of beer of 10 liters of cask ale consumed over a 2-hr 
time period; thus, even high-level consumers of beer and ale are unlikely to reach this 
level of exposure).  So far, 15 fish-allergic individuals have been challenged with 
isinglass and none have reacted.  Although oral challenges on additional patients are 
planned, the conclusion can already be reached that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit 
allergic reactions in the majority of fish-allergic consumers.  Additionally, under a 
separate clinical protocol, Dr. Fabienne Rance of Toulouse, France challenged 6 fish-
allergic patients with a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass and no adverse reactions 
were noted.  This challenge study, while limited to a small number of patients, adds 
support to the conclusion that ingestion of isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in the 
majority of fish-allergic consumers. 
 
Expert Opinion on Isinglass
 
     In releasing their opinion on isinglass in late 2004, the EFSA panel commented that 
evidence was needed regarding the possible presence of residues of isinglass in treated 
beers and also of the presence of residues of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Furthermore, the 
EFSA panel requested further research to establish whether isinglass may cause allergic 
reactions in fish-allergic individuals.  DBPCFC trials, in our opinion, would be the best 
approach to address this latter question. 
 
     As noted above, the research sponsored by Brewing Food and Beverage Industry  
Suppliers Association (BFBi) and the Brewers of Europe is answering all of these  
questions.  Research has been conducted to develop a suitable assay for parvalbumin  
residues in isinglass.  ELISAs were developed to detect parvalbumin using anti-frog,  
anti-carp, andanti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  All of these ELISAs were able to detect 
parvalbumins.  Trace quantities of parvalbumin were detected in commercial isinglass 
using the anti-cod and anti-carp parvalbumin ELISAs.  The ongoing DBPCFCs with 
isinglass on fish-allergic individuals have demonstrated that exposure to low levels of 
 6parvalbumin through the consumption of treated beers and ales is unlikely to be 
allergenic to fish-allergic consumers.   
 
    Exposure levels to parvalbumin in isinglass used to clarify beers and ales are likely to 
be extraordinarily low.  Based on current application levels of isinglass in beer for its 
clarification function and based upon the new knowledge of residual parvalbumin levels 
in isinglass, an estimated 0.05 μg of parvalbumin is added per liter of beer.  However, a 
prudent assumption would be that the parvalbumin mostly co-sediments with the 
isinglass.  Since maximum isinglass residues are estimated at 5 mg per liter in unfiltered 
ales (cask ale), a reasonable estimate of the level of parvalbumin in ale would be only 
0.0065 μg per liter.  The dosages of isinglass in the ongoing clinical challenge trial are 
0.5, 5.0, 15, and 30 mg which is equivalent to exposure of up to 50 liters of beer (and 10 
liters of cask ale).  This dosage range covers all reasonable levels of exposure to beer and 
should document whether isinglass ingestion presents any risk to fish-allergic consumers. 
 
    One remaining concern would relate to fish collagen as a fish allergen.  Evidence 
indicates that sensitization to fish collagen occurs in only a small percentage of fish-
allergic individuals (4 of 15 in fish-allergic patients studied in Japan).  Oral challenge 
trials have not been conducted to confirm that allergenicity of fish collagen in fish-
allergic individuals.  Furthermore, the fish collagen used in the Japanese studies may 
differ from isinglass and no evidence exists to indicate that the fish collagen-sensitized 
individuals would react to isinglass.  In our opinion, fish collagen is likely a minor fish 
allergen but it is likely a very minor allergen based on the lack of reactivity in the fish 
gelatin trials (Hansen et al., 2004).  Individuals with fish collagen sensitivity may be at 
some risk of ingestion of isinglass but that risk remains unproven especially at low 
challenge doses. 
  
     Although isinglass is an ingredient derived from a commonly allergenic food (fish) 
and despite the fact that isinglass contains protein derived from that source (in fact 
isinglass IS protein from fish), the oral challenge trials and other key evidence obtained 
in recent industry-sponsored studies indicates rather clearly that ingestion of isinglass 
does not present a risk to fish-allergic individuals.  This information is pivotal to any 
determination of need for source labeling of isinglass when it is used in clarification of 
beers and ales.

CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE

I undersigned, Dr Fabienne Rancé, that I have carried out a
clinical study on the allergenicity of isinglass according to a protocol in
the children hospital of Toulouse. The protocol was approved by the
Consultative Committee for Human Protection in Biomedical Research
(CPPRB) at Toulouse I on 17th March 2003.

This was a double-blind study using internationally recognised
standard tests. Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the
study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge was
performed. For each patient the test was performed twice: once
containing isinglass and once containing the placebo. The order of
administration of the tests was determined at random. The test
containing the substance was prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of
isinglass with 10 grammes of cooked potato.

Six patients with fish allergy, aged 6 to 22 years participated in
the study. Fish allergy was determined by oral food challenge or by a
convincing clinical history at the time of the study.

Size of skin prick test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE
specific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs,
cumulative reactogenic dose in mg) for fish and isinglass was
determined.

For this 6 fish allergic patients, we obtained 2 positive skin prick
test with isinglass, and 6 negative double-blind, placebo-controlled food
challenges with isinglass.

The study take its course in Toulouse to prospectively obtain 35
allergic patients and 5 non-allergic.

I. State of Scientific Knowledge  
 
The frequency of fish allergy is regarded differently according to geographical location and 
food habits. In France, fish allergy corresponds to the 5th food allergy in children, and the 
14th food allergy in adults [1, 2]. 
 
Fish Allergy 
Fish form a very wide group with over 20,000 species. The first publication of fish allergy is 
attributed to Besche in Norway [3]. The in vitro work by Tuft [4] and Aas [5], analysing 
several species of fish, notes that fish allergies apply to all species due to cross reactivity 
between them. However certain fish allergies trigger allergic reactions only for a particular 
species. Fish allergy can therefore be isolated to a single species or include all fish:  it 
appears that 40% of patients tolerate at least one fish species [6, 7]. There is no cross 
reactivity between fish and crustaceans or molluscs. 
 
Allergens are agents capable of provoking pathological reactions in an individual sensitive to 
this allergen [8]. Allergens are proteins of molecular weight between 10 and 70 kDa [9]. Fish 
allergens belong to the family of parvalbumines, muscular proteins. The different 
parvalbumines are present in the sarcoplasma of fish muscular cells. The major allergen in 
cod was identified by Aas and Elsayed in 1971, then named according to international 
nomenclature Gad c 1 (Gadus callarias)  [10]. This is the M allergen of cod, a muscular 
protein (sarcoplasma of muscular cells) with MW 12.3 kDa, a family of parvalbumines 
bonding calcium [11]. It is resistant to denaturation and proteolysis. This is an important 
allergen for cod but is not present in all fish species. There are homologies of structure of the 
order of 34% between fish species. Cod also has other allergens, known as intermediary or 
minor, of which one with a molecular weight of 63 kDa is also found in surimi [12]. Recent 
works have also isolated the major allergen of Atlantic salmon Sal s 1 (Salmo salar) , 
muscular extract, parvalbumine family [13]. Cooking or smoking reduces the allergenicity. 
 
Fish Derivatives in the Drinks Industry 
The swim bladders of tropical species such as Aridae, Siluridae, Sciaenidae and 
Polynemidae are used for the preparation of a glue or isinglass. This technological aid is 
used essentially to clarify beer but also wines. It is a collagen of molecular weight 800 to 
 11300 kDa. The swim bladder undergoes several processes: drying, granulation, cleaning 
(physical and cold water) and solubilisation. 
 
In beer, as in wine, isinglass is used at the rate of 1 to 2 grammes per hl. After 
sedimentation, centrifuging and filtration, the highest value found in the end product for 
consumption is 0.16 ppm. These derivatives are t herefore difficult to implicate in allergies 
because of the non-muscular origin in fish, the very high molecular weight far greater than 
for listed allergens, and above all their presence at infinitesimally small levels. Despite the 
traditional use dating from the 18th century, to our knowledge there is no information in the 
literature mentioning an observation of allergy linked to this product. 
 
 
 
II. Purpose of the Study  
 
No work has studied the allergenicity of isinglass, used as a technological aid to clarify beers 
and wines. The allergenicity of isinglass has never been shown, although the allergic risk is 
low. At present we have supposition only. 
 
The main objective is to specify the allergenicity of fish-derived isinglass present in drinks by 
standardised double-blind allergy tests, by comparing the results obtained in patients allergic 
to fish and controls. 
 
 
 
III. Study Protocol  
 
This is a double-blind study using internationally recognised standard tests. 
 
Informed consent is obtained before inclusion in the study. A pregnancy test will be 
performed in girls and young women of child-bearing age. 
 
All patients will undergo the prick test for isinglass, placebo, different fish species, and 
positive and negative controls. 
 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral isinglass challenge will be performed. For each 
patient the test is performed twice:  once containing isinglass and once containing the 
placebo. The order of administration of the tests is determined at random. The test 
containing the substance is prepared by mixing 20 milligrammes of isinglass with 10 
grammes of cooked potato. This quantity has been selected to comply with the extreme 
conditions from the following hypotheses: 
 
* the maximum dose of use of isinglass in beer or wine is 2 g/hl, or 20 ppm 
* the maximum residual doses of the technological aid, isinglass, found in filtered beer is 
less than 0.16 ppm or 0.16 mg/l. As a precautionary measure, it is considered that these 
doses could be 20 times larger, or 3.2 mg/l 
* the quantity of beer ingested is considered as being excessive, 4 litres 
 
The placebo test contains only 10 g cooked potato. The mixture is given in 3 doses of 1, 3 
and 6 grammes at 30 minute intervals. The second test (substance or placebo depending on 
random allocation) is performed 2 hours after the end of the first test. A clinical examination 
with measurement is performed before the food challenge. The test is stopped as soon as a 
clinical sign appears. The patient fasts during the test with permission to drink water or apple 
juice. A meal is served 30 minutes after the end of the test. In the case of a reaction, food is 
served earlier to delay the absorption or dilute the allergen. A doctor and a nurse watch and 
 2report all symptoms. The monitoring covers the skin condition and searches for digestive 
and respiratory signs. Emergency treatment in the case of reaction is prepared before the 
start of the test and available during the test. A doctor with experience in allergies is present 
throughout the test. 
 
Number of patients 
40 patients aged 14 to 18 participate in the study (35 allergic to fish and 5 not allergic). It is 
necessary to obtain 35 consecutive allergic patients to establish that, in the absence of 
positive tests in the allergic patients, it can be concluded with a confidence interval of 95% 
and an α  risk of 5% that isinglass is non-allergenic for at least 90% of patients with fish 
allergy. The same tests with isinglass performed in just 5 patients not allergic to fish allows 
us to establish the absence of allergy to isinglass also in persons not allergic to fish. 
 
Choice of adolescent or young adult volunteers 
Recruitment is not possible amongst adults for successful performance of this study. The 
food allergy is three times more common in children than in adults. The study is easier to 
perform in young persons aged 14 to 18 years. The study cannot therefore be performed in 
any other way. 
 
Methods of recruitment 
Volunteers will be recruited by Dr. Rancé at the Children's Hospital, CHU Toulouse, on the 
basis of 2 groups:  one allergic group and one non-allergic group. The study is carried out 
prospectively to obtain 35 allergic patients and 5 non-allergic. Patients will be selected in the 
same location and time period (consecutive recruitment). 
 
Data analysis 
The data will be analysed at the Children's Hospital in Toulouse. It concerns the following 
indicators:  signs of fish allergy, size of cutaneous test with fish and isinglass, value of IgE 
specific to fish, and result of provocation test by the oral route (signs, cumulative reactogenic 
dose in mg) for fish and isinglass. 
 
The statistical tests used are chi2 for qualitative variables, Student test for mean 
comparison, calculation of association force with OR and precision measurement with IC at 
95%. 
 
Civil liability insurance will be concluded by the sponsor, the company Lallemand.

A.  Introduction: 
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kilo Daltons (kD) are described for 
collagen preparations.  Parvalbumin, a comparatively small protein from fish muscle, is widely 
considered as the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004a).  Fish collagen is not 
considered as a major fish allergen.  Although swim bladders are composed primarily of 
collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  However, 
the presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly investigated and 
certainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Although parvalbumin is 
thought to be a ubiquitous protein in the muscles of all fish species, the presence of parvalbumin 
in the muscles of the fish species used in the preparation of isinglass has not been clearly 
demonstrated.  Furthermore, the allergenicity of these particular species of fish is also not well 
known even though another common assumption is that all species of fish are allergenic.  
Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-
sensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  
This observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
Skin testing was performed with extracts of fish muscle and swim bladders of the fish species 
used in the commercial manufacturing of isinglass.  The primary purpose of skin testing was to 
confirm the likely presence of parvalbumin in the muscle tissues of these unique species and to 
document the presence of parvalbumin in the swim bladders of these species.  This clinical 
investigation will serve to demonstrate that these fish and their swim bladders are likely to 
provoke allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals.

Whole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers 
used by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1.1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 
whole fish).  The whole fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-
like tissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was 
discarded.  In this report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1.1) and 
the description maw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.

All maw samples arrived in dried condition.  The processing background of these samples was 
unknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and 
covered with mold rendering this particular sample unusable.  Samples of maw and fish (after 
fillets were prepared) were stored until use at -20° C. 
 
Extraction buffer 
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to prepare extracts (see FARRP 08-2006 for details of 
optimization of extraction buffer).  PBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue 
number N400500) and contained per liter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na
2HPO4·2H2O and 0.3 g 
NaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  PBS was sterile and pyrogen free solution.  Containers with 
extraction buffer were only used once after opening.  
 
General extraction procedure 
Fish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a 
professional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-
mix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared 
by stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of PBS for 2 hours at room 
temperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4°C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml PP-
test tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 7 of 15 
  
Extracts were filtered over 0.22 μm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES 
[polyethersulfone] sterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic [Corning Inc., 
Acton, MA, USA]). After filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml 
polypropylene cryo vials, 12.5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner 
Bio-one catalogue number 121263).  Filtration and subdividing were done in a flow chamber.  
The extracts were aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at -80°C until distributed to 
the clinical test sites.  One vial of each extract was prepared for each subject.  The materials were 
distributed frozen and subsequently held frozen.  Once thawed for use, the material was used for 
only one subject on one day and then discarded.   
 
Protein concentration determination
Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using Bradford reagent from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, catalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as 
a standard (Sigma: A7906, minimum BSA content: 98%). 
 
Histamine analysis 
Histamine was measured with a Ridascreen Histamin kit (R1604, r-Biopharm, Darmstadt, 
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. All samples were measured once, in 
various dilutions. This assay is a competitive ELISA for the quantification of histamine in food 
 
pH determination 
In order to avoid cross contact between extracts, pH was determined using pH paper instead of a 
pH electrode (pH-Fix 0-14, Machery-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany, catalogue number 921 10) 
with an estimated accuracy of 0.5 pH unit. 
 
Microbiological testing
Skin test extracts were checked for sterility by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Food 
Processing Center Microbiological Services Laboratory. 
 
Parvalbumin concentration
Parvalbumin levels were determined by the ELISA method using anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibody as described in FARRP-07-2006.  The results are expressed in carp 
parvalbumin equivalents. 
 
  C.  Methods: 
 
Subject Selection
Fifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Thus far, 8 fish-allergic subjects have 
completed the skin testing challenge.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were:

2. Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish with a either commercial or 
fresh fish extract AND positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
a).  Recently performed skin prick tests as large or larger than the positive control 
histamine skin prick test or at least 3 mm in diameter. 
b).  Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. 
 
Since certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of the skin test 
responses, conventional antihistamines were discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing, long 
acting antihistamines were discontinued for at least 7 days prior to skin testing, and topical 
steroids were discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.  
Tricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin were withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing. 
Topical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and were avoided at skin test sites.  
 
Skin testing procedure
 
Skin prick testing was done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the cleansed 
volar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a 
sterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same 
fashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution 
(1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify subjects for this study were either 
fresh cod extracts or commercial products expressly prepared for diagnostic skin testing.  The 
commercial extract was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.   Experimental 
skin test materials were prepared by the procedures described above. 
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts were judged and recorded based on the size of the wheal (raised 
welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as compared to the positive and 
negative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-inspected at 30 minutes.   The SPT is 
deemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests and needed 
to be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT or at least 3 mm in diameter to be 
considered positive.   
 
Ethics board approvals were obtained from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and from the 
participating clinical centers. 
 
D.  Results: 
 
Protein and parvalbumin content
The skin test extracts from fish muscle and swim bladders (maws) had somewhat lower protein 
levels than reported previously in FARRP-08-2006 probably because of the ultrafiltration for 
sterilization.  The protein and parvalbumin levels are shown in Table 1.2.

Skin Tests with Fish-Allergic Individuals
Skin testing as described above has been completed on 8 fish-allergic subjects at the clinic in 
Odense, Denmark.  As noted, skin testing of 7 additional individuals is planned in Denmark and 
England but those results are not yet available. 
 
All eight fish-allergic subjects had positive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish fillet 
muscles of each of the fish noted in Table 1.2.  Seven of the eight fish-allergic subjects had 
positive skin test responses to the extracts of the fish swim bladders (maws) of each of the fish 
noted in Table 1.2.  The eighth subject had positive skin test reactions to 5 of the 6 swim bladder 
extracts but had a negative response to a prick test with the extract of swim bladder of  FA 13/05 
(Bagrus pseudopimelodus sp.). 
 
E. Discussion 
 
These results indicate rather clearly that the fish muscle of these tropical fish species contain 
parvalbumin and that the parvalbumin is cross-reactive with IgE antibodies in European subjects 
sensitized to fish eaten more commonly in Europe.  This result is not particularly surprising 
because parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen (Taylor et al., 2004a) that should be found 
in the edible muscle tissues of all fish species.  However, while the levels of protein in the fish 
muscle extracts were reasonably consistent from species to species, the levels of apparent 
parvalbumin were quite variable.  In earlier reports, three different ELISAs for parvalbumin 
were developed and shown to have differing specificities for parvalbumin from various species 
of fish.  Thus, this result should be attributed, at least in part, to possible specificity issues arising 
from use of the monoclonal anti-carp parvalbumin antibody in this particular ELISA.  While the 
allergenicity of the muscle tissue of these species of fish has not been confirmed by oral Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 10 of 15 
  
challenge tests, the presence of parvalbumin in these tissues strongly suggests that fish-allergic 
individuals should avoid consumption of the muscle tissue of these fish. 
 
The extracts of the swim bladders had considerably lower protein levels by comparison to the 
muscle extracts (Table 1.2).  Certainly, this is due to the insoluble nature of the collagen, the 
predominant protein in swim bladders which is thus unlikely to be present in large amounts in 
the saline extracts.  Parvalbumin levels in the extracts of the swim bladders are lower (in 5 of 6 
cases) than parvalbumin levels in muscle extracts.  However, this investigation confirms that the 
swim bladders of these 6 species of fish contain parvalbumin.  While the swim bladder of the 
oyster toadfish has previously been known to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), the 
ubiquity of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders of various species had not been thoroughly 
investigated.  These results demonstrate that parvalbumin is present in swim bladders from all of 
these species so perhaps parvalbumin is ubiquitously present in fish swim bladders.    
 
The swim bladder extract of the black sea catfish contained higher levels of apparent 
parvalbumin than did the muscle extract of that species.  However, that result could also be a 
function of the comparative specificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody.  The parvalbumin 
types in swim bladder and muscle could be different leading to variable recognition by the 
various antibodies to parvalbumin.  It would be interesting to repeat this result with the anti-frog 
and anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies but we have not yet done that experiment. 
 
Since fish swim bladders also contain parvalbumin, the ingestion of fish maws is likely 
hazardous for fish-allergic individuals.  Fish maw soup is consumed in several countries 
including China.  Again, oral challenge trials would be necessary to confirm the hazards 
associated with fish maws but caution would certainly be prudent based upon the existing 
results. 
 
Since the muscle tissue and maws of these fish species used to manufacture isinglass contain 
parvalbumin, the allergenicity of isinglass is likely related to residual levels of parvalbumin in 
commercial isinglass.  As previously noted (see FARRP-08-2006), very low levels of residual 
parvalbumin were found in isinglass.  The following section will describe the results of clinical 
oral challenge trials with isinglass on fish-allergic individuals which will determine the 
allergenic hazard, if any, associated with ingestion of isinglass by such individuals.

  A.  Introduction:  
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for collagen 
preparations.  Parvalbumin, a comparatively small protein from fish muscle, is widely 
considered as the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004a).  Fish collagen is not 
considered as a major fish allergen.  Although swim bladders are composed primarily of 
collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).  
Sensitization to isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-
sensitized individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  
This observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
   
A clinical challenge trial was needed to confirm this suspicion that ingestion of typical quantities 
of isinglass does not pose a hazard to fish-allergic individuals.  In this section of the report, the 
results of oral challenges of 15 fish-allergic individuals are presented.  
 
B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Subject Selection
Twenty-nine fish-allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based on the guidelines put 
forth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the threshold doses for allergenic foods:  
how much is too much?” (Taylor et al., 2004b).   Thus far, 15 subjects have completed the oral 
challenge trials.  Criteria for inclusion in the study were: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects were well characterized fish-allergic children and adults 
in generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  Subjects with 
severe reactions to fish were not excluded. 
 
2.   Positive skin prick test to one or more species of fish AND positive specific 
IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
a).  Recently performed skin prick test as large or larger than the positive 
control histamine skin prick test, or at least 3 mm in diameter. 
b). Recently performed specific IgE score to fish of greater than 0.35 kUA/L. 
 
The subjects enrolled in this challenge trial ceased taking all prescribed medications related to 
their allergies for suitable withdrawal periods before commencement of the challenge trial.  In 
particular, H
1 anti-histamines with a short duration of activity were withheld for a minimum of 
48 hours.  Hydroxyzine was withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 12 of 15 
  
antagonists were withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti-histamines (cetirizine) 
were withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of patients with co-existing or food-induced 
asthma, short-acting inhaled or oral beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics were continued up 
to 6 hours before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists were stopped 12 hours before challenge.  
Chromones (cromolyn and nedocromil) were withheld for 48 hours.  Inhaled steroids or oral 
corticosteroids were continued in patients where prescribed, although patients with serious 
asthma were not included in this challenge.   
 
Caffeine and alcohol were also excluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  Females of child-
bearing age were required to have a negative pregnancy test each day that oral challenges were 
given. 
 
Oral challenge procedure
Oral challenges were performed in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion on two separate 
days (randomly assigned placebo and isinglass challenge days).  The isinglass challenge material 
was a commercially available product supplied by worldwide isinglass manufacturers and 
representative of isinglass as manufactured currently.  This isinglass material has also been 
analyzed for residual parvalbumin (see FARRP-08-2006).  The isinglass was disguised in 
mashed potatoes and the inability to distinguish between potatoes containing isinglass and 
placebo potatoes was confirmed by sensory evaluation.  Subjects were challenged with four 
doses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned mashed potato preparation.  The doses were 0.5 mg, 
5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg isinglass in about 40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing 
amount.  Four portions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass were given on a different day 
and act as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses were given at 30-minute 
intervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo were provided (all in blinded fashion) in the 
event that a dose needed to be repeated.  Doses could be repeated if there was a question about 
the objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction was observed after the duplicate dose, the 
next dose was given. 
 
Dehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge material were pre-weighed into challenge containers 
in a food grade facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Preparation of the challenge 
material at the clinical investigation site required the addition of nearly boiling water to the 
challenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, allowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, 
mixing and then presenting to the subject.  The challenge order was randomized for each subject 
and all challenge materials blinded before shipping to the clinical investigation site.

These subjects also reported on their consumption of alcoholic beverages (Table 2.2).  These 
individuals reported that they regularly consumed beers, ales, and wines without incident.  The 
alcoholic beverages are likely to have been treated with isinglass on at least some occasions.  
This small survey was conducted to document that fish-allergic individuals do not avoid 
isinglass-treated beverages.

None of the 15 individuals challenged thus far has reacted adversely to the isinglass challenge.  
Therefore, consumption of a cumulative dose of 50.5 mg of isinglass or an upper dose of 30 mg 
of isinglass occurred without provocation of any adverse reactions.  One subject had a mild 
adverse reaction (skin rash) to placebo but not to isinglass.  This response was the only objective 
symptom encountered during the oral challenge trials.  Three subjects each experienced mild 
subjective reactions (e.g. palatal itching) to placebo and isinglass at initial doses used in the trial.  
However, these symptoms resolved quickly and further doses of either placebo or isinglass were 
administered without these or other symptoms developing.  Thus, these subjective reactions do 
not appear to be related to the challenge trial.  
 
D.  Discussion: 
 
While our ultimate aim is to enroll 29 fish-allergic patients in the isinglass challenge trial, only 
15 subjects have completed the challenges so far.  However, none of these patients has reacted 
adversely to the administration of a cumulative challenge dose of 50.5 mg of isinglass.  This 
amount of isinglass is far in excess of the amount that might be achieved with beer and wine 
consumption.  Cask ale, under certain circumstances, may allow higher levels of isinglass 
exposure but the 50.5 mg cumulative dose was intended to represent a worst-case scenario that is Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-09-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 15 of 15 
  
even beyond the exposure levels that likely occur with cask ale.  Thus, this challenge trial 
confirms that fish-allergic individuals may safely consume alcoholic beverages that have been 
treated with isinglass.

Determination of the Allergenicity of Isinglass in Fish Allergic Individuals 
 
Isinglass is a product composed principally of collagen derived mainly from the swim 
bladders of certain species of tropical and subtropical fish (corvina, threadfin, croaker, 
and others), although cod, sturgeon and hake swim bladders may also be used 
occasionally (1).   
 
Isinglass is a processing aid used to clarify beers, ales, wines, and champagnes of  
yeasts, proteins, and other macromolecular components used or created during the 
fermentation process (1).  Without use of clarifying agents, these alcoholic beverages 
would be cloudy rather than clear.  Because the collagen molecules are amphoteric, the 
negative charges attract and bind to yeast cells while the positive charges attract and 
bind to proteins.  Furthermore, isinglass is highly insoluble and its addition results in 
immediate clarification of the liquid.  Clarification can be achieved with a rather low level 
of addition of isinglass, typically in the range of 0.001% to 0.002% (2).  In most cases, 
the isinglass and the components that precipitate with it are removed by filtration or 
centrifugation before packaging of the beverage.  In those situations, exposure to 
isinglass in the beverage as consumed would be quite low because the majority of it is 
likely removed.  Residue levels in filtered beer have been measured in the range of 0.02 
– 0.16 parts per million (ppm) or mg/l (2).  Cask ale, a popular beverage in the U.K., is 
an exception where the precipitated mass is left in the bottom of the cask.  In this case, 
isinglass exposure can be higher for consumers of cask ale especially as the cask is 
tipped and some sludge from the bottom of the cask may be intermixed with the ale.  
The levels of residual isinglass in cask ale have not been measured and, as noted, are 
likely to be variable from glass to glass. 
 
Because it is derived from a major allergenic food source, namely fish, the allergenicity 
of isinglass to fish-allergic individuals is a question of interest.  Fish are considered to 
be one of the most commonly allergenic foods in the human diet (1).  Fish and 
ingredients derived from fish are included on lists of commonly allergenic foods in 
countries in which such lists exist including the US, EU., Canada, and Australia/New 
Zealand (1).  Isinglass is certainly an ingredient derived from fish although its 
allergenicity has not been established.  Thus, regulations in these countries and regions 
would require that isinglass be labeled on the alcoholic beverages and that its fish origin 
also be declared unless an exemption could be granted.  Some countries and regions 
including the EU and US provide for the possibility of labeling exemptions in cases 
where the lack of allergenicity of the ingredient can be established. 
 
Fish-allergic individuals are typically advised to avoid ingestion of all species of fish and 
ingredients derived from fish.  While it has been observed clinically that some fish-
allergic individuals are tolerant of certain species of fish, the basis for this tolerance has 
not been elucidated (3).  In other clinical studies, fish-allergic individuals appear to be 
sensitive to all species of fish (4,5).  The major allergen of fish has been identified as 
parvalbumin, a muscle protein (6).  Parvalbumin appears to be a pan-allergen that 
exists in the edible muscle tissue of all fish (7,8).  Parvalbumin has been described to 
 1also occur in the swim bladders of some fish species (9) but the level and allergenicity 
of this parvalbumin has not been determined.  A few reports exist of other higher 
molecular weight protein allergens from fish (7, 10).  Collagen isolated from fish muscle, 
not swim bladder, has been identified as one of these allergens (10).  However, only a 
few Japanese patients have thus far been identified with IgE reactivity to fish collagen 
(7) and its allergenicity by oral challenge has not been documented.  Furthermore, the 
comparative lack of allergenicity of another fish collagen product, fish gelatin made from 
fish skins, in fish-allergic subjects has been documented (11). 
 
Isinglass may contain residual parvalbumin although the level of parvalbumin in 
isinglass has not been determined analytically (this is another research objective that is 
being simultaneously pursued).  Despite centuries of use in wines, ales, and beers, 
allergic reactions to isinglass have not been reported in the clinical literature (1).  The 
objective of this clinical trial is to determine the potential allergenicity of commercially 
produced isinglass in fish-allergic individuals. 
 
Objective:  Determine the allergenicity of isinglass by performing double blind placebo 
controlled food challenges in fish allergic individuals. 
 
Overview:  Twenty-nine fish allergic individuals will be selected and challenged based 
on the guidelines put forth in “A consensus protocol for the determination of the 
threshold doses for allergenic foods:  how much is too much?” (12).   Oral food 
challenges will be performed according to the following protocol by clinical collaborators 
with challenge materials supplied by FARRP.  The amount of isinglass used for the 
challenges will reflect typical exposure amounts. 
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the 
use of human subjects at their specific institutions.  
 
Statistical Design:  The proposed sample size of 29 subjects is based upon the 
assumption that no subjects will react at the lowest challenge dose and assuming that if 
a subject reacts to one dose, then they will also react to higher doses.  If 29 subjects 
are challenged and a dose is identified where 0/29 subjects reacts, then there is 95% 
confidence that 90% of fish-allergic individuals will not react to this amount of isinglass 
or less.  The sample size of 29 is based upon the hypothesis that the reaction rate is 
equal to 10%. 
 
Data analysis plan 
We will attempt to set a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) as well as estimate 
the false positive rate and the proportion of truly sensitive individuals.  Data will be 
captured as reaction / no reaction for each dose of active challenge material. The 
placebo reaction rate will be taken into account as follows:

NA= not administered, assuming that if a subject reacts to one dose, then he or she will 
also react to higher doses, these are scored as + 
 
The number of positive and negative placebo and active reactions will be tallied and 
entered into the formula of Briggs et al. (13) and calculated as outlined in Hansen et al. 
(11) and illustrated below.

The above formula will allow for an estimate of a false positive rate (0.069 in the above 
example) and an estimate of the proportion of truly sensitive individuals (0.037 in the 
above example).   None of the 29 subjects in the above example reacted to the 5 mg 
challenge dose therefore 5 mg would be the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL).  
 
 
 
 
 3Subject Criteria:  Potential subjects must have: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and 
adults in generally good health, between the ages of 3 and 70 years.  
Subjects with severe reactions to fish should be included so that this segment 
of the fish-allergic population is not overlooked. 
  
2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a 
pan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract 
provides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial 
extract AND
 positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
 a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months 
 previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters 
 need to be reported in millimeters and be as  large, or larger than the positive 
 control histamine skin prick test. 
 b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach 
 since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of 
 fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 
 kU
A/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual 
 specific IgE score in kU A/L must be reported. 
 
  3. Subjects enrolled in this challen ge trial should cease taking all prescribed   
   medications related to their allergie s for suitable withdrawal periods before  
   commencement of the challe nge trial.  In particular, H1 anti-histamines with a  
   short duration of activity should be withheld for a minimum of 48 hours.    
   Hydroxyzine is to be withheld for a minimum of 72 hours, leukotriene receptor 
   antagonists should be withheld for up to 1 week, and second generation anti- 
   histamines (cetirizine) should be withheld for at least 1 week.  In the case of  
   patients with co-existin g or food-induced asthma, short-acting inhaled or oral  
   beta-agonists and inhaled anticholinergics could be continued up to 6 hours  
   before challenge.  Long-term beta-agonists should be stopped 12 hours   
   before challenge.  Chromones (cromo lyn and nedocromil) should be withheld  
   for 48 hours.  Inhaled ster oids or oral corticosteroids would be continued in  
   patients where prescri bed, although patients with serious asthma should not  
   be included in this challenge.  If pati ents are taken off of routine medications,  
   the challenge trials must be conducted in a manner that any reactions arising  
   from the withdrawal of medications can be distinguished from true reactions  
   to the food incorporated into the challenge trial.   
 
  4. Caffeine and alcohol should also be ex cluded for 24 hours prior to challenge.  
   Females of child-bearing age must hav e a negative pregnancy test each day  
   that oral challenges are given. 
 
 4Methods and Procedures: 
 
Skin Prick Test (SPT) 
  
Skin prick testing is done by placing a drop of commercially prepared fish extract (from 
any fish species or mixture of fish species as noted above) on the cleansed forearm or 
back of the individual, and lightly pricking the skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  
Negative and positive skin prick test controls are done in the same fashion with saline 
solution or the solution used to prepare the extract and histamine solution, respectively.  
All of the SPT materials are commercial products and are expressly prepared for 
diagnostic skin testing.  
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the 
wheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as 
compared to the positive and negative control skin tests after 15-30 minutes.   A SPT is 
deemed positive by comparison to the negative and positive control skin tests.  A small 
amount of reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account 
when judging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the 
wheal at the site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening.  
The size of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 15 mm or larger 
wheal diameter, with a flare around the wheal that is hardly visible to one that may have 
a diameter of 50 mm or more.  This wheal and flare response to fish should be at least 
as large as the positive histamine control SPT.  Extremely large wheal and flare 
reactions are uncommon when using commercially prepared skin test reagents, but may 
occur on occasion.  The result is recorded by measuring the diameter of the wheal and 
the diameter of the wheal and flare.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should 
be noted (i.e. pseudopodia). 
 
The size of the wheal and flare is not necessarily indicative of the severity of the 
reaction that may be experienced when fish is ingested, or the amount of fish required 
to cause a reaction.    
 
Blood draw (venipuncture) 
 
A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm for RAST testing.  The blood will 
be processed into serum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the 
serum can be submitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific 
IgE to fish requires only a few milliliters of serum. 
 
Oral Challenge Description 
 
Oral challenges will occur in a clinical setting allowing prompt medical treatment if 
necessary during the challenge.  Subjects will be monitored by qualified medical 
personnel.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject will have a severe reaction 
during skin prick testing or oral challenge, a code cart or special emergency supplies 
including intubation equipment and defibrillator will be available and epinephrine and 
 5other medications will be administered according to the level and severity of reaction.  
Clinical Investigators may deem it necessary for some subject to have an intravenous 
line placed for rapid medical treatment.   Standard biophysical measurements will be 
made before each dose: pulse, blood pressure.  If appropriate, some clinical 
investigators may wish to monitor peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), but this is not 
required.   Subjective symptoms should be recorded on the FARRP Isinglass Study 
Challenge Data Sheet, but the challenge should continue until objective symptoms are 
observed, unless the subject cannot tolerate the subjective symptoms.  Investigators 
may wish to consider photographs or digital images to document visible reactions (i.e. 
skin reactions). 
 
Subjects will be challenged with four doses of isinglass in a rehydrated, seasoned 
mashed potato preparation.  The doses will be 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg 
isinglass in 20-40 grams mashed potato given in order of increasing amount.  Four 
portions of mashed potatoes containing no isinglass will be given on a different day and 
act as the placebo portion of the oral challenge.  The doses will be given at 30-minute 
intervals.  Duplicates of each dose and placebo will be provided (all in blinded fashion) 
in the event that a dose needs to be repeated.  Doses should be repeated if there is a 
question about the objectivity of the reaction.  If no objective reaction is observed after 
the duplicate dose, the next dose should be given.  
 
The isinglass challenge material will be a commercially available product supplied by 
The Allied Brewery Trading Association of the U.K which represents most of the 
isinglass manufacturers of the world.  Dehydrated potatoes and isinglass challenge 
material will be pre-weighed into challenge containers in a food grade facility at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln by the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator. 
 
Preparation of the challenge material at the clinical investigation site will require the 
addition of nearly boiling water to the challenge containers, briefly stirring to moisten, 
allowing the mixture to stand for thirty seconds, mixing and then presenting to the 
subject.  Newly purchased Pyrex containers and graduated cylinders will be provided to 
heat and measure the water.  These containers will require cleaning by clinical 
investigator prior to each challenge prepared and used exclusively for this study.  The 
challenge may be served in the same container in which the material is rehydrated. The 
clinical investigator will need a method of heating the water.  A microwave oven works 
well for this as does an electric tea kettle. 
 
Challenge materials will be randomized, blinded and the challenge order randomized 
before shipping to the clinical investigation site. 
 
Benefits  
 
The direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not isinglass is an allergy risk for 
him or her.  Results from all of the subjects will be used to determine labeling policies 
for isinglass-containing products. 
 6  
Risks 
 
Skin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in 
allergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (15-
20). The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito 
bite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a 
few minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. 
 
The drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks 
can occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may 
remain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally 
associated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur 
at the site of the venipuncture.  
 
The subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the 
skin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin 
prick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin 
prick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered 
according to the level and severity of reaction.  
 
The precise risk of anaphylaxis from the food challenge is unknown.  In a recent study 
examining the risks of oral food challenges, 253 oral challenges resulted in reactions 
with foods to which the subject was allergic (21).  Most reactions to all foods in this 
study were classified as mild to moderate with 28% of the reactions categorized as 
severe.  The lowest median dose associated with a severe allergic reaction was 0.6 
grams of milk.  There was a similar risk of severe reactions regardless of the food in the 
challenge.  Overall, all reactions were reversible with short-acting histamine with or 
without epinephrine, β-agonists, and/or corticosteroids.  No subjects required 
hospitalization.  The authors note that there are risks associated with food challenges, 
but these risks are reasonable when challenges are performed under the guidance of 
and experienced practitioner in a properly equipped setting.  Nursing and physician staff 
will be present during the oral food challenge.  In the event that the subject has a 
reaction during the oral food challenge, emergency supplies and medications will be 
available and be administered according to the level and severity of reaction. 
   
Recruiting Procedures 
 
Each clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for their location.  
Suggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, and 
recruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also be 
sent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include examples 
of letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human subjects use 
committee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical investigator’s 
local human subjects use committee. 
 
 7Compensation 
A per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site 
should propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, 
supplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal 
preparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  
Compensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when 
allowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  Clinical investigators may want to recompense the 
subject for completing specific parts of the study: for example, a set amount would be 
given for undergoing skin prick tests or blood draw; an additional amount would be 
given for completing the oral challenge. The compensation amount is to be determined 
by and paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per 
subject cost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  
Instructions for invoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are 
distributed to the clinical investigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without 
receipt of deliverables by FARRP. 
 
Informed Consent Forms 
Each clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to 
conform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use 
committee.   
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
This procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each 
clinical investigator. 
 
Maintaining Confidentiality 
Each clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP 
Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Isinglass Study Challenge 
Data Sheet “will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain subject 
names, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to FARRP.  At the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” 
and the “Isinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” will be stored in a locked file.  Only the 
Clinical Study Coordinator and the Co-Directors of FARRP will have access to this 
information.  In publications or reports using information collected from this work, the 
subjects will either be referred to as a collective or be identified by a subject number or 
other appropriate blinded designation. 
 
Copy of Questionnaire and Datasheets   
Copies of the “FARRP Isinglass Study Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP 
Isinglass Study Challenge Data Sheet” are included for submittal with clinical 
investigators’ proposal to their institute’s human subjects use committee. 
 
Funding  
This project is being funded by the Food Allergy Research & Resource Program at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE USA.  If you require a letter indicating this, 
contact Julie A. Nordlee, FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator.   
 8 
Contract 
Each clinical investigator will be asked to sign a contract with FARRP and the University 
of Nebraska which will detail the deliverables to FARRP, the agreed upon per subject 
cost and details regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement between FARRP 
and the clinical investigator and their institution. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
A two-member board will be established consisting of two allergists with experience in 
double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be reported to the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator by fax, phone and email within 24 
hours.  A standardized form to report these events will be provided to the clinical 
collaborators with the challenge material instructions. The FARRP Clinical Study 
Coordinator will immediately fax or email the SAE report form to the Board.  The Board 
will convene a teleconference within 48 hours to discuss what actions, if any, should be 
taken.  The Board will have 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments 
to the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators.   The Board will 
also be charged with examining, discussing and producing a short report of its findings 
for all adverse event data to be supplied to the Board by the FARRP Clinical Study 
Coordinator.  The Board will convene a teleconference or electronic mail 
correspondence every three months until the completion of the study or when 50% of 
the subjects have completed the challenges, which ever occurs first.  The Board will 
have 7 days to return its written recommendations and comments to the FARRP Clinical 
Study Coordinator and the Clinical Investigators. 
 
1. Each member of the Board will be paid a stipend of $150 per meeting.  
 
2. In the event that the death of a subject occurs during the course of the study, 
the FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator will be contacted immediately and all 
procedures at all clinical study sites will cease until further notice.  Other SAEs 
will be evaluated as indicated above and according to the SAE Report form. 
 
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event or reaction is defined as any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution.  This 
includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: 
 
• Death:  A death occurring during the study must be reported. 
• Life-threatening:  Any adverse therapy ex perience that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Other conditions as specified in the protocol. 
• An event that requires intervention to pr event permanent impairment or damage.  An 
important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
 9hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 
• Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject temporally associated with the 
challenge material, whether or not considered related to the challenge material.   
• An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable or unintended sign or symptom temporally 
associated with the challenge material. 
• These occurrences should be reported on the Challenge Data Sheet.

Determination of Skin Reactivity to Unique Fish Species 
 
1.  DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 
 
Objective:  By means of routine methods used by clinicians in allergy practice, 
determine the potential allergenicity of unique fish species by performing skin prick tests 
in fish allergic individuals. 
 
Background:  Though not specifically confirmed by clinical studies, fish allergic 
individuals are believed to be potentially reactive to all species of fish (1).  Hundreds of 
fish species exist worldwide that are used for human consumption or to make food 
ingredients including fermented fish sauces, isinglass, fish gelatin, fish oil, and collagen. 
Specifically, this research project is part of a larger effort aimed at assessing the 
potential allergenicity of isinglass.  Isinglass is a fish-derived ingredient used in the 
clarification of beers, wine, ales, and champagnes (1).  Isinglass is obtained from the 
swim bladders of certain species of fish, usually large tropical fish, including croaker, 
threadfin, corvina, and others (1).  Isinglass is composed primarily of collagen (2).  
Edible fish muscle contains an allergenic protein called parvalbumin, a calcium-binding 
protein involved in muscle contraction (3).  Parvalbumin is thought to exist in the muscle 
tissues of all fish species and has specifically been found in a large number of fish 
species including cod, salmon, carp, mackerel, tuna, and others (3-8).  Parvalbumin is 
theorized to be the pan-allergen that is responsible for fish allergies and its ubiquity in 
fish muscle is the reason why fish-allergic individuals are believed to react to all fish 
species.  Moreover, parvalbumin is known to exist in the swim bladders of at least one 
fish species [toadfish] (9).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in the unique fish 
species used to make isinglass or in the swim bladders from these fish has not been 
established.  The commercial process for making isinglass likely results in the removal 
of some of the water-soluble parvalbumin.  Skin testing with extracts prepared from the 
flesh and swim bladders of these unique fish will provide additional information to 
support or refute the premise that fish allergic individuals could be potentially reactive to 
all species of fish.  Skin testing would be useful in ascertaining whether parvalbumin is 
present in the swim bladders of these unique species.  
 
Overview:  Fifteen fish allergic individuals will be selected.  The subject selection will be 
based on a history of allergy to fish species commonly consumed such as cod, salmon 
and tuna, etc. and positive skin prick tests to commercial skin test extracts prepared 
from these same types of fish.  The selected subjects will be skin prick tested with 
materials prepared from the flesh and swim bladders of the unique species of fish used 
to make isinglass, that are not commonly ingested in the United States or European 
Union.   
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols and receive approval for the 
use of human subjects at their specific institutions.   Copies of these approvals must be 
provided to FARRP before skin-test materials will be provided.  These approvals will be 
provided to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln IRB when received. 
 12.  METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
 
Procedure Overview:  Qualified subjects will be skin prick tested with 12 extracts 
derived from different unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders as well as a 
positive control solution (1% histamine), and negative control solution [extraction buffer 
containing sodium chloride and phosphates at or near neutral pH (7.0-7.5)].  Time 
required for the subject will be 1.5-3 hours.   
 
Clinical collaborators will be required to submit protocols to the ethics or human 
subjects use committee and receive approval for the use of human subjects at his or her 
specific institutions.  The following clinicians have expressed an interest in participating 
as our collaborators:

FWA00004088 
 
Dr. Richard Pumphrey 
Manchester Royal Infirmary 
Manchester, UNITED KINGDOM 
FWA00006996 
   
 
Specific Methods and Procedures: 
 
Skin prick testing and blood draws are needed to qualify subjects for the study. 
 
Skin Prick Test (SPTs) 
  
Skin prick testing is done by placing a drop of fish extract or control extracts on the 
cleansed volar surface of the forearm or the back of the individual, and lightly pricking 
the skin with a sterile needle or lancet.  Negative and positive skin prick test controls are 
done in the same fashion with saline solution or the solution used to prepare the extract 
and histamine solution (1%), respectively.  Skin prick test materials used to qualify 
subjects for this study should be commercial products and are expressly prepared for 
diagnostic skin testing.  The commercial extract will be used in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions.   Other skin test materials will be provided and prepared in 
the laboratory by the procedures described below. 
 
Skin prick tests for fish extracts will be judged and recorded based on the size of the 
wheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area around wheal) as 
compared to the positive and negative control skin prick tests after 15 minutes and re-
inspected at 30 minutes.   The diameters of wheal and flare reactions will be measured 
in millimeters and recorded for each time point.  A SPT is deemed positive by 
comparison to the negative and positive control skin prick tests.  A small amount of 
 2reddening may occur with the negative control and this is taken into account when 
judging the other SPT results.  A positive SPT is characterized usually by the wheal at 
the site of the prick that is sometimes surrounded by the flare or reddening (14).  The 
size of the reaction is individualistic and may range from 2 mm to 14 mm or larger wheal 
diameter (14), with a flare around the wheal that may range from hardly visible to one 
that may have a diameter of 50 mm or more.  The wheal and flare response to fish 
extracts should be at least as large as the positive histamine control SPT to be 
considered positive.  Any unique or distinguishing characteristics should be noted (i.e. 
pseudopodia). 
 
Blood draw (venipuncture) 
 
A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in the arm.  The blood will be processed into 
serum by the clinical investigator as soon as possible so that the serum can be 
submitted for specific testing against fish proteins.  Testing for specific IgE to fish 
requires only a few milliliters of serum. 
  
Preparation of Non-Commercial Skin Prick Test Materials 
 
Fish extracts of the flesh and swim bladders of six selected unique fish species (see 
following table) will be prepared by PodiCeps BV, Houten The Netherlands.  Extracts 
will be prepared using the most optimal extraction buffer.  At least 100 ml of extract will 
be prepared for each species by the following steps.  Sterility checks of the extracts will 
be performed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Food Science and 
Technology Microbiological Services Laboratory.  Histamine analysis will be performed 
using Neogen Corporation Veratox® Quantitative Histamine Test in the laboratory of Dr. 
Sue Hefle, Food Allergy Research and Resource Program, Department of Food 
Science and Technology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
 
1.  Crude extracts of each unique species of fish flesh and swim bladders will be   
  prepared using extraction buffer containi ng sodium chloride and phosphates at or 
  near neutral pH (7.0-7.5).  One part fi nely chopped or ground fish flesh or swim  
  bladder will be mixed with 10 parts extrac tion buffer and mixed overnight at 4-  
  6°C.  Before the extraction procedur e the swim bladders will be milled to a   
  nominal size of 4 cm and washed in a 2% hydrogen peroxide solution for 30   
  minutes before rinsing and drying. 
2. The crude extract will be clar ified by centrifugation. 
3.  The supernatant material resulting from  the centrifugation will be sterilized by   
  filtration using 0.22 µm  sterile  memb ranes in a laminar flow chamber and    
  packaged aseptically in the chamber. 
4.  The protein content of  the sterilized extract will be determined using the Bradford  
  method (15).  If necessary the extracts  will be diluted using sterile extraction   
  buffer in a laminar flow chamber to a pr otein content within the range reported in  
  commercially available skin pr ick test extracts for fish. 
5.  The resulting material will be aseptically distributed into sterile vials and stored at 
  -80°C until distributed to the clinical test  sites.  One vial of each extract will be  
 3  prepared for each subject.  The materi als will be distributed frozen and     
  subsequently held frozen.  Once thaw ed for use, the material will be     
  used for only one subject on one day and then discarded.   
6.  Histamine content will be determined using immunoassay methods (Neogen   
  Corp, Lansing, MI).  To assure that the unique fish starting materials have not  
  been subjected to spoilage conditions the level of histamine in the non-    
  commercial fish skin prick test extracts must be less than 0.005% (16).  If the   
  level of histamine is greater than or equal to 0.005% new materials will be    
  obtained and the extractions remade. 
7.  Information/fact sheets of each unique fi sh flesh and swim bladder extract will be  
  prepared and shipped to the clinical co llaborators together with the extracts.   
  Facts sheets will contain information on: pr otein content, salt content, pH and   
  histamine content.

3. SUBJECT CRITERIA 
 
Fifteen fish-allergic subjects will be challenged.  Potential subjects must have: 
 
1. Convincing clinical history of a Type I allergic reaction when fish are 
consumed.  Subjects should be well characterized fish-allergic children and 
adults in generally good health.  Potential subjects must be at least three 
years old and not older than 70 years.   
  
2. Positive skin prick test to one or more  species of fish (since fish contain a 
pan-allergen, parvalbumin, a positive skin test to any aqueous fish extract 
provides the needed demonstration of IgE reactivity to fish) with a commercial 
fish extract AND
 positive specific IgE to fish that meet the following criteria: 
 
 a).  If the most recent skin prick testing was perfo rmed more than 6  months 
 previously, a new skin prick test must  be done.  Skin prick test diameters 
 need to be reported in millimeters and be, as large or larger than the positive
 control histamine skin prick test. 
 b). Specific IgE score to fish (b y any specific IgE measurement approach 
 since IgE to one or more species of fish is assumed to support a diagnosis of 
 fish allergy and a need to avoid all s pecies of fish) must be greater than 0.35 
 4 kU A/L and be performed no more than 6 months previously.  The actual 
 specific IgE score in kU A/L and the method used must be reported. 
 
  3. Certain medications may interfere with the development and interpretation of  
   the skin test wheal and flare responses elicited by allergen extracts and   
   histamine positive control. Conv entional antihistamines should be     
   discontinued at least 3 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines  
   should be discontinued for at least 7 da ys prior to skin testing.  Topical    
   steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3     
   weeks before skin testing (10,11).  Tr icyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin  
   should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing (12) Topical local  
   anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided at skin  
   test sites (13). 
 
 
Statistical Design 
The working hypothesis for this project is that the unique fish species used in the 
production of isinglass will be allergenic as documented by positive skin prick tests in 
individuals with well documented allergies to more frequently consumed fish.  If this 
hypothesis is true, then all of the patients will display positive skin prick tests to the 
extracts of the various species of fish used in this study.  Since the subjects selected for 
this study will have allergies to fish and these fish are known to contain parvalbumin as 
their major allergen, this finding will also provide proof that these unique fish species 
contain parvalbumin that is cross-reactive with parvalbumin from the more commonly 
ingested species.  If one or more of the unique fish species in this study contain no 
parvalbumin or low levels of parvalbumin, then some or all subjects may have negative 
skin prick test reactions to those extracts.  Similar determinations will be made for the 
swim bladder extracts from the unique fish species except that it is much less certain 
that the swim bladders will contain sufficient allergen to provoke a positive skin prick 
test reaction.  Statistically, we expect significantly higher numbers of positive skin prick 
test reactions in the subjects to the various unique fish extracts than to the negative 
control skin prick tests.   
 
4.  BENEFITS AND RISKS  
 
Benefits  
 
The direct benefit to the subject is to know whether or not there is a potential for him or 
her to be allergic to these unique species of fish if ingested.  Results from all of the 
subjects will be used to determine if the swim bladders contain parvalbumin and thus 
whether isinglass used in processing of alcoholic beverages (beer, champagne, ale and 
wine) might be a risk for fish allergic individuals. 
 5  
 
 
Risks 
 
Skin prick testing is considered a relatively safe procedure and is performed daily in 
allergy clinics (14). The risk of anaphylactic shock with skin testing is less that 1% (17-
22. The most common side effect is the development of an itchy spot (like a mosquito 
bite) in the area of skin where a positive reaction occurs.  The itchiness resolves after a 
few minutes and the skin lesion should resolve within an hour or two. 
 
The drawing of blood from subjects is also an everyday procedure but unforeseen risks 
can occur. The most common side effect is a small discoloration or bruise that may 
remain at the site for several days. There may be mild temporary pain occasionally 
associated with insertion of the needle.  In very rare cases, a local infection may occur 
at the site of the venipuncture.   
 
The subject will be informed that there may be some slight pain and discomfort with the 
skin prick test and blood draw.  Nursing and physician staff will be present during skin 
prick testing.  In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a reaction during skin 
prick testing emergency supplies and medications will be available and be administered 
according to the level and severity of reaction.  
 
5.  RECRUITING PROCEDURES 
 
Each clinical investigator will determine the best recruitment procedure for his or her 
location.  Suggested methods include newspaper ads, flyers and posters in the clinic, 
and recruitment databanks may be available at some study centers.  Letters may also 
be sent to known fish-allergic individuals.  The clinical investigator must include 
examples of letters, ads and posters when submitting their proposal to their human 
subjects use committee.  All recruiting techniques must be approved by the clinical 
investigator’s local human subjects use committee. 
 
6.  COMPENSATION 
 
A per subject fee will be negotiated with FARRP before the study starts.  Each site 
should propose a per subject fee that will defray the clinical investigator costs for staff, 
supplies, equipment and facility use, fees for services, human subjects use proposal 
preparation and submission fees, and compensation to the challenge subject.  
Compensation should be provided to each subject to defray any of their costs when 
allowed (i.e. travel, work time lost).  The compensation amount is to be determined by 
and paid by each clinical investigator.  The amount should be included in the per subject 
cost agreement that will be made with FARRP before the study starts.  Instructions for 
invoicing FARRP will be included when challenge materials are distributed to the clinical 
investigator.  Payment of invoices will not be made without receipt of deliverables by 
FARRP. 
 6 
7.  INFORMED CONSENT FORMS 
 
Each clinical investigator will be required to produce the appropriate consent forms to 
conform to the criteria and formats required by their local human subjects use 
committee.   
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
This procedure will vary from site to site so the procedure must be written by each 
clinical investigator.   
 
8.  MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
Each clinical site has specific rules about maintaining confidentiality.   The “FARRP Skin 
Reactivity to Fish Study-Food Allergy Questionnaire” and the “FARRP Skin Reactivity to 
Fish Study Data Sheet“ will be completed for each subject.  These forms do not contain 
subject names, but subject number and subject initials.  Originals will be sent to 
FARRP.  At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln the questionnaire and the data sheet will 
be stored in a locked file in the Clinical Study Coordinators office.  Only the Clinical 
Study Coordinator and the Co-Directors of FARRP will have access to this information.  
In publications or reports using information collected from this work, the subjects will 
either be referred to as a collective or be identified by a subject number or other 
appropriate blinded designation.  Materials will be kept for 5 years after the completion 
of the study.  
 
9.  COPY OF QUESTIONNAIRE AND DATASHEETS   
 
Copies of the ““FARRP Skin Reactivity to Fish Study-Food Allergy Questionnaire” and 
the “FARRP Skin Reactivity to Fish Study Data Sheet” are included for submittal with 
clinical investigators’ proposal to their institute’s human subjects use committee. 
 
Funding  
This project is being funded by the Food Allergy Research & Resource Program of the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE USA.  If you require a letter indicating this, 
contact Julie A. Nordlee, FARRP Clinical Study Coordinator.   
 
Contract 
Each clinical investigator will be asked to sign a contract with FARRP and the University 
of Nebraska which will detail the deliverables to FARRP, the agreed upon per subject 
cost and details regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement between FARRP 
and the clinical investigator and their institution.

A. Introduction: 
 
Isinglass is prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the 
primary component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for 
collagen preparations.  In the allergenicity assessment of novel proteins, pepsin digestion is one 
of the criteria used to evaluate their potential allergenicity (Taylor and Hefle, 2002).  Although 
isinglass is not a novel protein in human diets, its comparative resistance to pepsin digestion 
should be a useful measure of its potential allergenicity.  If rapidly hydrolyzed by pepsin, less 
likelihood exists that isinglass would sensitize susceptible individuals.  Sensitization to isinglass 
has not been reported, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines 
for many years.    This report describes the digestive stability of isinglass samples to pepsin in an 
identical approach used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins 
considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). 
 
B.  Materials and Methods: 
 
Test sample
 
Isinglass (lot number 1839) was provided obtained from A. B. Vickers, Burton-upon-Trent, U.K. 
by FARPP.  The isinglass sample (received in dry state) was dissolved in distilled water at a 
concentration of 5 mg/ml.  The isinglass solution remained slightly turbid.  Pre-incubation at 
lower pH (pH = 2) partially overcame this turbidity, but in order to make a fair comparison with 
other food proteins tested for digestibility, pre-incubation at low pH was not done.  Crude peanut 
extract (CPE) was prepared from ground peanut (Runner variety) as described previously 
(Koppelman et al., 2001).  
 
Pepsin
 
 
Pepsin was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), catalogue number P-6887.  This product 
was chosen because it has the highest specific activity commercially available (3300 U/mg for 
the particular batch), and because other researchers investigating the digestibility behavior of 
potentially allergenic proteins used this product as well (Thomas et al, 2004).  Pepsin was stored 
as a lyophilized powder, as supplied by the manufacturer, at – 20 C.  The ratio of 10 U of pepsin 
per ug of test protein was used throughout the study, according to Thomas et al. (2004).  Pepsin 
was dissolved immediately before the digestion experiment and used within 15 minutes in order 
prevent possible loss of activity due to auto-digestion.

Tubes containing 1.52 ml of simulated gastric fluid (SGS) were prepared.  SGF was used at pH 
1.2 (0.063 N HCl, containing 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin) and pH 2.0 (0.01 N HCl, 
containing 35 mM NaCl and 4000 U pepsin).  In a control experiment the potential effect of 
adding protein (pepsin, test proteins) on the final pH was tested, and found to be negligible (less 
than 0.05 pH points).   SGF was pre-warmed to 37 C for 5 minutes and 80 ul of 5 mg/ml 
isinglass was added at time point t = 0. For CPE, due to a lower solubility, SGF was prepared at 
a higher concentration such that the addition of 400 ul of 1 mg/ml CPE resulted in the same final 
concentration of HCl, NaCl, pepsin, and isinglass.  Samples of 200 ul were collected at time 
points: 0.5 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10, min, 20 min, 30 min and 60 min.  Samples were immediately 
stopped by mixing with 70 ul of 200 mM NaHCO
3 (pH = 11.0) and 70 ul of 5 times concentrated 
Laemmli electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli et al, 1970) containing 40% glycerol, 20% SDS, 5% 
b-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 M TRIS (pH 6.8) and 0.05% bromophenol blue.  The samples of 0.5 
min, 1 min, 2 min and 5 min were heated for 5 minutes at > 75 C directly after taking the sample 
of time point 5 min.  Samples of other time points were heated immediately after sampling.  All 
samples were stored at – 20 C until analysis by SDS-PAGE.  
 
The sample of time point t = 0 min was prepared by stopping and heating SGF prior to the 
addition of test protein.  After adding the isinglass, the samples were heated again to ensure full 
denaturation.  Pepsin auto-digestion was tested by adding 80 ul of water to SGF and incubation 
of 60 minutes as described for test proteins.  Protein stability at low pH was tested by preparing 
SGF without pepsin, and incubating the test protein for 60 minutes. 
 
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
 
 
SDS-PAGE was performed generally according to Laemmli (Laemmli, et al. 1970) with the 
MiniProtean system (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA) using 10-20% precast gels or with manually 
prepared 15% homogenous gels.  The molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen 
(Carlsbad, CA. USA, Mark12 catalogue number LC5677, ranging from 2.5 to 200 kD) and were 
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 ul per sample was loaded and 
electrophoresis was stopped just before the bromophenol blue-containing front reached the end 
of the gel.  
 
Two methods for gel staining were used. First, the novel Page-Blue method from Fermentas was 
used (Hanover, MD).  This method is said to be more sensitive compared to classical Coomassie 
staining method.  Gels were destained overnight. For the analyses of the peanut protein digestion 
(performed earlier), the classical method was used: gels were stained in 1% Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue R-250 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 50% methanol/20% acetic acid over night. 
Subsequently, gels were washed with 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 5 minutes and destained 
with 50% methanol/20% acetic acid for 30 minutes.  After that, gels were further destained with 
25% methanol/10% acetic acid for 2 hours.

All gels were scanned with a regular laboratory scanner, and scans were not optimized in any 
way in order to allow an objective comparison. 
 
C. Results: 
 
Characterization of isinglass 
 
Undigested isinglass showed bands in the molecular weight range of 100-200 kD, but also three 
more distinct bands at approximately 25 kD, 45 kD, and 100 kD, and one vague band between 6 
and 14 kD (Figure 1).    
 
Digestibility of isinglass at pH 1.2
 
Upon incubation with pepsin at pH = 1.2, isinglass is digested rapidly.  The high molecular 
weight protein fraction was only visible at time points t = 0, 0.5 and 2 minutes. (Figure 2).  At 
time point 0.5 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible.  After 2 
minutes, no high molecular weight protein is observed.  At time points 0.5, 2, and 5 minutes, 
some intermediate molecular weight protein/peptide smear (range: 30 to 60 kD) is observed, but 
only vaguely.  This protein/peptide digestion product is completely further digested at later time 
points.  
 
Digestibility of isinglass at pH 2
 
Upon incubation with pepsin at a somewhat higher pH of 2, isinglass is digested rapidly, but 
some proteins/peptides remained for a longer time as compared to digestion at pH 1.2.  At time 
points 0.5 and 2 minutes, a distinct band at approximately 100 kD remains visible (Figure 3).  
This band disappeared after 5 minutes, somewhat later compared to the incubation at pH = 1.2.  
In the time span from 0.5 to 30 minutes, some intermediate weight protein/peptides were visible, 
and these disappeared after 30 minutes.  
 
 
Isinglass at both pH 1.2 and 2.0 appears to be labile in the absence of pepsin (Figure 2, 3). 
Pepsin auto-digestion experiments at pH = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 show that the pepsin band in SDS-
PAGE analysis is unaffected during the time course of the experiment (Figure 4), demonstrating 
that observed bands in the intermediate and low molecular weight areas after incubation with 
pepsin do not originate from pepsin. 
 
Digestibility of crude peanut extract - reference
 
Crude peanut extract (CPE) (Figure 5) is characterized by a typical band pattern showing Ara h 1 
(at approximately 63 kD as an intense, uniform band), Ara h 2 (a doublet at approximately 20 
kD), Ara h 3 (a triplet at 42-45 kD, and bands at 25 kD, and 14 kD), and Ara h 6 (a single, less 
intense band at approximately 15 kD), shown in Figure 5, left lane, arrows indicate the identified 
allergens).  Incubation with pepsin at both  pH  = 2.0 and pH = 1.2 shows that the majority of 
Ara h 1 disappears within 0.5 min, as well as the 42-45 kD bands of Ara h 3 (note that the 
remaining thick band at this height is pepsin).  In contrast, Ara h 2, in particular the heavy 
isoform remains stable for the time course of the experiment.  Ara h 6 also shows a high stability 
during the experiment, probably even more stable than Ara h 2.  Other bands in CPE are difficult Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-06-2006

to assign, especially during the time course of the digestion experiment where a series of 
peptides are generated as a results of degradation of the higher molecular weight proteins (Ara h 
1 mainly).

Isinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, in a similar approach as used for assessing the 
digestibility of several allergens and also proteins considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 
2004).  Digestibility of peanut allergens was used as a reference. Compared to certain peanut 
allergens, isinglass is digested quickly.   
  
Limitations/speculation 
 
The nature of the intermediate bands is not known.  They may represent isinglass-derived 
peptides, or other fish proteins. The vague band between 6 and 14 kD may possibly represent 
parvalbumin, with a molecular weight of 12.3 kD, but from this investigation, there are no 
experimental data to support this.  However, all of the protein bands in isinglass are quickly 
digested by pepsin.

REPORT COD PARVALBUMIN ELISA
Date: August 19th of 2006
Author: Dr. M. Hessing
Signature:Parvalbumin ELISA 
The various samples received in July and August 2006 were extracted and analyzed using 
the sandwich ELISA for cod parvalbumin as described in the FARRP report (Dr. S. 
Hefle). Results are expressed in μg soluble parvalbumin/ g dry weight (ppm) based on 
the assumption that all soluble parvalbumin is extracted from the sample and 
demonstrates comparable immunoreactivity as cod parvalbumin. Results are shown in 
tables below.

In general, the various samples react limitedly. Dilutions were not parallel with dilutions 
of cod parvalbumin, and true quantification therefore is not possible. The non-parallelism 
is illustrated by the high SD’s (same order of magnitude as response), and by the 
increasing calculated value for higher diluted extracts (data not shown here). The non-
parallelism may be caused by differences in affinity of cod parvalbumin and parvalbumin 
of other fishes. Differences between the various samples are clearly visible. These may be 
explained by differences in parvalbumin content, but due to the issues mentioned above, 
this is not conclusive.PodiCeps BV

A. Introduction: 
 
Commercial monoclonal antibodies directed against frog and carp parvalbumin are available.  A 
commercial monoclonal antibody directed against frog parvalbumin has been used in one study 
as a screening tool in selecting a cDNA library for mackerel parvalbumin, and also was 
successfully used in the development of a mackerel parvalbumin ELISA (Hamada et al., 2003). 
Frog parvalbumin shares 43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species 
(according to a search of a database of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  
Carp parvalbumin has a rather high degree of sequence homology with cod parvalbumin so the 
use of the anti-carp parvalbumin antibody might be even more promising for the detection of 
potentially allergenic fish parvalbumin.  Thus, an evaluation of the commercial anti-frog and 
anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies was conducted for applicability/efficacy in 
designing an ELISA for the detection of residual parvalbumin in isinglass.  Simultaneously (and 
as described in FARRP-08-2006), polyclonal antisera were produced against purified codfish 
parvalbumin and used in the development of an ELISA for detection of residual parvalbumin in 
isinglass.  
 
Isinglass is a commonly used ingredient for the clarification of beers and ales.  Isinglass is 
prepared from the swim bladders of various species of tropical fish.  Collagen is the primary 
component of isinglass.  Molecular weights of well over 200 kD are described for collagen 
preparations.  Fish collagen is not a major fish allergen but parvalbumin is widely considered as 
the major pan-allergen from fish (Taylor et al., 2004).  Although swim bladders are composed 
primarily of collagen, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 
1989).  However, the presence of parvalbumin in fish swim bladders has not been thoroughly 
investigated and certainly not from the species of fish used to produce isinglass.  Sensitization to 
isinglass has not been reported nor have allergic reactions been reported in fish-sensitized 
individuals, despite its widespread use as a clarifying agent for beers, ales, and wines.  This 
observation suggests that fish collagen is an unlikely allergen and that isinglass contains 
insufficient parvalbumin to elicit reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
   
The anti-frog parvalbumin antibody was recently shown to detect parvalbumin found in the 
edible muscle tissues of cod, carp, catfish, and tilapia but not tuna (Chen et al., 2006).  The 
results demonstrating the ability of the anti-frog parvalbumin monoclonal antibody to detect fish 
parvalbumins will be shared herein because sufficient cross-reactivity may exist to allow 
detection of parvalbumin residues in commercial isinglass.  The anti-frog and anti-carp 
parvalbumin antibodies were evaluated for their ability to detect parvalbumin from various fish 
species in both ELISA and western blotting formats.   Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

MO.  
• Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (Swant 235):  obtained from Swant (Bellinzona, 
Switzerland).

2. Frozen carp, catfish, cod, tuna and tilapia fillet were purchased from local market in Lincoln, 
NE and isinglass samples were provided by A. B. Vickers of the U.K. All fish and isinglass 
samples were stored at -20 °C prior to extraction.   
3. Recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01) was provided by Dr. Ines Swoboda, Medical 
University of Vienna, Austria.  
 
 C.  Methods: 
 
Protein extraction from fish tissue and isinglass 
 
Five grams of each fish sample were extracted with 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 
0.01M, pH 7.4), with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 tablet of Complete® EDTA-free protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).  Samples were blended in 50 mL of 
extraction buffer for 1 min using a Waring blender.  The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 x 
g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant solution was collected and stored at -20 °C until analysis.  
Isinglass samples were extracted by PBS at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) with continuous shaking 
overnight at 4 °C.  The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 x g for 30 min at 4°C and the 
supernatant was used as protein extract. 
 
Protein assay
 
The protein concentration of each extract was determined using a Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) as a standard. 
 
SDS polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
 
Fish extracts were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), containing 
2- mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent, and heated at 95 °C for five min. Ten µL of each fish 
extract (containing 10 µg protein) was loaded onto a Novex® tris-glycine 10-20% ready gel 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Five µL Precision Plus ProteinTM standards (Bio-Rad) were also 
used. Electrophoresis was carried out in a SureLockTM Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen).  
Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Invitrolon PVDF membranes using an 
Xcell II™ Blot Module (Invitrogen) for immunoblotting.  Transfer of proteins from the gel to 
each of the PVDF membranes was verified by staining the membranes with Ponceau S stain Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 7 of 21 
  
(Sigma-Aldrich).  Additional gels were stained with Brilliant Blue G colloidal concentrate 
(Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions.  Images of freshly destained gels 
were captured and analyzed using a Kodak GL440 image station and 1D image analysis software 
(Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY).  
 
2D electrophoresis
  
Isoelectric focusing was performed on 7 cm nonlinear pH 3-10 Zoom® strips in a Zoom® 
IPGRunner™ system (Invitrogen).  The strips were rehydrated for 1 hr at room temperature in a 
solution consisting of 7 M urea, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1% pH 3-10 
ampholytes (Invitrogen) and 35 µg (for protein stain) or 3.5 µg (for immunoblotting)  fish protein 
extract.  Focusing conditions were controlled with a multi-step program: 200 V for 20 min, 450 
V for 15 min, 750 V for 15 min and 2000 V for 30 min. After focusing and prior to the second 
dimension, strips were equilibrated in a mixture of one mL NuPage® reducing agent 
(Invitrogen) and 9 mL 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min, then alkylated 
by incubation with 125 mM iodoacetamide in 1X NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 
15 min.  The second dimension electrophoresis was conducted in a Novex® 4-20% Tris-Glycine 
Zoom® Gel (Invitrogen).  Completed gels were used for immunoblotting and protein stain.  The 
pI gradient of the Zoom® strips was calibrated by a low range pI isoelectric focusing calibration 
kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). 
 
Immunoblotting
 
Proteins separated in gels were transferred to PVDF membranes using an XCell II™ Blot 
Module (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  Following transfer, 
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS (PBS-NFDM) for two hours at room 
temperature and washed four times with PBS containing 0.5% v/v Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 
vigorous shaking.  The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-frog Mab 
(Parv-19) diluted 1:5,000 or anti-carp Mab (Swant 235) diluted 1:10,000 in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  
After four washes in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for one hour with goat anti-mouse 
IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), diluted 
1:5000 (v/v) in 2.5% PBS-NFDM.  Membranes were washed four times with PBS-T and wetted 
in SuperSignal west Dura extended duration substrates (Pierce Biotechnology) to visualize the 
immunocomplex. The chemiluminescent signal was captured by exposing Kodak® BioMax light 
films for various times (Eastman Kodak Company).   
 
Competitive ELISA
 
A 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nagle Nunc international, Rochester, NY) was coated 
with 20µg protein/ml carp extract (100µl/well) overnight at 4˚C.  After coating, the free binding 
sites of the plate were blocked by 350µl/well 0.1% porcine gelatin in PBS for 2 hr at room 
temperature.  Serially diluted fish extracts, isinglass extracts, recombinant carp parvalbumin, 
PBS solution, or isinglass extracts spiked with a known amount of  recombinant carp 
parvalbumin were added to the blocked plate (50µl/well) as inhibitors followed by adding an 
equal volume of anti-carp Mab, diluted 1:15,000(v/v) in blocking buffer.  After incubation at 
37˚C for 1 hr, the plate was washed 4 times with PBS-T. Following washing, anti-mouse IgG -Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 8 of 21 
  
alkaline phosphatase conjugate, diluted 1:5000(v/v) in blocking buffer, was added to plate and 
incubated for 1 hr at 37˚C.  After washing, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and the 
color development was read at 410nm on a MRX microplate reader (Dynex technologies, 
Chantlly, VA).

Electrophoresis and immunoblots of fish protein extracts
 
 
1D electrophoresis and western blot
 
Initially, the protein profiles of cod, carp, catfish, tilapia, and tuna were assessed by SDS-PAGE, 
shown in Figure1.1A.  All five species showed similar protein banding patterns above a 
molecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular 
weights among fish species.  Either one or two distinct bands of high concentration were 
observed in the molecular weight range of 10-12 kDa expected for parvalbumins in carp (2), 
catfish (2), cod (1), and tilapia (2).  No significant bands were noted in the tuna sample below 25 
kDa.   
 
Immunoblots obtained using the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab are shown in Figure 1.1B.  All 
visible fish protein bands in the molecular weight range of 10-13 kDa were recognized by anti-
frog parvalbumin Mab.  The antibody did not bind to any bands in tuna (Figure 1.1B, lane 5).  
The molecular weight and relative abundance (determined by densitometry using the Kodak 
image analysis software) of the antibody-binding fish proteins is summarized in Table 1.1.  Lane 
6 of Figure1.1B contains recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01) with a molecular weight 
of 11.4 kDa (Swoboda, 2002). 
 
Immunoblots using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab failed to provide clear profile of antibody 
binding bands, which were masked by strong background.  In an effort to improve the 
background, several blocking reagents were tested in the immunoblotting, including non-fat dry 
milk, bovine serum albumin and porcine gelatin.  However, no immunoblot of satisfactory 
quality was obtained that is comparable to those using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  More 
optimization work is needed to reveal the binding pattern of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to fish 
proteins on immunoblots.

Subsequently, the protein profile of cod extract was compared to an additional six species of 
fish.  The protein and immunoblotting profiles of the seven fish species were revealed by SDS-
PAGE, shown in Figure1.2.  As with the previously evaluated 5 species and based on protein 
staining with Coomassie blue, these 6 species showed similar protein banding patterns above a 
molecular weight of 25 kDa.  Differences in protein bands were observed at lower molecular 
weights among fish species.  Either one or two distinct bands of high concentration were 
observed in the molecular weight range of 10-13 kDa expected for parvalbumins.

Immunoblots using anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mab show both antibodies can detect 
parvalbumins from most of the fish species tested.  Little non-specific binding of the two 
antibodies to other proteins was observed.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher 
sensitivity than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab since similar signal intensities were achieved within 
shorter exposure time when anti-carp Mab was used.  As noted with the earlier studies of 5 
species, it should be noted that anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mab bind to parvalbumin 
from various fish species with different specificities.  Interestingly, the strongest binding 
apparently obtained for anti-frog parvalbumin Mab was with the parvalbumins from redfish and 
flounder.  These same two parvalbumins showed very low apparent binding to anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab.  Meanwhile, anti-carp parvalbumin Mab had high apparent specificity to 
parvalbumins from cod, cusk, hake and haddock, which exhibited weak apparent binding to anti-
frog parvalbumin Mab.  Both antibodies appear to bind well to pollock parvalbumin.

These additional results further suggest that anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin antibodies have 
some value in the detection of parvalbumin from the muscle tissues of a wide range of species.   
 
2D electrophoresis and western blot

conjunction with immunoblots using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab.  Tuna fish was not included

done with cusk, flounder, hake, haddock, redfish, and pollock  Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

Carp contained five isoforms that bound to the anti-frog parvalbumin antibody. Three of the five 
polypeptides had a molecular weight of 10.6 kDa and the other two were of 11.6 kDa. Their pI 
values ranged from 3.5-4.25, based on protein markers in the low range pI (Amersham 
Biosciences), data not shown.  Catfish had two fairly strong antibody-binding proteins at pI 4.25 
and a barely visible spot at pI 3.5.  Only one antibody-binding protein was observed in cod fish, 
with a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and pI 3.6.  Anti-frog parvalbumin antibody recognized two 
bands in tilapia.  Even though these two proteins showed similar intensity in SDS-PAGE (Figure 
1.3 D1), their antibody-binding capacities were markedly different (Figure 1.3 D2). The 11.1 
kDa protein with pI 3.6 exhibited much stronger binding than the 12.1 kDa subunit with pI 4.0.  
This suggested that the anti-frog pravlbumin Mab binds to different parvalbumin isoforms with 
different specificity.

Method development of competitive ELISA 
 
Figure 1.4 shows IgG binding inhibition curves of soluble carp and cod protein extracts that 
compete with bound carp protein on the ELISA plate using soluble anti-frog or anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab.  The inhibition curves of both carp and cod shifted to the left (the lower 
concerntration end) when anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (solid lines in Figure 1.4) was used instead 
of anti-frog parvalbumin Mab (dot lines in Figure 1.4).  This suggested that less soluble fish 
protein was needed to inhibit binding of anti-carp parvalbumin Mab to solid-phased carp protein 
than when anti-frog parvalbumin Mab is used.  As a result, the competitive ELISA using anti-
carp parvalbumin Mab has higher sensitivity in detecting fish parvalbumins than when anti-frog 
parvalbumin Mab is used.  It should be noted that the competitive ELISA was not conducted by 
using more concentrated primary antibodies (1:5,000) than the optimized dilution (1:15,000) as 
described in methods section. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.4. Inhibition curves generated by soluble carp and cod protein extracts in competitive 
ELISA using anti-frog or anti-carp parvalbumin Mab (diluted 1:5,000) to bind to solid-phased 
carp protein. 
 
A competitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was developed to detect parvalbumin in 
fish and fish derived products due to the superior sensitivity of the anti-carp Mab compared to 
that of the anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Using the amount of recombinant carp parvalbumin 
needed to obtain 20% inhibition as a detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of detecting 
0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin in a PBS extract (or 1 µg/g on a weight/weight basis). 
 
The competitive ELISA is developed to test fish parvalbumin in fish and fish derived products.  
Since the complex biochemical constituents in the extract of a matrix such as isinglass or fish 
gelatin might interfere with the assay, we wanted to evaluate the possibility that a high collagen Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 14 of 21 
  
content matrix might alter assay results.  Therefore, inhibition curves were obtained by serially 
diluting recombinant carp parvalbumin in PBS (no matrix effect) or in 10% (w/v) fish gelatin 
extract (Norland Products, Inc.), simulating fish protein matrix effects (Figure 1.5).  The fish 
collagen extract may contain an unknown amount of fish parvalbumin.  The results showed a 
dramatic difference in the slopes of the two inhibition curves, which suggested the standard 
curve generated in a PBS solution of recombinant carp parvalbumin was not suitable to evaluate 
parvalbumin content in the fish gelatin extract. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.5. Competitive ELISA detecting recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp c1.01) in PBS or 
fish collagen protein extract. 
 
It is possible to overcome the problem of matrix effect by spiking a known amount of 
recombinant carp parvalbumin into the sample protein extract and testing both spiked and 
unspiked samples in the same assay.  At least theoretically both spiked and non-spiked samples 
experience similar matrix effects and should exhibit parallel inhibition curves.  Figure 1.6 shows 
an example of competitive ELISA carried out on an isinglass sample.  In this case the sample 
was spiked with 20 µg recombinant carp parvalbumin per g sample and analyzed simulateously 
with an equivalent unspiked sample.  Based on the inhibition curves, a dilution representing 0.28 
mg dry weight of spiked sample and a dilution representing 1.57 mg of unspiked sample both 
exhibited 50% inhibition (contain equivalent amounts of parvalbumin).  Assuming the 
parvalbumin content in non-spiked sample is X µg/g, the amount of parvalbumin in both non-
spiked and spiked sample is 
1.57mg*X µg/g=0.28 mg *(X µg/g +20 µg/g) 
 
Solving the equation,  
X=4.3 µg/g Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 15 of 21 
  
Thus this specific sample of isinglass contains 4.3 ppm parvalbumin.  This example 
demonstrates that this assay can be used to measure the equivalent content of parvalbumin in 
isinglass samples or those of other similar matrices.

Analysis of Parvalbumin Content of Fish Tissues by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp 
Parvalbumin Mab 
 
Competitive ELISA using anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was performed under optimized 
conditions to detect parvalbumins in various fish protein extracts and the results were showed in 
Figure 1.7.  Protein concentration of fish extracts that achieved 50% inhibition are calculated as 
1.8, 0.4, 2.8, 0.7 and 10 µg/mL for carp, catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna respectively, which is 
equivalent to 0.1  µg/mL recombinant carp parvalbumin.  If recombinant carp parvalbumin 
needed for 20% inhibition is defined as detection limit, this ELISA method is capable of 
detecting parvalbumin content equivalent to as low as 0.05 µg/mL carp parvalbumin. 
 
The inhibition curves of most fish extracts except catfish and cod exhibited similar slopes to that 
of recombinant carp parvalbumin.   It is not known if the slopes of catfish and cod were 
significant different from the others.  The slope differences can be explained by the existence of 
differing specificities for the antibody binding to the epitopes of catfish or cod parvalbumin. 
Nevertheless, the matrix effect of fish extracts may also introduce slope variation.   
 
Carp extract containing 1.8 µg/mL total proteins exhibited inhibition equivalent to 0.1 µg/mL 
recombinant carp parvalbumin.  That is, the abundance of parvalbumin in carp extract is 
0.1/1.8=5.5%.  Similarly, parvalbumin abundances of catfish, cod, tilapia and tuna in protein Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 16 of 21 
  
extracts were estimated at 25, 3.6, 14.3 and 1% respectively.  These numbers are different from 
the abundance results calculated by SDS-PAGE densitometry shown in Table 1.1, which 
suggested the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab binds to fish parvalbumin from various fish species 
with different specificity.   It is interesting to observe detectable parvalbumin in tuna extract that 
is not visible in either SDS-PAGE or westernblot using anti-frog parvalbumin Mab.  Anti-carp 
parvalbumin Mab may have higher specificity for tuna parvalbumin than anti-frog antibody.

Analysis of Parvalbumin Content of Isinglass by Competitive ELISA Using Anti-Carp 
Parvalbumin Mab 
 
The competitive ELISA method described above using anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal 
antibody was used to assess the levels of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Initially,  nine samples of 
isinglass produced from the maws of seven different species of fish were analyzed as shown in 
Table 1.2.  These isinglass samples were manufactured in typical fashion with milling but no 
further processing steps; thus these would be considered as unprocessed fish maws.  A low, but 
variable, level of residual parvalbumin was found in isinglass from all of the fish species.  Based 
on the comparatively higher level of residual parvalbumin found in the isinglass manufactured 
from the Nile perch maws, this species of fish was eliminated as a source of maws for the 
production of isinglass.   
 
Since parvalbumin is a water-soluble protein that binds calcium, washing was introduced as a 
commercial unit operation in an attempt to decrease residual parvalbumin levels.  Normally, 
unprocessed maws would be washed with water.  Thus, the “before treatment” column in Table

phosphate buffer wash.  Based on limited experiments, the determination was made that the 
phosphate buffer wash was perhaps the most effective in reducing parvalbumin levels.  
Somewhat variable results were obtained for isinglass produced from maws of various fish 
species but the phosphate buffer wash appeared to be effective.  This experiment was not 
repeated.  The sources of the fish swim bladders used to produce these samples of isinglass are 
representative of the range of species used in the commercial production of isinglass. 
 
Table 1.4 shows the parvalbumin content of some commercial isinglass samples provided by the 
isinglass manufacturers.  These samples were selected after the elimination of Nile perch as a 
commercial source of maws and after development of the phosphate buffer washing operation.  
The sample codes can be matched to the descriptions provided in Table 1.3.  It should be noted 
that, for some unknown reason, the results of this batch of assay were apparently lower than 
what we tested previously.  The reference isinglass sample was tested on this occasion as usual 
and it yielded a result of 1.8 µg/g, much less than previous results (4.6-5.0 µg/g); the earlier, 
higher level was confirmed on numerous occasions.  Some potential assay problems, such as 
poor protein extraction, degradation of coating protein or anti-parvalbumin antibody, have been 
excluded as possible causes of the lower than expected results.

E. Discussion:

Parvalbumins share considerable sequence homology among fishes.  Frog parvalbumin shares 
43-88% sequence homology with parvalbumins from fish species (according to a search of a 
database of sequences of known allergens; www.allergenonline.com).  Anti-frog and anti-carp 
parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding to the parvalbumins in fish muscle 
tissues from several divergent fish species (Chen et al., 2006).  We were unable to obtain fish 
muscle tissues from the species of fish used to manufacture isinglass but these results suggest 
that parvalbumin is present in the muscle tissues of most, if not all, fish species.  Of course, 
swim bladders rather than muscle tissues are used as the raw material for preparation of 
isinglass.  However, swim bladders are also likely to contain parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989).   
 
While anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin Mabs detect the presence of parvalbumin in muscle 
tissues from the muscle tissues of all fish species tested in this study, parvalbumin from various 
fish species show differences in specificity to each of these antibodies.  Anti-frog parvalbumin 
Mab appears to be most useful for detecting parvalbumin from flounder, pollock and redfish 
compared to the other species tested.  Anti-carp parvalbumin Mab exhibited higher specifity for 
carp, cod, cusk, hake, haddock and pollock parvalbumins than anti-frog parvalbumin Mab, 
however, it displayed much weaker binding to parvalbumins from flounder and redfish.  In 2-
dimensional electrophoresis with immunoblotting only, the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was able 
to detect parvalbumin from tuna.   
 
These electrophoresis and immunoblotting results demonstrate convincingly that commercial 
anti-parvalbumin antibodies are able to detect the presence of parvalbumin in a range of fish 
species.  Certainly, the quantitative reliability of an ELISA based upon either of these antibodies 
may be dependent upon the species origin of the fish-based ingredient that is being evaluated.  
However, even though isinglass is made from species of fish that were not evaluated here, a 
sufficient number of species were evaluated to indicate that these antibodies should have some 
utility in the detection of parvalbumin residues in isinglass. 
 
The anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was employed for the development of a parvalbumin ELISA.  
Because sequence homology was greater between other fish parvalbumin and carp parvalbumin 
compared to frog parvalbumin, the choice of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab was considered as 
advantageous.  The inhibition curves presented in Figure 1.4 also indicate that the anti-carp 
parvalbumin MAb was the superior choice.  While a successful ELISA method was developed, 
its quantitative accuracy for detecting residual parvalbumin from species other than carp is 
undoubtedly compromised to some degree by the variability in binding specificity discussed 
above.     
 
Residual parvalbumin was detected in samples of commercial isinglass using the competitive 
ELISA method with anti-carp parvalbumin Mab.  Obviously, some caution is warranted in the 
interpretation of these results because of the previously discussed differences in binding 
specificity of the anti-carp parvalbumin Mab with parvalbumins from the various fish species.  
The anti-carp parvalbumin Mab is reasonably good at detecting parvalbumins from cod, cusk, 
hake, pollock, haddock, carp, catfish, and tilapia based upon the binding specificity.  This Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-07-2006

demonstrates that this antibody has reasonably broad specificity.  The rather low level of 
sensitivity (1 µg/g or 1 ppm) of the ELISA also suggests that the method would detect 
parvalbumin residues in spite of the differences in binding specificities.  However, since this 
ELISA has not been applied to samples of the fish used in the manufacture of isinglass, we 
cannot categorically indicate that it would detect parvalbumin from those species.  Furthermore, 
the quantitative accuracy of this method cannot easily be substantiated.  However, its value in 
comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various approaches to the possible reduction of 
residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass would seem to be quite excellent. 
 
Since the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish contains parvalbumin (Gerday et al., 1989), a 
reasonable assumption would be that the swim bladders of the fish used in the manufacture of 
isinglass would also contain parvalbumin.  The nature of the collagen matrix and the known 
effectiveness of isinglass in removal of protein haze components of beers and ales suggest that 
isinglass might well bind parvalbumin.  The discovery of residual parvalbumin in isinglass 
indicates that this is the case.  Since parvalbumin is water-soluble, the expectation would be that 
the parvalbumin could be removed from isinglass by incorporation of washing steps in the 
manufacturing process.  In fact, washing with phosphate buffer is apparently effective in 
reduction of residual parvalbumin levels.  However, parvalbumin cannot be entirely eliminated 
from isinglass by washing.  Although this ELISA seems to provide reasonable proof that residual 
parvalbumin is present at rather low levels in isinglass, development of an ELISA based upon 
anti-cod parvalbumin was also pursued. 
 
The levels of residual isinglass found in commercial isinglass using the anti-carp parvalbumin 
monoclonal Ab ELISA are very low (1-5 ppm).  Since isinglass is very insoluble and used as a 
clarifying agent for beers and ales, the majority of any isinglass added to these beverages would 
be removed by precipitation, filtration, centrifugation or other means.  In all likelihood, much of 
the residual isinglass would also likely be removed.  Clearly, addition of isinglass to these 
beverages could result in the incorporation of extremely low levels of parvalbumin into these 
beverages.  Clinical challenges trials on the allergenicity of isinglass are needed to determine if 
the low levels of parvalbumin present in isinglass represent any risk whatsoever to fish-allergic 
individuals.

 Detection of fish parvalbumin in beer tank sediment (containing 
isinglass) by inhibition ELISA 
Lingyun Chen, 07-26-05 
 
Materials  
Sediment of beer tank from AB Vickers, received on 7/21/2005. 
Monoclonal mouse anti-carp parvalbumin antibody: Swant 235 
Recombinant carp parvalbumin (rCyp C1.01): provided by Dr. Ines Swoboda. 
 
Methods: 
• Protein extraction:   
The beer tank sediment sample was centrifuged at 15,000 xg for 5 min and the 
supernatant was collected as crude extract.    
 
• Spiking rCyp C1.01 into protein extract:  
Add 5ul 220μg/ml rCyp C1.01 into 995 μL extract. 
 
• Inhibition ELISA:    
Inhibition ELISA was set up based on FARRP ELISA protocols with 
modification. The procedure is briefly outlined as following: 
1. The microplates were coated with 20 μg/mL carp protein extract (100 μL/well) 
overnight at 4ºC; 
2. Blocking the wells with 350 μL of blocking buffer (0.1% porcine gelatin PBS) at 
room temperature for 2 hours; 
3. Adding 50 μL inhibitors (spiked or non-spiked extract, 2 fold serial dilution in PBS) 
and then 50 μL anti-carp antibody (dilution 1:15,000 in blocking buffer) to each 
well, incubate at 37ºC  for 1 hour; 
4. ELISA washing; 
5. Adding 100 μL /well secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG AP conjugated, 
Pierce 31323, diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer), incubate at 37ºC for 1 hour; 
6. ELISA washing; 
7. Adding ρ-NPP substrate 100 μL/well, incubate at room temperature for 30min; 
8. Stopping by adding 100 μL/well 1N NaOH and reading at 410nm. 
 
Results: 
 
• Inhibition ELISA 
Inhibition curves are shown in Fig 1 for unspiked and spiked beer sediment 
extracts. The level of rCyp C1.01 spiked in the extract was 1.1 μg/mL isinglass.  
Assuming the non-spiked extract contains X μg/mL parvalbumin, the spiked sample 
contains (X+1.1) μg/mL parvalbumin. Based on the inhibition curve, 0.025 mL unspiked 
extract (the second point from right end of the unspiked curve) and 0.0025 mL spiked 
extract exhibited similar inhibition.  Therefore, 0.025 mL unspiked extract and 0.0025 
mL spiked extract contained equal amount of parvalbumin.

A. Introduction 
 
All codfish-allergic individuals are reported to have IgE antibodies specific to Gad c 1, a 
parvalbumin, the first purified and characterized fish allergen (Elsayed and Bennich, 1975; 
Taylor et al., 2004). Parvalbumins are a group of highly related calcium binding proteins that are 
apparently important in regulating calcium flux in vertebrates.  Parvalbumins have also been 
identified as the major allergens in other fish species including salmon (Sal s 1), horse mackerel 
(Tra j 1), bigeye tuna (Thu o 1), carp (Cyp c 1) and several species of mackerels (Sco j 1, Sco a 
1, and Sco s 1) (Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 2000; Van Do et al., 1999; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Hamada et al., 2003).  Thus, parvalbumin is considered as a pan-allergen in 
fish (Bernhisel-Broadbent et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 1997).  Parvalbumin is 
also the major allergen of frog and the sequence of frog parvalbumin has been determined 
(Hilger et al., 2002; cross-reactivity exists between fish and frog parvalbumins (Hilger et al., 
2004).  Based on these studies it is clear that most vertebrates have at least two genes that encode 
highly identical forms of parvalbumin, that are classified primarily by pI values as alpha-
parvalbumins (pI ~ 5.0 or greater) and beta-parvalbumins (pI ~ 4.5 or less), and with sequences 
that align more closely within the two lineages (Swoboda et al., 2002).  However, it is not clear 
that definition based on pI value alone is meaningful.  Although mammals also have 
parvalbumins, they have not been reported as allergens.  While many of the parvalbumin 
sequences that have been reported as allergens appear to be of the beta-lineage by sequence 
alignment it is important to recognize that various fish species have between two and five 
parvalbumin proteins (Pechere et al., 1971; Giriga and Rehbein, 1988; Chen et al., 2006).   
Because we were interested in detecting the major allergenic protein from a variety of fish 
species it is important to evaluate species and isoform differences of the parvalbumins.  
Therefore we performed bioinformatics analyses to compare available sequences from 
commonly consumed fish parvalbumins in order to understand the structural and sequential 
similarity of these proteins.  This analysis will assist in the evaluation of the use of various 
antibodies such as anti-frog parvalbumin, anti-carp parvalbumin, and anti-cod parvalbumin in 
the detection of parvalbumins from a range of fish species. 
 
 
B. Methods 
 
Parvalbumin sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(www.ncbi.nih.gov).  A clustal W alignment was performed using DNASTAR with 
representative parvalbumins from a number of important species of fish: carp, cod, mackerel, 
perch, pike, pollack, salmon, silver hake, whiting and toadfish swimbladder.  If two or more Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006 
University of Nebraska  Page 6 of 12 
  
sequences were available for a given species, the most divergent were compared.  Results are 
presented as multiple sequence alignment, a percent identity and sequence divergence table and a 
phylogenetic tree (Figures 2.1-2.3).  In addition, a multiple sequence alignment to carp 
parvalbumin sequence GI# 17977825 was performed (Fig. 2.4) with another carp, three cod, one 
catfish, two frog parvalbumins and those of rat and bovine using the Align program (Scientific 
and Educational Software, Cary, NC), which uses a PAM250 scoring matrix with a mismatch 
penalty of 2, gap penalty of 4 and gap extension penalty of 1 (Chen et al., 2006).  The pI value 
for each sequence was calculated using Protean protein structure prediction and annotation 
software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).     
 
C. Results & Discussion 
 
The results are summarized graphically in Figures 2.1-2.4. 
 
Note that the sequences around the two calcium binding pockets are the most conserved, as 
expected (Fig. 2.1).  It is not clear whether IgE from most individuals with allergy to fish 
parvalbumin bind at the Ca+ binding region, though there are data that indicate the removal of 
calcium reduces IgE binding for at least some allergic subjects (Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998; 
Swoboda et al., 2002).  As aligned here, parvalbumin from the other fish are between 56 and 
91% identical to those of the three cod fish parvalbumin species (Fig. 2.2), which are themselves 
only 63 to 74% identical.  These high levels of sequence identity indicate a high likelihood of 
IgE cross-reactivity for at least some allergic subjects (Aalberse, 2000).  The studies by 
Bugajska-Schretter et al. (1998) and Swoboda et al. (2002) have also provided evidence that 
many individuals bind to parvalbumin from a number of these species including: carp, cod, eel, 
perch, salmon and tuna.  Cross-species inhibition has also demonstrated that pre-incubating sera 
of a number of fish allergic individuals with an extract of codfish significantly diminished or 
abolished IgE binding to carp, eel, perch, salmon and tuna demonstrating shared IgE binding 
(Bugajska-Schretter et al., 1998).   
 
The parvalbumin family of calcium binding proteins has diverged through evolutionary history, 
but the overall structure and the sequences are remarkably conserved across broad taxonomic 
groups.  An interesting finding is that many fish species have two or more “types” of 
parvalbumins that either represent, alpha- and beta-parvalbumins or functionally different beta-
isoforms that appear to be more conserved across species than across types, within a given taxa 
(Fig. 2.3).  For instance, one parvalbumin from salmon aligns better with pike than it does to the 
other salmon parvalbumin, which is closer to a parvalbumin from pollack.  However, these fish 
proteins are all more similar to each other than to the mammalian and amphibian alpha-
parvalbumins that are known and appear to be less allergenic (or alternatively more tolerogenic 
than the fish parvalbumins.  The biological significance of the two types of parvalumins is not 
understood (Swoboda et al., 2002).    
 
Together this information demonstrating the close sequence similarity across species of fish 
suggests that one or two parvalbumins may function well as diagnostic reagents (skin test Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-05-2006

reagents or IgE binding targets) for most individuals with fish allergy.  Conversely, antibodies to 
one or two of these fish parvalbumins could serve as reagents for detection of muscle tissue from 
a wide range of fish species.

A. Introduction: 
 
Since isinglass is primarily composed of fish collagen and collagen is not a major allergen from 
fish, the primary concern about the allergenicity of isinglass focuses around the possible 
presence of parvalbumin in isinglass.  Parvalbumin is the major allergen in several different 
species of fish including cod, salmon, carp, mackerels, and tuna (Elsayed and Aas, 1971; 
Bugajaska-Schretter et al., 1998; Van Do et al., 1999; Bugajska-Schretter et al., 2000; Hamada et 
al., 2003a; Hamada et al., 2004; Lindström et al., 1996; Van Do et al., 2005; Shiomi et al., 1998; 
Shiomi et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999 ) and is considered as a pan-allergen for individuals 
with fish allergy (Taylor et al., 2004).  The presence and levels of parvalbumin in the fish species 
used in the manufacturing of isinglass have not been examined.  However, because parvalbumin 
is present at some level in the majority of fish that have been investigated (Chen et al., 2006; 
Taylor et al., 2004), the assumption that parvalbumin is present in the fish species used to 
manufacture isinglass seems reasonable.  Furthermore, although parvalbumin is primarily found 
in fish muscle while isinglass is manufactured from swim bladders, parvalbumin has been 
identified in the swim bladder of the oyster toadfish (Gerday et al., 1989).  Again, it seems 
prudent to assume that the swim bladders of the fish species used to manufacture isinglass also 
contain parvalbumin.  Thus, the detection of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass 
seems to be a key factor in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of this material.  Because 
cod parvalbumin is the best characterized of the fish allergens, the development of an ELISA for 
parvalbumin was pursued with the hypothesis that this ELISA would also detect any residual 
parvalbumin in isinglass emanating from the swim bladders used in its manufacture. 
 
The development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA required several steps.  This first step was the 
purification of cod parvalbumin.  This portion of the research effort was sub-contracted to TNO 
in the Netherlands to a group headed by Aard de Jong., Ph.D.  This group succeeded in the 
purification of gram amounts of cod parvalbumin.  Their report can be found as Appendix A.

 Lead Scientist:  Sue L. Hefle, Ph.D., FARRP, University of Nebraska 
 
A. Introduction: 
 
Once purified cod parvalbumin was obtained (see Section IV), the production of antibodies was 
needed as the next step in the development of a cod parvalbumin ELISA.  The approach involved 
the production of polyclonal antibodies against cod parvalbumin in rabbits.  While the earlier 
ELISA efforts had involved use of commercial monoclonal antibodies against frog and carp 
parvalbumins (see FARRP-07-2006), the production of polyclonal antisera was selected in hopes 
that the specificity of the antibodies would be broader allowing more consistent detection of Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

parvalbumins from various fish species and the swim bladders of the species used to produce 
isinglass. 
 
 
 B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Purified cod parvalbumin was obtained from TNO Food Research Institute (Zeist, the 
Netherlands, see Section I and Appendix A).  Antibodies were produced at Covance 
Laboratories (Denver, PA, USA).  Three New Zealand female rabbits were injected with the 
purified cod parvalbumin using a standard immunization protocol (Harlow and Lane, 1988) and 
TiterMax adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).  Initial injections were 200 µg 
parvalbumin per rabbit intradermally, and booster injections were 100 µg subcutaneously every 
four weeks.  Blood serum was collected every three weeks and tested for response using a non-
competitive ELISA.  As of the second booster injection, titers (defined as the log reciprocal of 
the mid-linear portion of the titration curve) reached more than 10,000 in all rabbits.  A pool of 
two production bleeds from each rabbit (pool titer 100,000) was sent to Drs. Stef Koppelman 
(AllerTeQ) and Martin Hessing (Podiceps) for use in developing ELISAs for the detection of 
parvalbumin. 
 
 C.  Results & Discussion:  
 
High-titer polyclonal antisera against cod parvalbumin was obtained from the immunized 
rabbits.  This antisera was used to develop the cod parvalbumin ELISA (see Section III).

A. Introduction: 
 
Although it is widely recognized that parvalbumin is a pan-allergen from fish muscle tissues and 
the major allergen for fish-allergic individuals, no documentation exists to demonstrate the 
presence of parvalbumin in either fish flesh or fish maws from the species of fish used to 
manufacture isinglass.  This report describes the procurement of fish and fish maws from these 
species of fish and the preparation of extracts from those samples.  In the following phase of the 
investigations, an ELISA for the detection of cod parvalbumin was developed and used to assess Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

the parvalbumin content of these extracts.  In this section of the report, the extracts were 
analyzed for protein concentration and SDS-PAGE band pattern.  The extraction studies resulted 
in the selection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the preparation of the extracts on a larger 
scale.  
 
 
 B.  Materials & Methods: 
 
Fish samples
 
Whole fish and dried maws (swim bladder) were forwarded to Podiceps BV by various suppliers 
used by the isinglass manufacturers.  Table 1 gives a list of the samples obtained (6 maws, 6 
whole fish).  The fish samples were filleted, and clean fillets (essentially free of collagen-like 
tissue and fat) were used for preparation of extracts.  The remainder of the fish was discarded.  In 
this report, samples are referred to by species code (first column in Table 1) and the description 
maw or fish, the latter meaning fillet.

All maw samples arrived in dried condition.  The processing background of these samples was 
unknown. All fish samples arrived frozen, except for F 21/05, which arrived non-frozen and 
covered with mold.  Samples of maw and fish (after fillets were prepared) were stored until use 
at -20° C.

Extraction buffers 
Water, PBS and 0.9% salt solution were used to prepare extracts.  Although water and 0.9% salt 
solution are not buffers, the set of these extraction fluids are referred to as extraction buffers 
(water, PBS, 0.9% NaCl).  All three extraction buffers were sterile and pyrogen free solutions. 
PBS was from Fresenius Kabi (Schelle, Belgium, catalogue number N400500) and contained per 
liter: 8.2 g NaCl, 1.9 g Na
2HPO4·2H2Oand , 0.3 g NaH2PO4·2H2O (pH = 7.4).  Water and 0.9% 
NaCl were from Fresenius Kabi as well (catalogue numbers B230667 and 2660091, 
respectively).  Containers with extraction buffer were only used once after opening.  
 
Protein concentration determination
 
Bradford analysis was used, applying Bradford reagent from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, 
catalogue number B6916) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Sigma: A7906, 
minimum BSA content: 98%) 
 
SDS-PAGE 
 
SDS-PAGE was performed with a ready-to-use electrophoresis system equipped with 4-20% 
gradient gels (precast, Mercury PerfectPAGE SDS, catalogue number 5300.41212, Continental 
Lab Products, San Diego, CA, USA) under standard conditions.  Markers were from BioRad 
(Hercules, CA, USA, product name: Precision Plus Protein Standards). Laemmli sample buffer 
was from Biorad (catalogue number 161.0737) and 1:20 (V:V) β-mercaptoethanol (MP 
Biomedicals Inc., Uden, the Netherlands, catalogue number 194834) was added prior to use.  
Gels were stained with Coomassie Briljant Blue (Acros Organics, Landsmeer, the Netherlands, 
catalogue number 191490250, 0.1% in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol), and destained with 
10% acetic acid and 40% methanol.  Gels were scanned with a HP Photosmart 3110 scanner, 
using HP Solution Center software. 
  
A reference sample of purified parvalbumin obtained from FARRP and its preparation has been 
described in Section I of this report. 
 
General extraction procedure
 
Fish and maw samples were ground using a kitchen-scale blender and if necessary with a 
professional blender (Super Total Nutrition Center, stainless steel, Whole food machine®, Vita-
mix Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).  Ground samples were stored frozen.  Extracts were prepared 
by stirring 1 part of ground fish or maw sample with 4 parts of extraction buffer for 2 hours at 
room temperature.  Suspensions were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm in sterile 50 ml 
PP-test tubes, Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL, USA, catalogue reference Cellstar® 227261).  
For exploratory extracts, supernatants were taken and analyzed directely.  Production extracts 
were filtered over 0.22 µm bottle-top filters (500 ml filter system 0.22µm PES (polyethersulfone) 
sterilizing, low protein binding membrane, non pyrogenic (Corning Inc., Acton, MA, USA). 
After filtration, extracts were subdivided into 1 ml aliquots (2 ml polypropylene cryo vials, 
12,5/48 mm, sterile and pyrogen-free vials with screw cap, Greiner bio-one catalogue number 
121263).  Filtration and subdividing was done in a flow chamber.

 C.  Results & Discussion:  
 
Comparison of extraction buffers – SDS-PAGE results 
Three extraction buffers with neutral pH, with or without physiological concentration of salt, 
were used to investigate the extractability of protein from fish flesh and maw samples. In order 
to test the protein composition in a qualitative way, SDS-PAGE analysis was performed for all 
extracts.  Figure 3.1 and 3.2 (panels distributed over different pages) show the results for fish 
flesh and maws respectively.

Figure 3.2. SDS-PAGE results of maw extracts 
Samples J52/04 and FL17/18/05 (Panel A, previous page), samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 (Panel B, previous 
page), and samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 (Panel C, this page) were extracted with different extraction fluids and 
analyzed on SDS-PAGE (4-20% gels stained with Coomassie Briliant Blue).  Molecular weights of markers are 
indicated next the marker lanes (kDa). 
 
 
All fish flesh samples (Figure 3.1), except F 21/05 show a band pattern very similar to each other 
and very similar to that of cod fish, (sample from a local supermarket).  A triplet between 
approximately 37 and 50 kDa is clearly visible, as well as bands at approximately 60 and 100 
kDa.  A faint triplet at approximately 30 kDa is visible in all samples (except for F 21/05) as 
well.  Also, a band at approximately 12 kDa is clearly visible in all fish samples, including F 
21/05.  This band is most likely parvalbumin (based on MW and band assignment described in 
the relevant literature.  The staining of the gel depicted in Figure 3.1A is less clear, for unknown 
reason, and the parvalbumin is therefore less clearly visible.  The control sample of cod fish on 
this gel shows the same phenomenon, indicating the that this is indeed a gel (staining) artifact, 
rather than a difference in band pattern as compared to the other fish samples investigated 
(Figures 1B and 1C).  It should be noted that the fish sample F 21/05 arrived in a non-frozen 
condition at PodiCeps premises, covered with mold.  Although the fish flesh was prepared as 
best as possible under these conditions, the different SDS-PAGE pattern may well be explained 
by this.  
 
Water, PBS, and 0.9% NaCl gave similar results for extracts of fish flesh (similar band pattern, 
similar band intensity).  Extracts prepared with SDS-PAGE sample buffer showed more intense 
bands.

For maws, quite another picture emerges.  As shown in Figure 2 (panels A, B, and C), all 
samples of maws have a band pattern different to that of cod flesh which was used as a control.  
A set of bands at approximately 150 kDa, and a (sometimes) vague band at around 50 kDa is 
present in all maw samples.  There are some individual differences as well.  For example, 
samples FA 1/2/05 and FA 13/05 show protein bands at approximately 20 kDa.  
 
A noteworthy difference occurred in maw extracts prepared with salt versus without salt.  The 
overall intensity of proteins bands was higher for all maw samples (except for FL 17/18/05) in 
extracts prepared with physiological salt concentration.  More specifically, the protein band at 
approximately 150 kDa was not present or was barely visible in extracts prepared without salt. 
There are some additional differences between extracts with or without salt, varying for each 
species.  When SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used for extraction, the overall intensity of 
staining was much higher.  Furthermore, an additional band at approximately 20 kDa was found 
in all samples.  Sample J52/04 had the lowest intensity of this band.  It is unlikely that this band 
is parvalbumin for two reasons.  First, the molecular weight is different.  Second, parvalbumin is 
water/salt extractable by definition.  It cannot be excluded, though, that parvalbumin is present in 
the maw extracts based on this SDS-PAGE analysis even though no noteworthy bands were 
visible in the 12kDa region. 
 
Qualitative analysis (Bradford)
 
The protein concentration of all fish flesh and fish maw extracts was determined using Bradford 
analysis (Table 3.2).

For fish flesh extracts, minor differences in protein concentration were found between the 
various extraction buffers.  Only sample F 21/05 shows a substantially lower protein 
concentration.  This is the sample that arrived at Podiceps in non-frozen, mold covered Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

condition. For the other samples,  the protein concentration ranges from approximately 2.2 to 4.4 
mg/ml. More noteworthy differences in protein concentrations were found for extracts made 
from the flesh of the different fish species.  
 
For fish maw extracts, lower protein concentrations were found.  Differences in protein 
concentration were found in comparisons between the different extraction buffers.  Differences 
were also noted in the protein concentrations prepared from maws of different species.  In fact, 
extracts prepared in the absence of physiological concentrations of salt show a much lower 
protein concentration as compared to extracts prepared with salt.  These data are in line with the 
results of the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2A, B, and C).  
 
Selection of extraction buffer
 
The choice of extraction buffer (water, 0.9% NaCl, and PBS) had little effect on the protein band 
pattern encountered with SDS-PAGE and the protein yield as determined by the Bradford assay 
for fish flesh.  However, for the maw extracts, a substantially higher yield and a richer band 
pattern was obtained when extracts were prepared in the presence of physiological 
concentrations of salt.  
 
SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used to prepare extracts as controls.  Due to the presence of the 
detergent SDS and the reducing agent DTT, protein extraction becomes more efficient, resulting 
in higher yields and additional proteins that get solubilized.  However, the nature of this buffer 
makes it not suitable for the skin testing aspects of this investigation (results not yet available). 
 
The decision was made to select PBS as the extraction buffer and to exclude fish sample F 21/05 
from production of skin test extracts.  The production of skin test extracts will be described later 
in conjuction with the results of the skin test trials. 
 
The extracts described in this section of the report were subsequently used with the cod 
parvalbumin ELISA to assess the parvalbumin content of the fish flesh and maw samples used in 
the manufacturing of isinglass (see Section V below).

A. Introduction: 
Western blotting of the rabbit anti-codfish parvalbumin antibody against fish flesh and maws 
was carried out in order to ascertain which band(s) in fish flesh and maws would be recognized 
by the antisera.

B. Materials and Methods: 
 
SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by electroblotting according 
to the method of Towbin et al. (1979). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with 
affinity purified anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies. Bound anti-cod parvalbumin IgG was detected 
with peroxidase-labelled goat-anti-rabbit-IgG antibodies using the DAB staining method.  
  
 C.  Results & Discussion: 
The Westen blot indicates that all fish muscle extracts reacted with affinity-purified antibodies 
against cod parvalbumin, with some differences in reactivity (Figure 4, upper panel).  Maws 
were analyzed as well (Figure 4, lower panel).  In maws, the parvalbumin was only vaguely 
visible for F21/05 and other extracts did not show any reacting parvalbumin.  While parvalbumin 
seems present in fish muscle on the basis of Western blots, parvalbumin was not detected using 
the same antibodies in the ELISA (see following section).  This may be explained by the fact that 
epitopes are under native condition in the ELISA and not as readily accessible to the anti-
parvalbumin antibodies.

V. ELISA for Detecting Cod Parvalbumin

A.  Introduction: 
 
With the production of purified cod parvalbumin (see Section I) and anti-cod parvalbumin 
antisera (see Section II), the development of an ELISA for cod parvalbumin was possible.  
Although the existing ELISAs using anti-frog and anti-carp parvalbumin monoclonal antibodies 
seemed reasonably good, the cod parvalbumin ELISA was developed because an ELISA based 
upon polyclonal antisera might have broader specificity to detect parvalbumins from a wider 
range of species. 
 
B. Methods & Materials 
 
Inhibition ELISA
 
An indirect ELISA utilizing the rabbit anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies was initially developed. 
The antibodies were purified using Protein G (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) before 
use. Using the indirect ELISA in a quantitative determination, a cod extract was analyzed for cod 
parvalbumin content. The extract contained 0.3 ± 0.2 mg/ml cod parvalbumin, in line with an 
average protein concentration of 2-3 mg/ml. However, further development and testing of the 
inhibition ELISA was abrogated because it was found that a sandwich-type format ELISA was 
more suitable for quantification of analyte concentrations close to the detection limit. 
 
Sandwich ELISA
 
All sandwich ELISA experiments were performed with a capture antibody of Protein G-purified 
rabbit anti-parvalbumin antibody (1 µg/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified rabbit 
anti-parvalbumin antibody (500 fold diluted) as the detector antibody. Blocking of remaining 
sites on the microtiter plate was done with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) 
containing 3% BSA. The incubation buffer was PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20 
and the washing buffer consisted of PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20.

The commercial manufacturers of isinglass (study sponsors) provided samples of fish muscle 
tissue and fish maws (common name for swim bladders). 
 
C. Results: 
 
Specificity of the Cod Parvalbumin ELISA
 
The substances shown in Table 5.1 were used for cross-reactivity testing. Samples were from a 
Dutch supermarket except for peanut, corn, soy flour and wheat flour which were obtained from 
food ingredient suppliers. Extracts were made by mixing 1 part of (ground, if necessary) sample 
plus 5 parts of extraction buffer (PBS) for two hours at room temperature, then clarified using 
centrifugation (15 minutes at 4 °C, 4000 rpm).

Figure 5.1 shows the reactivity of the tested samples, at different dilutions starting at  
10-fold up to 21,870-fold (measured in duplicate). In each experiment a standard curve of 
parvalbumin was measured in triplicate. Background signals were between 0.09 and 0.14. 
Background signals were not subtracted from measured signals in the presented figures. The 
maximal signals at plateau varied between approximately 1.2 and 2.3, due to some variability in

The data from Figure 5.1 show that the cross-reactivity of all tested samples is low, even at low 
dilutions. Shrimp is the most reactive substance, at a dilution of 30 fold. The measured response 
is comparable of a dilution of 312,500-fold of cod, so in the order of 10,000 fold less.  
 
Recovery of Cod Parvalbumin from Isinglass
 
Beer, wine, fish gelatin, and isinglass were spiked with purified cod parvalbumin by diluting a 
calibration curve in a 10-fold diluted matrix extract. Figure 3.2 shows the results. The plateau 
heights differ per experiment due to variations in substrate color reaction.

The data in Figure 5.2 show that isinglass does not inhibit the reactivity of parvalbumin in the 
sandwich ELISA substantially. Therefore, traces of potentially present parvalbumin should not 
be hindered from recognition by the matrix.  The matrix with most interference is isinglass.  At 
half-maximal reactivity (absorbance approximately 0.35), the difference in reactivity of 
parvalbumin in a 10-fold diluted isinglass extract is estimated to be 2 to 4-fold.  This should be 
considered when measuring the parvalbmin content in samples of isinglass that are diluted only 
10-fold. 
 
Reactivity of extracts of fish and maw in sandwich ELISA
 
Extracts of fish and maw samples were prepared and tested in several dilutions in duplicate.

The majority of the samples did not react substantially.  In the fish extracts, parvalbumin was 
present based on SDS-PAGE patterns and immunoblotting with anti-cod parvalbumin antisera  .  
It was expected that the fish samples would be more reactive than the maw samples, but the 
contrary was observed.  Maw samples F21/05 and FL13/04 were most reactive. For F21/05 there 
was no usable fish extract (sample arrived moldy), and fish extract FL13/04 shows a lower 
response than maw sample FL13/04.  Of the fish samples, FA 13/05 is most reactive; again no 
dose dependence is observed and the maximum signal is far lower than that of purified 
parvalbumin. 
 
Even although the data show that the tested samples do not react substantially, data from Figure 
3.2 were calculated using the calibration curve of purified cod parvalbumin. Limit of 
quantification is 0.2 ug/g (ppm). Table 5.2 shows the results of the analysis of fish and fish maw 
samples for parvalbumin using the cod parvalbumin antiserum.

* Results based on the assumption that all soluble parvalbumin is extracted and has comparable 
immunoreactivity as cod parvalbumin. 
 
All of the tested fish species extracts have parvalbumin, based on SDS-PAGE and 
immunoblotting.  However, with the exception of cod, these fish extracts do not react in the 
ELISA.  While some of the maw samples gave weak positive results in this parvalbumin ELISA, 
these preliminary results are of only limited value.  It may be that the extraction procedure does 
not recover 100% of the parvalbumin, but it was clearly shown that a 12 kDa band was present 
in the extracts, comparable to extraction in the presence of SDS in the SDS-PAGE studies.  
Thus, incomplete recovery cannot explain the lack of reactivity of the extracts in the sandwich 
ELISA for cod parvalbumin.

Analysis of 11 samples of fish isinglass 
Eleven samples of isinglass were analyzed with the sandwich ELISA for cod parvalbumin.  
Table 5.3 shows the results.  
 
It is important to note that the fish species tested within the framework of this project (except 
cod) do not react substantially in the cod parvalbumin ELISA, even although there is evidence 
for the presence of parvalbumin, based on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting results.

Table 5.3 shows that low levels of parvalbumin are detectable in isinglass samples.  Dilutions of 
isinglass were not parallel with dilutions of cod parvalbumin, and true quantification therefore is 
not possible. The non-parallelism is illustrated by the high standard deviation (same order of 
magnitude as response), and by the increasing calculated value for higher diluted extracts (data 
not shown here).  The non-parallelism may be caused by differences in the affinity of cod 
parvalbumin and parvalbumin of other fishes to the anti-cod parvalbumin antibodies.  
Differences between isinglass samples are apparent.  These may be explained by differences in 
parvalbumin content, but due to the issues mentioned above, this is not conclusive.  It should 
furthermore be taken into consideration that isinglass matrix inhibits the signal of cod 
parvalbumin slightly (2 to 4 fold). Food Allergy Research and Resource Program  Study No. FARRP-08-2006

 D.  Discussion: 
 
A sandwich ELISA was successfully developed for detection of cod parvalbumin using anti-cod 
parvalbumin polyclonal antisera.  The ELISA is specific for parvalbumin and does not 
substantially cross-react with common food ingredients. The ELISA could detect cod 
parvalbumin spiked into isinglass.  The sensitivity of the cod parvalbumin ELISA at 0.20 µg/g is 
excellent and equivalent or superior to commercial ELISAs for peanut, gluten, and β-
lactoglobulin.  These results suggested that the sandwich ELISA could be used for measuring 
residual parvalbumin in isinglass and in  other food matrices. Furthermore, purified parvalbumin 
spiked into beer and wine is not substantially inhibited.  However, some decrease of parvalbumin 
reactivity was observed when purified parvalbumin was spiked into isinglass.  
 
Although the tested fish flesh samples display a 12 kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE that is 
reactive with the anti-cod parvalbumin antiserum (see Figure 4.1), attempts to absolutely 
quantitate the level of parvalbumin in extracts of the muscle tissues and maws of fish species 
used to manufacture isinglass by ELISA were not successful.  Five of 6 maws did not react 
either; in one of the maws, some reactivity was found.  As noted above, several possible reasons 
exist for these unexpected results.  One possibility is the the specificity of the polyclonal anti-
cod parvalbumin antiserum is not suitable for the detection of parvalbumin in the muscles or 
maws of these particular species.  However, further research might well allow use of this 
antiserum or some combination of this antiserum with the anti-carp and anti-frog parvalbumin 
monoclonal antibodies described elsewhere (see FARRP-07-2006)  for the development of an 
ELISA that would be reliable for detection of parvalbumin in these muscle and maw extracts.  
This research group simply ran out of time to solve this technical problem in meeting the EFSA 
deadline for submission of data.  Certainly, it would be premature to conclude that these fish and 
maw samples have low or no parvalbumin. 
 
Curiously, parvalbumin could be detected at low levels in isinglass samples even though it could 
not be detected in extracts of muscle or maws of the species of fish used to prepare the isinglass.  
The reasons for this result are not clear.  The quantitative estimation of parvalbumin levels in 
isinglass is not reliable based upon the problems with the current anti-cod fish parvalbumin 
ELISA method.  However, the levels of residual parvalbumin in isinglass are definitely quite 
low, although it is impossible to indicate exactly how low.  As noted previously, because of the 
water solubility of parvalbumins, the expectation would be that the parvalbumin is removed from 
isinglass during the washing steps of the isinglass-manufacturing process.  However, fish 
collagen is used commercially for its ability to entrap and remove materials including proteins 
from alcoholic beverages.  Thus, it is not surprising that low levels of parvalbumin might remain 
despite extensive washing.

Executive Summary 
 
Traditionally, many types of beer are clarified (fined) by the addition of isinglass, which is a 
pure form of fish collagen. The isinglass combines with proteins and yeast in suspension in 
the beer, causing the formation of large flocs which sediment out of the beer. In some 
beers these flocs are removed in the brewery by filtration of centrifugation. Such beers are 
described as brewery-conditione d beers. However, in some beer styles (known as cask-
conditioned beers) the flocs ar e not removed but form a compact sediment at the bottom 
of the container (the cask). Only the beer above this sediment is marketable. 
 
A method has been developed wher eby residual isinglass presen t in fined beers can be 
concentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The separated 
isinglass can then be hydrolysed to its consti tuent acids and quantifie d by measuring the 
content of hydroxyproli ne, which is an imino acid present in significant quantities only in 
animal collagens. The limit of quant ification of this method, t hat is the concentration of 
isinglass in beer which can be distinguished fr om background levels of hydroxyproline, is 
0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry weight basis).  
 
This method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which could 
be present in brewery- and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine whether there is 
likely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn from a position close to 
the bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be marketable, could nevertheless contain 
significantly higher concentrations of isinglass.  
 
The results indicate that residues in many bottled and canned beers fine d with isinglass in 
the brewery are below t he limit of quantificati on of the method. Wher e isinglass could be 
quantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed 1mg/litre. 
 
For large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were on ly slightly higher. 
Residues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional samples could 
contain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beer s, the highest concentration of isinglass 
found did not exceed 5 mg/litre. 
 
There was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The 
concentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above the 
level of sedimented material) was marginally  higher than in the bulk, but still below 5 
mg/litre.

Introduction and Background 
 
Isinglass is used as a clarif ying (fining) agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage 
(typically 15 mg/litre; total range 10 - 70 mg/ litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it 
reacts with yeast and proteins, forming large flo cs. These flocs are removed from the bulk 
of the liquid by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Thus practically all the isinglass is 
removed and the product as presented to the c onsumer contains only small quantities of 
residues.  
 
Although isinglass has been widely used as a clarifying agent for centuries, extensive 
searches of the scientific and medical litera ture have not identified any documented cases 
of allergy due to the isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of allergic reactions 
to isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all, is extremely rare.  
 
New, comprehensive studies into the potential allergenicity of  isinglass have been carried 
out and are reported elsewhere in this dossier. The potential for allergenic reactions to 
occur is also influenced by the amount of residues consumed. Little robust data is 
available in the lit erature relating to the concentrations of isinglass which remain in fined 
beers.  This section of the dossier therefore reports on st udies carried out in order to 
quantify more precisely the amount of isinglass present in typical fined beers and also to 
define the maximum range of residue levels whic h could remain in t he beer in a worst 
case.  
 
 
Experimental approaches 
 
Analysis of residues 
The measurement of isinglas s residues in beer is complicated by three factors in 
particular; 
• The concentration of residues is expected to be low, so one or more concentration 
steps would be required 
• Isinglass is a protein; beer contains several other proteins  in addition to isinglass, 
and these are present in much larger quantities, making  identification and 
separation difficult 
• The isinglass residues may include fragments,  making it difficult to separate or 
identify them using methods based on molecular weight.  
 
In the current study, it was decided that th e best approach would be to use an antibody 
raised against isinglass. This would not only introduce specificity and provide a valuable 
concentration step, but should also allow for the detection of more of the smaller fragments 
of isinglass which might not be precipitated by ammonium sulphate alone.   
 
The antibody would be used to collect and c oncentrate the isinglass residues from a 
sample of beer.  In order to quantify these residues use was made of the unusual amino 
acid content of isinglass. Isinglass is a pu re form of collagen, which is characterised by 
presence of hydroxyproline. This  imino acid is rare in other  proteins but is key to the 
structure and functionality of isinglass. The hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline stabilises the 
helical structure of collagen thro ugh the formation of H bonds (Moir et al, 1984). As there 
is no other source of collagen in the bre wing process, and since hydroxyproline is not 
                                                            Page        of   17 5Appendix 3 
present in significant quantit ies in proteins other than collagen, measurement of 
hydroxyproline in the hydrolyse d residues provides a specific  means of quantification of 
isinglass. 
 
Cask-conditioned beers 
For the overwhelming majority (over 90%) of  fined beers, whether destined for canning, 
bottling or draught, isinglass residues are removed in the brewery by filtration or 
centrifugation. Cask-conditio ned beer, however, (often described as “real ale”) is a 
traditional style of be er and is unique to the UK. It r epresents an important traditional 
product, but is a niche market, and sales have continued to decline, from almost 17% of 
UK beer sales in 1980 to 6.6% in 2004 (British Beer and Pub Assoc. 2005).

Nevertheless, consumers of cask ales tend to be loyal to this product type, and could 
drink, on average, around 12 pint s (6.8 litres) per week. T he typical cask ale consumer 
tends to be in the 35+ age gr oup (Table 1) with a high fr equency-low volume consumption 
pattern rather than the low frequency-high volume pattern which is more common amongst 
younger consumers.

In cask-conditioned beer, the yeast remains in the cask, and promotes flavour changes 
that contribute to the essential character of the final product. Is inglass is dosed either into 
the beer before filling or directly into the cask, at a rate of, typically, 50 mg/litre. The action 
of isinglass takes place gener ally within the first 3 to 4 hours after filling so that the 
flocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) rapidly settle to the base of the cask, 
forming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from the cask to a point above the 
sediment. For this style of beer, the beer serv ed must be bright (i.e. no cloudiness) and be 
free of suspended particles. Clo udy beer is not acceptable to  the consumer. In order to 
facilitate the dispense of clear beer, and to  avoid drawing on the sedimented material, 
there is a gap between the bottom of the cask and the position of the tap. This means that 
a certain volume of beer, generally around 2 litres, is not dispensed. This, which is known 
as the ullage, contains the sedimented material, together wit h the overwhelming majority 
of the isinglass. However, it is theoretically possible that t here could be some stratification 
of isinglass residues within the bulk of the ca sk, with lower layers of dispensable beer 
potentially containing more isinglass than t he higher levels. This possibility has been 
investigated in order to establish what the “worst case” expo sure might be for the 
consumer.

Materials and Methods 
 
Preparation and testing of the Antibody 
Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by the specialist company Biogenesis UK. The 
immunogens were commercial samples of pure isinglass (both powder and paste) 
                                                            Page        of   17 7Appendix 3 
provided by the major suppliers of commercial isinglass. Although processing details may 
vary between manufacturers, all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from 
the same limited range of tropical fish. Thus the isinglass samples used are expected to be 
representative of those marketed for fining beer. The antibodies pr ovided required some 
initial purification prior to use.  Serum was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C 
using a Beckman centrifuge.  The supernat ant was carefully poured off and the pellet 
discarded.  Ammonium sulphate was slowly added to the supernatant to achieve a final 
concentration of 30% (saturation), and then sti rred for 30 minutes at room temperature to 
encourage precipitation of IgG.  The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes 
at 4°C, then the supernatant was carefully re moved and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml 
of 0.9% saline (w/v).  The ammonium sulphate precipitation procedure was repeated for a 
second time and the resulting pellet was re -suspended in 0.9% salin e.  The purified 
antibody solution was dialysed overnight in  phosphate buffered saline, using dialysis 
tubing with a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cut-off.   The antibody solution was stored in the 
fridge in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide until required. 
 
The purified antibodies were tested against the immunogen usin g an ELISA protocol. The 
ELISA plates were coated with 1 µg of isinglass, using 200 μl of a solution of isinglass per 
well. Serial dilutions (10 fo ld) of the pre-immune and imm une sera were prepared at the 
same time. The antisera were in cubated in the treated wells at 37 oC for 30 minutes. The 
reaction was visualised with an alkaline ph osphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and 
para-nitrophenol phosphate at 405 nm.

Separation of isinglass residues from beer 
The control beer used for method developm ent was a BRi standar d beer, prepared in the 
BRi pilot brewery without the use of isinglass.  
 
Beer was degassed overnight at room temperature. The pH of  the beer was adjusted to 
7.0, using a magnetic stirrer with drop-wise addition of 3M NaOH, allowing any precipitated 
materials to re-dissolve.  It was important that this was done slow ly and that the pH-
adjusted beer should still be bright. 
 
Antibody (200μl) was added to 100 ml of beer and the mixture was stirred gently at room 
temperature for 30 minutes. The antibody-ant igen complex was then precipitated using 
ammonium sulphate added to 30% saturation.   Again the ammonium sulphate was added 
slowly with constant gently stirring. (30% saturation required 17.6 g of ammonium sulphate 
per 100 ml of beer). The beer/ammonium sulphate mixture, wit h precipitated materials, 
was stirred for a further 30 minutes. 
 
The precipitate containing the antibody-isinglass complex was then collected by 
centrifugation (6500 rpm for 20 minutes) using round bottom centrifuge bottles.  The 
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re -dissolved in 16 ml of 20 mM phosphate 
buffer pH 7, with vortexing. 
 
The re-dissolved antibody-isinglass complex was then dialysed against deionised water 
using Spectropore CE dialysis tubing. This dialysis tubing has a molecular weight cut off of 
3.5 kDa (equivalent to approxim ately 25-30 amino acid residu es).  Dialysis was for 20 
hours with three changes of water. The liquid wa s transferred from the dialysis tubing into 
round bottom flasks and frozen in solid carbon dioxide.  The samples were then reduced to 
dryness in a lyophiliser (usually 48 hours). Hydroxyproline content was then determined on 
these samples. 
 
Hydrolysis of residues to constituent amino acids and derivatisation.  
Test samples were reconstituted and hydrol ysed to their constituent amino acids using 
HCl. Two ml of 50% HCl was added to the r ound bottom flask to dissolve the sample 
which was then transferred to a 4 ml vial and the flask was rinsed with a further 2 ml of HCl 
which was also added to the vial. The seal ed vial was then heated for 4 hr at 100 °C then 
allowed to cool prior to derivatisation. 
 
Hydroxyproline and other amino acids in the hydrolysate we re derivatised and quantified 
were using a Phenomenex EZ:faast™ kit, accordi ng to the manufacturer’s instructions. In 
some cases the identity of the reagents was not  disclosed, the name used here is that 
provided by the kit manufacturers.   
Eluting Medium, Reagent 3, ( 200 µl) was added to 100 µl of hydrolysate, 95 µl KOH (400 
mg/ml) and 100 µl of Internal Standard (R eagent 1). After thorough mixing, 50 µl of 
Reagent 4 was added to the preparation vial. 
 
The mixture was emulsified by vortexing for 15 seconds and then allo wed to stand for at 
least 1 minute. During this period the amino acids were converted to derivatives which 
were more volatile than the original acids. 
 
                                                            Page        of   17 9Appendix 3 
The mixture was re-emulsified by vortexing for at least 15 seconds and again allowed to 
separate over a period of 1 minute.  Reagent 5 (50 µl) was then added to the mixture, 
which was vortexed for 15 seconds and allo wed to stand for 1 minute.  After phase 
separation, 400 µl of hexane was added to the vial. 
 
The upper, organic layer was removed to a cl ean vial and gently evaporated to near-
dryness under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The residue was then re-dissolved in 100 µl of 
Tri-Sil TBT.  After 20 minutes , 500 µL of hexane was added to the vial followed by 500 µl 
of water.  The upper, organic layer was removed to a vial for GC-MS analysis. 
 
 
Quantification of Hydroxyproline 
Derivatised hydroxyproline was separated and quantified by gas chromatography with 
mass spectrophotometric detection. The GC -MS was fitted with a Phenomenex ZB-50 
column and operated in selected ion m onitoring mode. The quant ification ion for 
hydroxyproline was m/z 244,  with 158 and 142 as qualifier ions. Identification was 
confirmed from retention times and by matchi ng the qualifier ion rati os with those of the 
authentic compound.  Norvaline was used as the internal standard.  
 
Quantification was carried out using standard curves prepared by derivatisation of 
solutions of hydroxyproline over the range 0 - 200 nanomoles/ml. The limit of detection, 
defined as three times the signal  to noise ratio for a reagent blank, for hydroxyproline on 
the GC-MS was 40 picomoles/ml or 10 picogr ams injected. Allowing for the concentration 
of the beer during prepar ation of the samples, this corresp onds to a limit of detection of 
approximately 1 µg/litre of hydroxyproline in the beer. The limit of quantification for 
hydroxyproline in beer is approx imately three times the limit of detection, i.e. 3 µg/litre.

Correlation of hydroxyproline with isinglass  
The values obtained from the GC-MS anal ysis were in terms of nanomoles of 
hydroxyproline. These had then to be converted to weights of isingl ass. A calibration was 
developed by hydrolyzing know n concentrations of isingl ass and analyzing them for 
hydroxyproline as described above (see Figure 5). 
 
 
 
Recovery 
The recovery of isinglass from beer was esti mated by adding a known weight of isinglass 
to beer produced in BRi’s pilot brewery without the use of isinglass, then analyzing aliquots 
using the antibody procedure as previously de scribed. At an addition rate of 2.26 mg 
isinglass (dry basis) / 100ml beer, the recovery ranged from 87 – 91.5%.

Survey of commercial small pack beers 
Bottled and canned commercial beers were purchased in the UK in 2004/2005. Brands 
were chosen to include: 
• Different beer styles (lagers, ales, stouts) 
• Large national / international and small regional producers 
• Pack type (cans and bottles) 
• Beer known to be produced without isingl ass (produced in BRi’s pilot brewery) as 
well as brands known to be fined with isinglass  
 
Cask-conditioned beer 
A commercial brand of ale know n to use a high isinglass do se rate (72 mg/litre) was 
selected.  A cask was obtained  from commercial wholesal er, set up in the BRi beer 
dispense cellar at 12 °C, and allowed to settle for 3 days, as would be usual in commercial 
practice.  
The sampling protocol was designed to simulate a situation in a retail outlet in which beer 
is supplied to customers intermittently over several days. A 1 litre sample was taken via 
the tap and retained for analysis.  The next day several litres were drawn off and a further 
sample taken for analysis. This was repeated over the next week until the cask was almost 
empty and the beer sample was unaccept ably cloudy and would not have been 
marketable. This sample represents the beginnings of the ullage.  
 
In addition, single samples were taken of a number of other brands of  cask ale. In these 
cases the samples were taken when the casks were approximately half empty.  
 
Keg beer 
A keg containing an international brand of brewery-conditioned beer was set up in the BRi 
cellar and sampled as described for the ca sk-conditioned ale, except that, since 
sedimented material had been removed by filt ration in the brewery, the bottom samples 
remained clear and marketable.

Background levels of hydroxyproline in beer 
In order to establish the backg round levels, if any, of hydr oxyproline in beer, control beers 
were prepared in the BRI pilo t brewery without using any is inglass. A total of eight 
samples, from 3 replicate all-malt brews, were taken and analysed for hydroxyproline 
using the antibody technique described. A mean concentration of 0.009 mg/litre of 
hydroxyproline was detected in the isingla ss free control beer. This background level, 
which corresponds to 0.17 mg/litre of isinglass,  was taken as the limit  of quantification of 
isinglass in beer.

Table 2 lists the results for 13 commercial pa ckaged beers, including 8 ales which were 
known to be clarified in the brewery using is inglass. Hydroxyproline could be detected in 
all of the samples except for three ales. When this was converted to isinglass equivalents, 
                                                            Page        of   17 13Appendix 3 
it can be seen that all the la gers and one of the stout samples were below the limit of 
quantification for isinglass. Al though there was some variatio n between different samples, 
all contained less than 1 mg isinglass per litre of beer.

Table 3 shows the concentration  of isinglass residues found in  a brewery-conditioned keg 
beer dispensed over a period of time. Concent rations were slightly higher than in small-
pack beers, but the highest concentration found was below 3 mg/litre, with a mean of 1.0 
mg/litre. Although there was some variation in  isinglass concentrations, there was no 
evidence of any stratification of residues wit hin the keg and there was no accumulation of 
isinglass residues at the bottom of the keg.

Table 4 shows the concentration of isingl ass residues found in a cask-conditioned ale 
dispensed over a period of time. Within the bulk of the cask (t hat is, the beer which would 
be served to the customer) isinglass residues remained below 3 mg/ litre, with a mean of 
1.8 mg/litre and no evidence of stratification. The last sample which was drawn was 
noticeably hazy to the naked eye, and this cont ained a higher concentration of isinglass, 
                                                            Page        of   17 14Appendix 3 
3.6 mg/litre. Samples drawn fr om below this point represen ted the ullage, and contained 
visible yeast and protein clumps. The concentrati on of isinglass at this level was very high 
(> 100 mg/litre) but since it was associated with the solid material, the distribution was 
non-homogeneous and difficult to determine with any accuracy. 
 
Samples were also taken from a number of other brands of cask al e, including one micro-
brewery brand, and tested for isinglass residues. These were taken from casks 
approximately half empty. Results are shown in Table 5.

Concentrations of isinglass in these 7 brands were similar to those found in the 
stratification study, with the highest concentr ation found being 4.2 mg/litre. This suggests 
that the cask chosen for the st ratification study was representative of other brands of cask 
ale.  
 
Discussion  
 
The studies reported here indicate that the overwhelming majority of the isinglass added to 
beer as a fining agent is either removed in the brewery (for brewer y-conditioned beers) or 
is contained in the sediments at the botto m of the cask (for cask-conditioned beers). In 
each case, the concentrations of isingla ss contained in the beer marketed and consumed 
by the drinker are extremely low. Precise quantif ication of the resi dues which could be 
consumed is complicated by the presence of a wide range of other proteins, by the likely 
heterogeneous nature of the isinglass residues themselves an d by the fact that the levels 
are close to the limits of quantification. These complications have undoubtedly reduced the 
precision of the determinations.  
 
Only a few other attempts to quantify isingla ss residues in beer hav e been reported. One 
method has been developed in New Zealand, (Hofman & MacDonald, 2002). The details 
of this method are not publicly available, bu t it is understood to be based on the classic 
biochemical principles of prec ipitation of the prot ein by ammonium su lphate, followed by 
separation of the protein molecu les on the basis of size and el ectrical charge. Using this 
method, levels of isinglass residues in a small number of commercial beers from Australia 
and New Zealand (all brewery- conditioned brands) were found to be in the range 0.02 - 
0.16 mg/litre (Hofman et al, 2002) . These values are similar to those found in the current 
study for small-pack brewery conditioned lagers. They ar e lower than some of the 
brewery-conditioned ales tested,  but this is not surprising given the different brewing 
styles. In addition, any method based on molecu lar size runs the risk of missing fragments 
                                                            Page        of   17 15Appendix 3 
which may (but also may not) have the same or  similar allergenic potential to the parent 
molecule.  One advantage of th e antibody method used in the pr esent study is that both 
parent molecule and larger fragments should be detected.  
 
Other groups have also used hydroxyproline measurement as a means of detecting or 
quantifying isinglass (Leach, 1969; Chlup et al, 2006). The first of these (Leach, 1969) 
was a colorimetric test, and was qualitative only, since the amount of hydroxyproline 
present was too small to quantify with the techniques available at that time. It was used for 
determining whether or not a beer had been fined with isinglass. More recently a group at 
the Heriot-Watt University in Scotland also  used determination of hydroxyproline as a 
method of quantifying isinglass residues in beer (Chlup et al, 2006). This group, who were 
not using any concentration techniques, found that although hydr oxyproline could be 
detected in cask beers immediately after the fi nings were added, the levels fell to below 
the limit of detection once the beer had settled (typically  2 -3 days).   
 
As previously noted, hydroxypro line is generally considered to occur at significant levels 
only in animal collagen. Howeve r, there are published reports in  the scientific literature of 
glycoproteins containing hydr oxyproline in higher plants (Cleland, 1968; Stuart and 
Varner, 1980).The current study did detec t low levels of hydroxyproline in beer which had 
not been treated with finings. This has not been previously reported, probably because 
methods have not been sufficiently sensitive. If barley contained similar proteins, any 
fragments remaining in the beer would hav e been concentrated by  the extraction 
procedure used in the study repor ted here. Thus the background levels of hydroxyproline 
detected in unfined beer are a likely consequence of the low limit of detection of the 
method used.  
 
In the current study, cask beer was sampled on a daily basis, over a total time period of 
one week, with the final samples being drawn from close to the sedimented material, 
where they appeared visibly cloudy. In fact, the flavour of a cask beer will begin to 
deteriorate if it is not cons umed within 3-4 days after tapping. Thus in commercial practice 
casks may be replaced before a ll the marketable beer has been consumed. Thus the 
maximum concentrations detected in this study are likely to represent a “worst case” as far 
as dietary exposure for the consumer is concerned.  
 
Conclusions 
 
The results of the study reported here confirm that the concentration of residues remaining 
in beers fined with isinglass is indeed very low. For many bottled and canned beers, levels 
of isinglass are below the lim it of quantification.  Slightly higher concentrations may be 
found in beers in large containers such as  kegs and casks, but even here the maximum 
concentrations would be likely to remain bel ow 5 mg/litre. There is no evidence of 
significant stratification of isinglass resi dues in the marketable beer in such bulk 
containers.

Literature Search Report for Parvalbumin and Isinglass 
Allergenicity  
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The objective of this report is to outline a search strategy and identify pertinent scientific literature related 
to the allergenicity of parvalbumin or isinglass used in beer production. Intertek Health Sciences Inc. 
therefore conducted a comprehensive literature search using the electronic search tool ProQuest Dialog™ 
(ProQuest) on 20 June 2025. Details of the search strategy, including the inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
literature filtration, are provided in Section 2.0. The results of the literature search are provided in Section 
3.0. 
2.0 LITERATURE SEARCH METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Search Strategy 
The following databases were searched using ProQuest: Adis Clinical Trials Insight, AGRICOLA, AGRIS, 
Allied & Complementary Medicine™, BIOSIS® Toxicology, BIOSIS Previews®, CAB ABSTRACTS, Embase®, 
Foodline®: SCIENCE, FSTA®, MEDLINE®, NTIS: National Technical Information Service, ToxFile®, and 
Toxicology Abstracts.  
Keywords related to the test article (i.e., parvalbumin or isinglass) were searched in combination with 
keywords related to its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, wine, brew, alcohol). Results 
were further refined using keywords related to allergenicity including terms related to allergenicity, 
hypersensitivity, and anaphylaxis.  
For an article to be identified, at least 1 keyword from each of the relevant combined sets of keywords had 
to appear either in the title, abstract, or body of the text. The search terms and strategy are presented in 
Table 2.1-1 below.

2.2 Literature Filtration 
Once the search strategy was implemented and the publication titles were retrieved, the relevance of the 
publications was determined at 3 stages using the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the publications. At each 
stage, the exclusion criteria listed in Table 2.2-1 were applied to determine literature relevance. The 
3 stages of literature filtration are outlined below in greater detail. 
Stage 1: Titles of articles were reviewed, and abstracts of titles determined to be potentially relevant 
were retrieved. 
Stage 2:  Abstracts were reviewed, and full-length articles of abstracts determined to be potentially 
relevant were retrieved. 
Stage 3:  Full-length articles were reviewed, and those determined to meet any one of the exclusion 
criteria specified in Table 2.2-1 were excluded. 
Table 2.2-1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Used to Filter the Identified Literature 
Inclusion Criteria 
• The substance studied was relevant to parvalbumin or isinglass and its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages 
• The publication was a full-length article published in a peer-reviewed journal 
• The publication investigated allergenicity parameters 
Exclusion Criteria 
• The substance studied was not relevant to parvalbumin or isinglass and its use in the brewing of alcoholic beverages 
• The publication was a full-length article published in a non-peer-reviewed source (website, magazine, etc.) 
• The publication was published in abstract form only or as a short communication (conference abstract, letter to the editor, 
commentary, etc.) 
• The publication did not consider allergenicity parameters 
• The study was a duplicate record in the literature search 
• The full publication study report was not in English language 
3.0 LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTS 
As illustrated in Figure 3-1, the literature search resulted in the identification of 77 potentially relevant 
titles, and abstracts were retrieved for 17 of the records. Of the 17 abstracts, 12 were considered to be 
potentially relevant, and the full-length articles were retrieved. Of the full-length articles assessed, 2 met 
the exclusion criteria; therefore, 10 full-length studies were identified pertaining to the allergenicity of 
parvalbumin or isinglass used in beer production. A list of the 10 full-length studies identified as relevant to 
the allergenicity of isinglass or parvalbumin in the brewing of alcoholic beverages is presented in Table 3-1.

Investigation of the allergenic potential of wines fined with various proteinogenic fining agents by ELISA  
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 55.8 p.3127-3133 (Apr 18, 2007): p. 3127-3133. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Hidden allergens are a common problem in food safety that has been known for many years. This is why the European Parliament 
adopted Directive 2003/89/EC amending 2000/13/EC. In addition to specific ingredients, Directive 2003/89/EC also requests the 
declaration of specific products that were used in the production and could be a risk for allergic individuals. This also includes the 
declaration of fining agents and lysozyme used in wines. In fact, it could be assumed that fining agents would be almost 
completely removed during the manufacturing process; however, until now there has been no necessity to analyze wine for these 
fining agents. By applying enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), residuals of fining agent proteins and the stabilizer 
lysozyme were investigated in various German wines. The results showed no detectable amounts of fining agents in wines, except 
for dried egg white and lysozyme, both derived from hen's egg white. For those products, adverse reactions against treated wines 
could not be excluded.

Abstract (English):  
OBJECTIVE 
Recent Australian and international legislation requires labeling of wines made by using the potentially allergenic food proteins 
casein, milk, egg white, or isinglass (fish-derived) where “there is a detectable residual processing aid.” We investigated whether 
wines fined using these proteins or non-grape-derived tannins (tree-nut derived) can provoke significant clinical allergic reactions 
(anaphylaxis) in patients with confirmed immunoglobulin E-mediated relevant food allergy. 
 
METHODS 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine whether allergic reactions followed consumption of 
Australian commercial wines fined using one or more of the legislation-targeted food proteins. In addition, allergenicity of a larger 
panel of these wines was evaluated by blood basophil activation. 
 
RESULTS 
No anaphylaxis was induced by wine consumption. Three mild clinical reactions to protein-fined wine and two mild reactions to 
unfined wine occurred, but there was no statistically significant difference in reaction parameters between subject groups or 
between processing aids. No pattern of basophil activation correlated with wine type, processing aid, or subject group. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Wines fined with egg white, isinglass, or non-grape-derived tannins present an extremely low risk of anaphylaxis to fish-, egg-, or 
peanut-allergic consumers. Although consumption of milk protein-fined wine did not induce anaphylaxis, there were insufficient 
subjects to determine statistically whether wines fined with milk proteins present a risk to the very rare milk-allergic consumers. 
In summary, the observed lack of anaphylaxis and basophil activation induced by wines made using the legislation-targeted food 
proteins according to good manufacturing practice suggests negligible residual food allergens in these wines.  CONFIDENTIAL

Development of animal models and sandwich-ELISA tests to detect the allergenicity and antigenicity of fining agent residues in 
wines

Publication details: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 57.2 (Jan 28, 2009): 525-34. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Food allergy can cause food-related anaphylaxis. Food allergen labeling is the principal means of protecting sensitized individuals. 
This motivated European Directive 2003/89 on the labeling of ingredients or additives that could trigger adverse reactions, which 
has been in effect since 2005. During this study, we developed animal models with allergy to ovalbumin, caseinate, and isinglass 
in order to be able to detect fining agent residues that could induce anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. The second aim of 
the study was to design sandwich ELISA tests specific to each fining agent in order to detect their residue antigenicity, both during 
wine processing and in commercially available bottled wines. Sensitized mice and sandwich ELISA methods were established to 
test a vast panel of wines. The results showed that although they were positive to our highly sensitive sandwich-ELISA tests, some 
commercially available wines are not allergenic in sensitized mice. Commercially available bottled wines made using standardized 
processes, fining, maturation, and filtration, do not therefore represent any risk of anaphylactic reactions in sensitized mice. 
Allergenicity of wine containing processing aids: a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge

Universität München, Munich, Germany, Germany 
 
Publication details: Journal of Investigational Allergology & Clinical Immunology 19.3 (2009): 210-7. 
 
Abstract (English):  
BACKGROUND 
The European Union requires allergenic food ingredients to appear on labels in order to protect allergic consumers. 
 
OBJECTIVE 
To determine whether traces of egg-, milk-, and fish-derived processing aids used in winemaking might elicit clinical reactions in 
food-allergic patients. 
 
METHODS 
Five German wines were fined with a high dose of egg albumin, lysozyme, milk casein, fish gelatin, or isinglass, and filtered. 
Fourteen adults with allergy to egg (n = 5), milk (n = 5), or fish (n = 4) were included. Skin prick tests were performed with fining 
agents, and fined and unfined wines. All patients underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges with fined and 
unfined wines. 
 
RESULTS 
Skin prick tests were positive to hen's egg (n = 5), ovalbumin (n = 5), lysozyme (n = 4), cow's milk (n = 5), casein (n = 4), and cod 
(n = 3), but not to isinglass or fish gelatin (n = 0). Positive skin prick test results were observed for wines fined with albumin 
(n = 3), lysozyme (n = 2), casein (n = 1), gelatin (n = 0), and isinglass (n = 3), and for unfined wines (n = 1-2 in each patient group), 
with no significant differences between groups. Seventy-five percent of skin test-positive patients had specific immunoglobulin E 
to other allergens present in wine (eg, carbohydrates). The provocation test revealed no reactions to fined or unfined wines. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Although concentrated fining agents containing ovalbumin, lysozyme, and casein were allergenic in the skin prick test, no patient 
reacted adversely in the provocation test to fined wine. Wines treated with fining agents at commercial concentrations appear 
not to present a risk to allergic individuals when filtered.  CONFIDENTIAL

Allergenic potential of fining agent residues in German wines related to their dosage and an ordinary bentonite treatment  
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech 18.5 (2007): 22-24. 
 
Abstract (English):  
The effects of fining agent dosage (isinglass, potassium caseinate, dried egg white and gelatin derived from fish skin) and 
bentonite treatment on the amount of fining agent residues in German wines was studied. Fining agent proteins were measured 
by ELISA. Significant levels of fining agent residues were found neither in wines treated with an ordinary dosage nor in wines 
treated with an excess dosage of fining agents. Furthermore, significant levels of residues were found neither in wines with 
bentonite treatment nor in wines without bentonite treatment. 
Characterization, antigenicity and detection of fish gelatin and isinglass used as processing aid in wine 
 
Author: Weber, P; Steinhart, H; Paschke, A 
 
Publication details: Food Additives and Contaminants 27.3 (Mar 2010): 273-282. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Fish gelatin (FG) and isinglass (IG) are commonly used in the production of food and beverage products, as clarification aids or 
carriers for dyes, flavours and vitamins. There is a call for products processed with these fish-derived compounds to be labelled, 
for reasons of food safety (potential allergenicity), religious and ethical concerns and consumer protection. The aim of this study 
was to develop a reliable and sensitive method for the detection of FG and IG in foods. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against 
fish collagen and used to develop a sensitive indirect ELISA for the detection of FG and IG. Levels of less than 0.11 mcg/ml of FG 
and IG were detected and the method was successfully applied to the determination of FG and IG in wines. Wines, which had 
been processed with FG or IG and which had not been additionally treated with bentonite (for protein adsorption) and successive 
filtration, were found to have residues of up to 0.33 mcg/ml of FG and/of IG.

Abstract (English):  
BACKGROUND 
European legislators and wine producers still debate on the requirement for labeling of wines fined with potentially allergenic 
food proteins (casein, egg white or fish-derived isinglass). We investigated whether wines fined with known concentrations of 
these proteins have the potential to provoke clinical allergic reactions in relevant patients. 
 
METHODS 
In-house wines were produced for the study, fined with different concentrations of casein (n = 7), egg albumin (n = 1) and 
isinglass (n = 3). ELISA and PCR kits specific for the respective proteins were used to identify the fining agents. Skin prick tests and 
basophil activation tests were performed in patients with confirmed IgE-mediated relevant food allergies (n = 24). A wine 
consumption questionnaire and detailed history on possible reactions to wine was obtained in a multinational cohort of milk, egg 
or fish allergic patients (n = 53) and patients allergic to irrelevant foods as controls (n = 13). 
 
RESULTS 
Fining agents were not detectable in wines with the available laboratory methods. Nevertheless, positive skin prick test reactions 
and basophil activation to the relevant wines were observed in the majority of patients with allergy to milk, egg or fish, 
correlating with the concentration of the fining agent. Among patients consuming wine, reported reactions were few and mild 
and similar with the ones reported from the control group.  CONFIDENTIAL

CONCLUSION 
Casein, isinglass or egg, remaining in traces in wine after fining, present a very low risk for the respective food allergic consumers. 
Physician and patient awareness campaigns may be more suitable than generalized labeling to address this issue, as the latter 
may have negative impact on both non-allergic and allergic consumers. 
Parvalbumin in fish skin-derived gelatin: is there a risk for fish allergic consumers?

Abstract (summary):  
The major allergen parvalbumin was purified from cod muscle tissues, and polyclonal antibodies were raised towards it. The 
antibodies were tested for specificity and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using these antibodies. 
The ELISA was applied to measure parvalbumin in cod skin, the starting material for fish gelatin made from deep sea, wild fish. 
The ELISA was sufficiently sensitive (LLOQ = 0.8 ng ml (-1) in extracts, corresponding to 0.02 µg of parvalbumin per g of tissue), 
and did not cross-react with common food constituents. Fish gelatin, wine and beer, matrices for the potential use of this ELISA, 
did not cause disturbance of the assay performance. The data show that the parvalbumin content in cod muscle tissue is 6.25 mg 
g (-1), while the skins contained considerably less, 0.4 mg g (-1) Washing of the skins, a common industrial procedure during the 
manufacturing of fish gelatin, reduced the level of parvalbumin about 1000-fold to 0.5 µg g (-1), or 0.5 ppm. From 95 commercial 
lots of fish gelatin it is shown that 73 are below 0.02 µg g (-1) parvalbumin. From the other 22 lots, the one with the highest 
concentration contained 0.15 µg g (-1) of parvalbumin. These levels are generally assumed to be safe for fish-allergic individuals.

Abstract (English):  
Proteinaceous products are widely used as fining agents during winemaking to remove unwanted insoluble particles and 
undissolved microscopic particles (colloidal material) from the must or wine to improve stability. Some of them (egg white, 
caseinates, and fish gelatine) have allergenic potential and the presence of their residues in the final product could represent a 
risk for allergic individuals. Moreover, lysozyme (an egg allergen) is included among wine additives to control the fermentation 
processes and avoid spoiling during winemaking. The aim of this paper is to review the experimental/clinical data on the use of 
allergenic products in enology and the measurement of relative risk for sensitized subjects. In addition, methods developed 
specifically for the quantification of allergenic residues in must and wine are described.  CONFIDENTIAL

Allergic and intolerance reactions to wine  
 
Author: Wüthrich, B 1 1 Specialist for Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Specialist for Dermatology, Zollikerberg, Switzerland, 
Switzerland 
 
Publication details: Allergologie select 2.1 (Sep 1, 2018): 80-88. 
 
Abstract (English):  
Hypersensitivity reactions to alcoholic beverages (particularly red wine) are relatively frequent, affecting 10% of the general 
population. Hypersensitivity reactions due to alcoholic drinks, mainly in the form of airway reactions (rhinitis and asthma), occur 
significantly more frequently in persons with pre-existing rhinitis and asthma. In terms of pathogenesis, it has to be differentiated 
between immunologic, mainly IgE-mediated, hypersensitivity reactions (wine allergies), and intolerance reactions in which no 
causative allergen-specific immune mechanisms can be detected. Allergens responsible for wine allergy could be: grape (Vitis 
vinifera) proteins (particularly the major allergen lipid transfer protein Vit v1), proteins and ingredients used for the fining of 
wines such as fish gelatin or isinglass (swim bladder of the fish huso, family of sturgeons), ovalbumin, dairy (casein) products, gum 
arabic, enzymes (lysozyme, pectinase, glucanase, cellulase, glucosidase, urease, aromatic enzymes), molds (particularly Botrytis 
cinerea) responsible for the noble rot in wines, yeasts and proteins from insects that contaminated the mash. Type 1 allergic 
reactions (positive prick tests) have been described for inorganic components like ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and sulfites, 
but no specific IgE could be detected in the serum. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid, flavonoids (anthocyanins and 
chatechines), sulfites, histamine and other biogenic amines are the main causative agents of intolerance reactions (pseudoallergic 
reactions) to wine. After a short historic review of viticulture and the importance of wine in classical antiquity, we go into the 
chemical processes of alcoholic fermentation and the genetically inherited “flush syndrome” caused by an acetaldehyde 
dehydrogenase 2 polymorphism, subsequently we focus on the different etiologic factors of allergies and intolerance reactions to 
wine. The most frequent intolerance reactions to sulfites occur particularly after the ingestion of white wine and in asthma 
patients. Intolerance reactions to histamine and other biogenic amines occur mainly after ingestion of red wine and in persons 
with diamine oxidase (DAO) deficiency.

Introduction  
Isinglass is a pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders of specific tropical 
and subtropical fish, known in the industry as “maws”. Only certain species are selected for 
the isinglass used in brewing. These are certain catfish, croakers and threadfins.  
 
Swim bladders are part of the buoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs 
situated in the dorsal area of the body cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) 
muscles which make up the fish ""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the 
body cavity, thus when the fish are harvested, these swim bladders are readily detached and 
removed from the body of the fish without extr aneous tissue. Because of this, the levels of 
parvalbumin, which is the major allergen in fish and is found mainly in fish muscle, are low. 
Studies using an ELISA test for fish parvalbumin indicate that levels of parvalbumin in the 
swim bladders of those fish used for isinglass manufacture are in the range 7 – 30 mg/kg carp 
parvalbumin equivalents. These levels of parvalbumin are reduced to some extent during 
normal processing to prepare commercial isinglass products but can be further minimised by 
the use of buffer washes. Studies using the ELISA test referred to above indicate that normal 
processing reduces the range of parvalbumin concentrations slightly, but the introduction of an 
extra step of washing with phosphate buffer can achieve a significantly higher reduction. A 
Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, based on HACCP principles, has been developed by 
the BFBi in order to minimise levels of parvalbumin in their commercial isinglass-based 
products and to provide a common quality system for the industry. It is intended as a generic 
industry guide which has been adopted by the manufacturers concerned and has been 
incorporated into each company’s own HACCP system. 
 
Manufacture of isinglass  
 
1. Raw materials – pre-requisites 
 
1.1 Sourcing 
Analysis using the ELISA test has shown that levels of parvalbumin in swim bladders (maws) 
can vary between species. Consequently, only certain species are selected for the 
manufacture of isinglass. These are  
• Arius africanus  (sea catfish) 
• Arius dussumieri (blacktip catfish) 
• Arius maculatus (spotted catfish) 
• Bagrus docmak (bagrid catfish) 
• Bagrus Pseudopimelodus spp Bagre Blanco  (S.American White Catfish) 
• Cynoscions acoupa (Corvina del Lago) 
 
Maws for use by isinglass manufacturers are usually purchased from the same traders that 
supply the food market (the culinary market, for Chinese restaurants and delicatessen 
businesses, accounts for most of the volume of maws traded). These traders must be licensed 
to deal in foodstuffs by the Health Authorities in their respective countries. It is important for 
quality reasons that any maws destined for brewing and other beverage applications are 
cleaned and dried as soon as possible after being removed from the fish. Drying must be at 
ambient temperature in a good airflow without exposure to direct sunlight, which can cause 
damage through overheating (denaturation of the collagen). Great care must be taken during 
drying to avoid damaged by microbial growth.   
 
1.2 Packaging and Traceability Requirements 
The isinglass manufacturers specify that maws should be packed in new, food grade sacks 
and that shipping marks etc should not be sprayed/stenciled on the bags in such a way as to Page 3 of 12 
contaminate the maws inside with paint/ink. Maws should not be contaminated with pesticide 
residues. 
 
To ensure traceability each sack must be marked with  
• Supplier’s identification and lot number 
• maw type (species) 
• net weight 
 
Analytical specifications and visual checks at intake are used by the isinglass manufacturers 
to ensure the quality of their raw materials and that these pre-requisites have been met. 
Samples for pesticide residue analysis are taken after the milling stage of processing. 
 
1.3 Analytical specifications 
The following analytical specifications are set  
• Moisture                   16-22% ideally 17-19% 
• Protein                    >93% 
• Acid Soluble Protein           >90% 
• Collagen                   >88% 
 
 
2. Manufacturing process 
 
Good Manufacturing Practices for the production of Food Grade products are applied 
throughout the entire process. Isinglass products are very heat sensitive. Temperatures in 
excess of 18°C are therefore avoided during the manufacturing process to prevent damage to 
collagen (the active ingredient in isinglass). 
 
A flow diagram for the manufacturing process showing the HACCP Critical Control Points is 
given in Figure 1.  
 
2.1 Visual assessment (Critical Control Point No. 1) 
The outer packaging is removed and the fish maws are placed on a moving conveyor screen 
to remove fine dust particle and other loose material. The conveyor also allows the maws to 
be examined visually and any of doubtful quality to be removed. 
 
Maws are assessed visually to ensure that they are; 
• visually clean and free from infestation 
• free from tissue and fat residues  
• true in shape for the fish species specified 
• whole  
• not discloured (ideally of a pale yellow/straw colour) 
 
Supplier details and fish maw variety are recorded so the source and quality can be traced 
throughout the processing.  
 
2.1 Cleaning (Critical Control Point No. 2) 
The maws are then passed over a screen to remove foreign material such as metal fish hooks 
etc.  
 
2.2 Milling (Critical Control Points No. 3 and 4) 
The maws are first chopped so that they will pass through a 25mm screen. This finer particle 
size has two effects: 
 Page 4 of 12 
• it increases the surface area thus improving the extent of extraction of parvalbumin in 
the subsequent buffer wash 
• it ensures adequate sterilising during the peroxide wash  
 
The chopped product is then sieved to remove fines. The dry isinglass is then stored until 
required for processing. Details of the supplier and fish species are recorded for traceability. 
Metal fragments are removed by magnets, generally positioned between the mill and the 
screens.  
A representative sample of the fine milled material is taken for pesticide residue analysis. 
 
2.3 Sterilising (Critical Control Point No. 5).  
When required for processing, the dry chopped maws are transferred to the wet processing 
area. Here they are first sterilised by soaking in a solution of hydrogen peroxide and soaked 
for a minimum of 16 hours with intermittent stirring at approximately 4 hour intervals. The 
maws are then passed over a fine screen to remove the soluble impurities and fine insoluble 
material with the spent peroxide solution. The isinglass retained on the screen is rinsed with 
water. 
 
2.4  Buffer wash (Critical Control Point No. 6) 
The insoluble isinglass is then soaked in phosphate buffered saline (0.15M NaCl, 0.01M 
Na
2HPO4,pH7) for a minimum of 1 hour, drained, rinsed, then washed twice more with fresh 
water and finally drained. 
 
 This washing cycle removes the parvalbumin (whi ch is readily soluble at pH 7) from the 
isinglass, which is insoluble. The resultant wet isinglass is then further processed to a form 
suitable for the end user.  
 
2.5 Further processing 
Isinglass is sold in 3 different forms. 
1. Powder 
2. Aqueous Paste 
3. Aqueous Liquid. 
As mentioned earlier, for quality reasons it is critical to keep temperature <18 oC to prevent 
isinglass denaturing for both liquids and pastes. 
 
 
Powder: 
After washing, the wet isinglass is dried, either by freeze drying or using a low temperature air 
drier. The dried isinglass is then milled to a powder. It can be sold in this form to the user who 
dissolves it in dilute food grade acid prior to use. Alternatively, it may be blended with a 
powdered food grade organic acid by the isinglass manufacturer and sold to the end user as a 
ready-to-use powder. 
 
Aqueous Paste:   
After washing, the wet isinglass is added to water or to a buffer solution containing approved 
preservatives. This mix is then homogenised to give a fine paste for sale to the end user, who 
dissolves the paste in dilute food grade acid prior to use. 
 
 
Aqueous Liquid: 
After washing, the wet Isinglass is dissolved in dilute food grade acid solution containing 
approved preservatives. The resultant solution is then sold to the end user who further dilutes 
it with water prior to use. Page 5 of 12

1. Executive Summary  
  
This petition is submitted by the Brewing, Food and Beverage Industry Suppliers  
Association (BFBi) in support of a request for exemption from the labelling requirements of 
Section 403(w)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass 
when used as a fining/clarification processing aid in beer. This request is being sought on 
the grounds of: 
 
• clinical evidence (Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge) that fish sensitive     
individuals do not have allergic responses to isinglass, even when challenged with very high 
oral doses   
• the manufacturing process for isinglass minimizes allergenic potential  
• extremely low potential for dietary exposure to isinglass through beer consumption  
• long history of safe use  
• absence of published reports of allergenicity   
  
This document presents details on:    
1. composition and characterization of isinglass.  
2. development of an ELISA method for the detection of parvalbumin (the allergenic 
molecule generally associated with fish allergenicity) and it’s use in the 
quantification of parvalbumin in isinglass raw materials (‘fish maws’) and in 
commercially available, processed isinglass products. 
3. development of an ELISA method for the detection of residual isinglass in beer 
together with analytical results for levels of residual isinglass found in commercial 
beers. 
4. a ‘Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Isinglass’ adopted by the major 
producers of isinglass and specifically designed to minimize parvalbumin levels in 
commercial isinglass products. 
5. expected level of consumer exposure to isinglass and associated parvalbumin 
6. comprehensive literature searches was conducted to identify any documented 
instances of confirmed allergenic responses related to isinglass or to beers treated 
with isinglass. 
7. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and double blind placebo  
controlled oral challenge tests), carried out in Denmark and Switzerland and the 
associated protocols used.  
8. results of clinical trials (skin prick tests and oral challenge tests),   
carried out in France and the associated protocols used. 
 
 
The scientific studies described herein were conducted during the period 2004-2007 in 
support of a submission by BFBi and The Brewers of Europe for an exemption from Annex 
IIIa of EU Directive 2005/26/EC and thus from the requirement to label isinglass, under 
allergen labelling regulations, when used as a clarifying aid in brewing.   Page 4 of 26 
 
The petitioners note that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered their 
Opinion (adopted on 6th July 2007), concluding that ‘the Panel considers that it is not very 
likely that isinglass used as clarifying agent in beer will trigger a severe allergic reaction in 
susceptible individuals under the conditions of production and use specified’ (Appendix 
11). Isinglass was subsequently granted a permanent exemption from allergen labelling, 
this exemption being granted for both beer and wine (Appendix 11A). 
It is also noted that Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) deliberated on a 
request by the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council of New Zealand, an application subsequently 
taken over by the Brewers Association of New Zealand, for the exemption of isinglass from 
allergen labelling requirement when used as a clarifying agent in beer and wine. FSANZ 
undertook a robust and extensive assessment of the public health and safety implications 
and concluded that since residual isinglass in beer and wine, if present, did not exceed 
1mg/liter of bottled beer or wine and since parvalbumin was demonstrated to co-sediment 
with and thus be removed by sedimentation or filtration then the consumption of isinglass-
fined beer and wine was not likely to present a risk of allergic reactions in fish-allergic 
consumers. FSANZ also deliberated on the wider aspects of such allergen labelling 
requirements, including potential impact on consumer choice, cost to industry, cost to 
Government enforcement agencies, and international trade considerations. FSANZ 
approved an exemption from the requirement to declare isinglass on the label when present 
in beer and wine as a result of its use as a clarifying agent (Appendix 12) 
It is the position of Health Canada that if an ingredient derived from Canada's priority a food 
allergen source (like a fining agent) is added to a food during its production but later is 
removed from the food, so that it is no longer present in the finished food, then that will not 
trigger the application of Canada’s allergen labelling regulations. This is the situation for 
most commercial wines even where the a  food allergen source of the derived fining agent 
is used is from food considered a priority allergen source (i.e. the priority that the allergen 
food source derived fining agent is added to the wine but later removed by effective 
filtration and is no longer present in the finished wine). The fact that the protein from the 
food allergen is not present in the finished wine means that the use of the fining agent is not 
expected to pose a risk to allergic consumers, and so allergen labelling regulations would 
not be triggered. 
With regards to the use of isinglass in beer, isinglass is derived from the dried swim 
bladders of fish and consists primarily of collagen, which is a protein.  If the isinglass is used 
as a fining agent in the beer but is then removed by filtration or some other method and the 
isinglass is no longer present in the finished beer, then no labelling would be 
required.  Health Canada have taken the view that any protein present in an ingredient 
derived from a priority food allergen source should be regarded as a potential allergen. The 
published studies, including food challenge clinical tests,  clearly indicate that collagen, the 
primary protein in isinglass, does not elicit an allergic response in fish sensitive individuals. 
It is the opinion of the petitioners that the scientific evidence and conclusions presented 
herein remain valid and, in particular, the clinical studies described remain in line with 
current best practice for assessing allergenic potential of a food substance. Page 5 of 26 
 
The petitioners are supportive of informative allergen labelling. The petitioners 
acknowledge that ‘fish’ is a common cause of allergies and that fish-derived material may 
also contain potential allergens. However, all available published evidence indicates that 
isinglass, when used as a beer fining agent, does not cause an allergic response that poses a 
risk to human health when consumed by fish sensitive individuals.  
  
Isinglass used in brewing is a pure form of collagen (greater than 92% collagen on a  
dry, ash free basis). It is derived from the swim bladders of specific physostomatous  
tropical and sub-tropical fish. In these fish, the swim bladder forms a distinct organ  
which can be readily detached as a discrete entity, and as such is unlikely to be  
contaminated with significant quantities of skeletal muscle (fish meat) or other tissue.  
The isinglass raw material (swim bladders or ‘fish maws’) are processed under defined 
conditions to produce saleable isinglass in various forms (powder, paste or liquid). The dry 
powder form is typically supplied as a blend containing microbiological stabilizer and acid 
required to solubilize the collagen molecules and produce liquid isinglass which is then 
applied in the beer or winemaking process,  
The isinglass solution used in brewing consists mainly of solubilized collagen molecules 
(mostly as dimers and trimers with molecular weights of 800-1300kDa) together with 
lesser amounts of gelatine (denatured collagen), low levels of elastin plus low levels (<5% 
concentration) of other non-collagenous material. Very low levels of material that react in a 
dose-dependent manner in ELISA assay designed to detect Gad c1 parvalbumin (presumed 
to be parvalbumin) have also been identified in isinglass. Unlike many allergens, pepsin 
digestion studies have demonstrated that isinglass is readily and completely hydrolyzed by 
pepsin.   
  
Isinglass is used as a clarifying agent in brewing. It is added at a low dosage (typically 
15mg/litre; total range 10-60mg/litre) to the beer after fermentation, where it reacts with 
yeast and proteins, forming large flocs. These flocs are removed from the bulk of the liquid 
by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation. Residual isinglass levels in treated beers have 
been quantified using an ELISA assay developed to detect residual levels of isinglass in beer. 
Beer as presented to consumers will typically contain levels ranging from 0 – 5.0 mg/litre 
maximum. Brewery-conditioned beers (filtered beers) typically contain less residual 
isinglass than traditional unfiltered British cask beers but results indicate that no types of 
beer contain more than 5 mg/litre.  
Parvalbumin is not detectable in beer, even when isinglass is dosed at rates which are more 
than double the highest known commercial rates.  
  
Although isinglass has been used as a beer clarifying agent for centuries, extensive  
searches of the scientific and medical literature have not identified any documented  
cases of allergic reaction due to isinglass. This absence of documented evidence of  
allergic reactions to isinglass in beer suggests that such a response, if it exists at all,  
is extremely rare.   
  Page 6 of 26 
 
Results from investigation into parvalbumin levels in isinglass products confirm that  
commercial isinglass products may contain parvalbumin at extremely low levels (around 1 
μg/g on dry weight basis). The manufacturing process for isinglass includes several steps 
that are designed specifically to minimize levels of residual parvalbumin in commercial 
products.  
 
Comprehensive clinical studies on the allergenic potential of isinglass have  
been carried out. Oral challenges have demonstrated no allergic reaction in 21 fish  
sensitive individuals when challenged with isinglass at very high rates, despite skin  
prick tests having confirmed that the species of fish used in isinglass production are  
capable of inducing allergic response in some fish sensitive individuals. It should also be  
noted that since the actual residual amounts of isinglass in commercial beers are  
very low, the oral challenge doses equate to extremely high rates of beer consumption  
(greater in some instances than would be physically possible to consume).   
  
BFBi hereby request exemption from the labelling requirements of Section 403(w)(1) of the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) for isinglass used as a 
fining/clarification aid in beer production on the basis that there is no allergic response 
elicited in fish-allergic individuals consuming beers fined with isinglass, even at 
theoretically impossible levels of beer consumption.

and beverage industries, from raw materials through to process equipment, packaging,  
dispense and point of sale.  
 
3. Subject of Petition  
Isinglass is the usual term for piscine collagen; within the context of this petition 
""isinglass"" is used exclusively to mean the collagen obtained from the dried swim  
bladders of the fish rather than from fish skins. Isinglass used in brewing (and wine) is a 
pure form of collagen derived from the dried swim bladders (known in the industry as  
“maws”) of specific tropical and subtropical fish. Only a restricted range of species  
are used; these are specific catfish, croakers and threadfins.  Swim bladders are part of the 
buoyancy mechanism of bony fish, and are distinct organs situated in the dorsal area of the 
body cavity, quite separate from the voluntary (skeletal) muscles which make up the fish 
""meat"". There is little adherence between the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the 
fish are processed, these swim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of 
the fish without extraneous tissue. Thus levels of parvalbumin (the major allergen in fish, 
which is associated with fish muscle) would be expected to be low.   
   
ELISA methods have been developed in order to measure the actual levels of parvalbumin 
in the dried fish maws and in the processed isinglass. Details are provided in Section 6 
(Analytical data).    Page 7 of 26 
 
  
Isinglass used in the brewing industry is prepared from fish maws by a defined series of 
processes. The manufacturing process includes a buffer washing stage that is particularly 
efficient at removing the low levels of parvalbumin that might be associated with the raw 
materials. The manufacturing process is described in the ‘Code of Good Manufacturing 
Practice for Isinglass’. Details are provided in Section 4 (Manufacturing process).    
  
Isinglass has been used for several centuries to clarify beer. At the end of the  
primary fermentation beer contains large quantities of yeast and suspended protein  
solids which must be removed from the beer. The contribution from yeast is typically  
in the range 100 to 400 mg/l (dry solids) equivalent to 1x106 to 4x106 cells/ml. Protein  
particles contribute a further 150 to 300 mg/l (dry solids).   
  
After fermentation the beer/yeast mixture is cooled to halt yeast growth. For brewery- 
conditioned beers, isinglass can be added to the beer at this stage. It reacts with the  
flocculating yeast and protein particles, causing them to sediment rapidly at the base  
of the storage vessel, so that the majority can be removed prior to filtration. Once the  
sedimented solids (consisting of isinglass, yeast and protein) are removed, the beer  
can then be filtered, typically through a bed of kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth). High  
speed centrifugation can replace filtration in certain treated beers. The dosage rate of  
isinglass is typically 15 mg/litre for brewery-conditioned beers.  
  
Cask-conditioned beer is a specific style of beer in the UK (sometimes referred to as  
real ale) and represents an important traditional product. In this style of beer the yeast 
remains in the cask, and promotes flavour changes that contribute to the essential character 
of the final product. Isinglass is dosed either into the beer before it is transferred to the cask 
or directly into the cask. The action of isinglass takes place generally within the first 3 to 4 
hours after cask filling so that the flocculated solids (yeast plus isinglass plus protein) 
rapidly settle to the base of the cask, forming a compact sediment. The beer is drawn from 
the cask at a point above the sediment, so that it remains bright, (i.e. no cloudiness) and free 
of suspended particles. Cloudy beer is not acceptable to the consumer in this type of  
product. (It should be noted that there are other styles of beer which are typically  
cloudy, for example, wheat beers: however, these are not fined with isinglass).  
Dosage rates for cask-conditioned beers are typically in the range 35-60 mg/litre.   
   
Since the added isinglass is removed from the treated beer by either filtration, 
centrifugation and/or sedimentation, residual levels in the beer as consumed are expected 
to be very low. Investigations into the actual residues of isinglass remaining in beer have  
been carried out, using a highly sensitive antibody-based method. These studies are 
described in Section 6 (Analytical data).   
Although not the subject of this petition, it is noted that the similarities between the 
application of isinglass in beer and wine, together with scientific studies performed to 
assess the allergenic potential of wine treated with isinglass suggests that it is not likely that 
isinglass-treated wine presents a risk to fish-sensitive wine consumers. (Appendix 12 pp54-
56)  
  
4. Manufacturing process  
  
Isinglass is sold in 3 main forms – powder, paste, and pre-dissolved ‘ready to use’  Page 8 of 26 
 
liquids. Powders are typically pre-blended with dry acid, and often include a source of  
sulfur dioxide in the form of sodium or potassium metabisulfite. Paste is a hydrated form of 
isinglass, typically 10% w/w isinglass, where the particle size has been reduced to less than 
1 mm. ‘Ready to use’ liquids are dilute acidic solutions of isinglass containing between 0.3 
and 1.0 % w/w isinglass. Sulfur dioxide is included as a preservative.  
Studies described in Section 6 (Analytical data) established that the traditional 
manufacturing process could be adapted to minimize the presence of the common fish 
allergen, parvalbumin, in isinglass.  The new manufacturing process for isinglass (Appendix 
1) was implemented by the isinglass manufacturers in 2007 and the process is outlined 
below.   
• Maws are inspected visually at intake to ensure that they are not discolored, are free 
from infestation and are of the specified fish species.   
• Maws are blended by type to meet quality, functionality, cost and supply criteria.  
• Maw size is reduced by granulation (to max 25mm) to facilitate subsequent cleaning 
and sterilization.  
• Granules are sterilized in dilute hydrogen peroxide solution 
• Granules are thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water 
• The sterilized granules are then soaked in a phosphate buffer solution 
• The granules are then thoroughly washed and rinsed with chilled water  
• The granules are then dried in a controlled environment with temperature not 
exceeding 400C (1040F) 
 
Note that during the wet processing stages a temperature below 150C (590F)is maintained 
and the temperature of acidified liquid ’ready to use’ isinglass is maintained below 10oC 
(500F). 
  
The analytical studies described in Section 6 indicate that low levels of parvalbumin  
can be found in fish maws prior to processing, up to a maximum of around 30 µg/g (mg/kg). 
Fish species with apparently high parvalbumin levels in the swim bladders are not used in 
isinglass production. 
Phosphate buffer, routinely used in clinical studies to extract parvalbumin from fish flesh 
(Lehrer, 1986), is included in isinglass processing to ensure parvalbumin levels are 
minimized. The levels of residual parvalbumin achievable in commercial isinglass products 
are typically below 1 µg/g (mg/kg), on a dry weight basis.  
The detailed industry-agreed Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for isinglass is included 
as Appendix 1.  
 
5. Documented History of Non-allergenicity  
  
Comprehensive literature searches in 2004 by Nerac (a specialist data retrieval company)  
and Dr Steve Taylor of Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP) at the  
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA)  did not identify any reports of allergic  
responses to isinglass or to fish maws (which are widely consumed as a food in their  
own right amongst Chinese ethnic populations). The searches also failed to find any  
reports of allergic responses to beer which could be attributed to the use of isinglass  Page 9 of 26 
 
(of the few reports of allergic responses to beer which were found, most were cereal- 
related ; one was related to the proteolytic enzyme papain, two were related to yeast  
and one was related to an allergy to pollen). Other reports were related to biogenic  
amines, ethanol and ethanol metabolites and sulfites.     
  
This search was repeated in 2007 by Nerac, using the same key words (beer, brewery,  
allergy, non-allergenic, anaphylactic, hypersensitivity) to identify any reports which  
might have been published since 2004. Additional search terms were also used  
(parvalbumin, isinglass).  Again no reports of allergic responses to beer or isinglass by fish 
sensitive individuals were found. The three papers that mentioned ‘isinglass’ or ‘fish maws’.  
  
• Taylor, 2004; was a review article and did not contain any reports of  
allergic responses to either isinglass or to fish maws.   
• Chlup, 2006; reported analysis of isinglass residues in  
beer. This is discussed in section 6.1 (Isinglass residues in beer).    
•Phillips, 2003; was a report for a brewing journal of the allergen  
labelling Directive 2000/13/EC.  
Full copies of these articles are included in the References section.    
 
A paper published after the 2007 search was completed, describes double  
blind placebo controlled oral challenge trials with wine clarified with protein fining  
agents (Rolland et al, 2006). The study included 10 fish-allergic patients, who were  
challenged with wine fined with isinglass and with un-fined wine as a control. No  
allergic reactions to the isinglass-fined wine were reported by any of the patients.   
An updated literature search was commissioned in 2025 to see if any new reports were 
published since 2007. The search terms used were the same as previously and the search 
was conducted by Intertek (a global consultancy firm). Across all sources, no documented 
IgE-mediated allergic reactions were attributed to isinglass in beer (or wine), even among 
fish-allergic individuals.

Based on the collective evidence from clinical studies, analytical detection methods, animal 
models, and regulatory reviews, there is no substantiated evidence that isinglass used in 
beer or wine production elicits IgE-mediated allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals. 
Even in cases where in vitro sensitization markers (e.g., skin prick tests or basophil 
activation tests) were positive, no clinical symptoms were observed upon ingestion.  
The full search results are included as Appendix 2 and Appendix 2.A   
 
 6. Analytical data  
  
6.1 Isinglass residues in beer  
As described earlier, residues of isinglass in fined beers are low, since the majority of  
the isinglass added is either removed by centrifugation and/or filtration (for brewery-
conditioned beers) or by sedimentation (for cask-conditioned beers). Analysis of isinglass 
residues in beer is problematic, not only because of the low levels, but also because of the 
presence of other unrelated proteins. Published studies where beer has not been 
concentrated prior to analysis have failed to detect any isinglass residues (Chlup, 2006).  
  
 A method has been developed whereby residual isinglass present in isinglass treated beers 
can be concentrated by means of an antibody raised using isinglass as an antigen. The  
separated isinglass can then be hydrolyzed to its constituent acids and quantified by  
measuring the content of hydroxyproline, which is an imino acid present in significant  
quantities only in animal collagens. The limit of quantification of this method, that is  
the concentration of isinglass in beer which can be distinguished from background  
levels of hydroxyproline, is 0.17 mg of isinglass / litre of beer (on an isinglass dry  
weight basis).   
  
This method has been used to quantify the concentration of isinglass residues which  
could be present in brewery and cask-conditioned beers, and also to determine  
whether there is likely to be stratification of residues in casks, such that beer drawn  
from a position close to the bottom of the cask but still clear enough to be  
marketable, could nevertheless contain significantly higher concentrations of  
isinglass.   
  
The results indicate that isinglass residues in many bottled and canned beers fined with  
isinglass in the brewery are below the limit of quantification of the method. Where  
isinglass could be quantified, the highest concentrations found did not exceed  
1mg/litre.  
  
For large containers (kegs and casks), isinglass concentrations were only slightly  
higher. Residues in kegs were also generally below 1 mg/litre, although occasional  Page 12 of 26 
 
samples could contain up to 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned (unfiltered) beers, the  
highest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  
  
There was no evidence of stratification of residues within either casks or kegs. The  
concentration of isinglass in noticeably hazy beer (that is, beer drawn from just above  
the level of sedimented material) was marginally higher than in the bulk, but still  
below 5 mg/litre.   
The full report of this investigation is included as Appendix 3.   
 
6.2 Analysis of proteins in source fish, swim bladders, commercial isinglass  
products and beer   
  
6.2.1. Extraction methods and SDS analysis of fish and swim bladders (maws)  
 
The SDS-PAGE band patterns for extracts of fish used as isinglass sources were  
similar to those of other fish, including cod, and all samples showed a clear band at  
12 kDa which is characteristic of parvalbumin. Extracts of swim bladders (maws) did  
not display this characteristic band. However, the presence of parvalbumin could not  
be completely ruled out on the basis of SDS electrophoresis.  
Western Blotting was also carried out on extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders  
(maws) in order to try and confirm the presence or absence of parvalbumin.  
Parvalbumin could be detected in all samples of fish flesh. However, with the swim  
bladders, traces of parvalbumin could be detected in only one sample.   
  
Full details of the experimental methods and results are given in Appendix 4.  
  
  
6.2.2 Residual parvalbumin in swim bladders and in isinglass  
 
 The principal components of isinglass are collagen and elastin, together with  
degradation products of collagen, such as gelatine, which are not major fish  
allergens. Less than 5% of isinglass is non-collagenous material (Hickman et al,  
2000) (Leach and Barrett, 1967a) (Moir et al, 1984).  There is little adherence  
between the bladder and the body cavity, thus when the fish are processed, these  
swim bladders are readily detached and removed from the body of the fish without  
extraneous tissue. Thus isinglass would not be expected to contain substantial  
amounts of parvalbumin and no definitive values have been reported in the  
literature. ELISA tests for fish parvalbumins (carp and cod) have therefore been  
developed in order to measure parvalbumin in swim bladders and in commercial samples of  
isinglass and beer.  
  Page 13 of 26 
 
As a preliminary, an investigation into the homology of fish parvalbumins was carried  
out by Food Allergy Research & Resource Program (FARRP).  This showed a high degree of 
sequence identity, indicating a high likelihood of IgE cross–reactivity. A full report of the 
homology search is given in Appendix 5.   
  
A restricted number of fish species are used in isinglass manufacture, and  
commercial products are generally made from a blend of species, chosen to provide  
the technological qualities required by the brewer. Preliminary studies on these  
source materials were carried out using an inhibition ELISA test based on carp  
parvalbumin, since the cod parvalbumin ELISA was not yet available. Details of the  
carp ELISA are given in Appendix 6. These tests indicated that low levels of  
parvalbumin could be detected in a range of swim bladders, the starting raw materials for 
isinglass (see Table 1).   
  
These studies also suggested that swim bladders from certain species contained  
more parvalbumin than others. Accordingly it was decided that those species with  
higher levels of parvalbumin which were not otherwise essential in commercial blends  
for functional reasons would no longer be used, and a common list of 6 species was agreed 
by the manufacturers. This species list was incorporated into the Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice described in Section 4.

6.2.3 Minimization of residual parvalbumin in isinglass  
 
Washing with phosphate buffer is a well-recognized technique for extracting  
parvalbumin from fish flesh, and is widely utilized in research studies (Lehrer, 1986).  
Trials were therefore initiated to determine whether phosphate buffer could be used  
to further reduce residual parvalbumin in isinglass products.   
  
Powdered isinglass, prepared using a typical commercial blend of fish species, was  
tested for parvalbumin using the carp ELISA before and after washing with water and  
with phosphate buffer, on the laboratory scale. The results (shown in Table 2)  
indicate that phosphate buffer washing could significantly reduce residual  
parvalbumin. An alternative approach, washing with calcium solutions, had no effect.  
 
 
  
Table 2. Effect of washing on parvalbumin residues in isinglass (laboratory  
scale)

carp equivalents) 
Unwashed isinglass control (3 replicates) 4.6 – 5.0 
Water wash 3.0 
Phosphate buffer wash 1.4 
Calcium solution wash 5.3 
(Original data – Appendix 6, Table 1.3) 
  
These trials were repeated on a production scale, but using isinglass preparations  
from single sources of fish maws in order to compare the extent of reduction. (As noted 
previously, commercial isinglass products are typically made up of blends from several but 
limited (see above) fish species). Results (given in Table 3) confirmed that washing with 
phosphate buffer could indeed reduce residual parvalbumin on the commercial scale. 
Although not all samples showed a significant reduction, the greatest effects were with 
those samples containing the highest initial parvalbumin. Since commercial isinglass 
products are made from blends of swim bladders from different sources, it appeared likely 
that phosphate buffer washing, if incorporated into the manufacturing process, could 
significantly reduce the range of residual parvalbumin in commercial products.

Following these promising preliminary results, trials were undertaken to optimize the 
washing protocols in order to achieve maximum parvalbumin removal.    
The extent of parvalbumin reduction throughout the manufacturing process was  
then checked again using a sandwich ELISA test based on cod parvalbumin, which had been 
specifically developed for this project (see Appendix 4). The starting material was isinglass 
powder from a typical commercial blend, using the six agreed species. The results (shown in 
Table 4) confirmed that residual parvalbumin can be significantly reduced to around 0.4 
µg/g on an isinglass dry weight basis, a reduction of approximately 4-fold over the original 
level in the raw material.  
  
This processing protocol has subsequently been implemented as a ‘Code of Good 
Manufacturing Practice’ by the major isinglass manufacturers, as described in Section 4.

6.2.4  Impact of new manufacturing protocol on residual parvalbumin in isinglass  
 
Residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass products manufactured prior to the 
implementation of the new manufacturing protocol were determined using  
the cod ELISA test (see Appendix 4). The nominal limit of detection of this method is  
0.20 µg/g. The results, shown in Table 5, suggest that the levels of residual  
parvalbumin in commercial isinglass products manufactured prior to the introduction of the 
new manufacturing protocol were in the range <0.2 – 35 µg/g dry weight, but typically less 
than 10 µg/g.

An assessment of residual parvalbumin levels in commercial isinglass products 
manufactured according to the new manufacturing protocol demonstrates the effectiveness 
of this new process in reducing parvalbumin residues, with levels typically less than 1 
μ/g.(Table 6).

6.2.5 Residues of parvalbumin in beer  
 
The overwhelming majority of the isinglass added to beer for clarification is removed, 
either by centrifugation and/or filtration (for brewery-conditioned beers) or by 
sedimentation (for cask-conditioned beers).   
  
Using the analytical method described in Section 6.1 whereby any isinglass present is 
concentrated, it has been demonstrated that residues of isinglass in brewery-conditioned 
bottled and canned beers were largely below 0.17 mg/litre (the limit of quantification of the 
method), with the highest concentrations found not exceeding 1mg/litre. For brewery 
conditioned beers in keg, residues did not exceed 3 mg/litre. For cask-conditioned beers, 
the highest concentration of isinglass found did not exceed 5 mg/litre.  
  
The analyses described in Section 6.2.4, Tables 4 & 6, indicated that residual parvalbumin  
levels in commercial isinglass products produced using the new protocol described in 
Section 4 would be expected to be less than 1 µg/g. If it is assumed that the parvalbumin in 
isinglass remains associated with it during the fining process, the theoretical maximum for 
residues of parvalbumin remaining in fined beer would be in the range <0.001 – 0.005 
µg/litre. This is illustrated in Table 7.   
  
The measurement uncertainty of the cod ELISA is relatively high. If this is taken into  
account (i.e. measured value + 3 x Standard Deviation), the concentration of  
parvalbumin in isinglass manufactured using the new production protocol could be  
4 µg/g. This would give a theoretical concentration of parvalbumin of 0.02 µg/litre for  
a “worst case” (i.e. a cask beer with the highest level of isinglass residues detected) .   Page 18 of 26 
 
 These levels of parvalbumin are extremely low and well below the limit of  
determination of the analytical method.

6.2.6 Association of parvalbumin and isinglass during fining of beer  
 
One scenario which needs to be considered is the possibility that parvalbumin (which  
is  known to be soluble in water and dilute salt solutions at neutral and alkaline pH’s)  
could be extracted from isinglass into the bulk of the beer during the fining process,  
rather than partitioning with the isinglass and thus being removed  with it. In this case  
parvalbumin residues in beer could potentially be higher. Chemistry theory suggests that 
this is unlikely, since parvalbumin is not very soluble in acid conditions. The isoelectric 
point (which is the pH at which it is least soluble) of the main isoform of fish parvalbumin is 
generally considered to be around 4.7 (Bugajska-Schretter et al, 2000), with other isoforms 
being around 4.4 (Swoboda et al, 2002). Studies of three species of catfish (although not the 
same species as used for commercial isinglass) found isoelectric points of most isoforms to 
be in the range 4.5 – 4.8 (Focant, et al, 1999).  Beer pH is typically in the range 4.0 – 4.4.  
 
  
The behavior of parvalbumin during the fining process was investigated on a commercial 
scale, using a 2127 hl beer tank.  Isinglass finings (7.7 kg), prepared using historical 
manufacturing protocol, were added, equivalent to a typical commercial finings dose of 36 
mg/litre. Assuming a typical parvalbumin content of 10 µg/g, this would be approximately 
0.36 μg parvalbumin/litre of beer. The sedimented material, which contains isinglass and 
beer proteins, was collected and tested for parvalbumin. The concentration of parvalbumin 
in the sediment (carp equivalents) was found to be 120 μg/litre, suggesting that 
parvalbumin was significantly concentrated in the beer sediment (which is not consumed) 
rather than partitioning into the bulk of the beer (see Appendix 6A).    
   
 Page 19 of 26 
 
Further experiments were conducted using the cod ELISA in order to determine  
whether detectable parvalbumin remained in the beer. A lager and a cask ale were  
fined using isinglass at typical commercial dose rates (10 mg/litre and 40 mg/litre  
respectively), using an isinglass preparation made using the new manufacturing protocol 
with the same blend of fish species, in the same ratios, as the blend used for the clinical 
tests. The clear beer was freeze dried, which achieved a concentration of approximately 22-
fold, and the freeze-dried powder tested for parvalbumin using the cod ELISA. The limit of  
detection achieved by this procedure was equivalent to approximately 9 µg/litre  
parvalbumin in beer. No parvalbumin could be detected in either of the two beers.  
  
 A third beer was dosed with commercial isinglass powder 2 from Manufacturer 1  
(see Table 5), which contained a relatively high concentration of parvalbumin  
(7.32 µg/g as detected with the cod ELISA). The dose rate of isinglass in this  
case was 156 mg/litre, which is 3-4 times the dose rate typically used for beer and  
double the highest dose rate likely to be used commercially. The clear beer was  
freeze dried as before, and the freeze-dried powder analyzed for parvalbumin using the  
cod ELISA.  As before, no parvalbumin could be detected in the beer. Theoretical  
calculation suggested that even this high isinglass dose rate would deliver a  
concentration of parvalbumin of not more than 1.14 µg/litre, still below the limit of  
detection of the method.   
(Original data, Appendix. 7, Table 1).   
   
A further attempt to determine whether parvalbumin could be detected in  
commercially fined beer was carried out using the carp ELISA, which appeared to be  
slightly more sensitive than the cod-based test.   
  
• Two control samples consisted of two commercial brands of beer which had  
not been fined with isinglass.   
• Three trials, consisting of beer which was fined on a commercial scale using  
typical dose rates of commercial isinglass pastes   
  
The control and test beers were concentrated by freeze drying in order to achieve a  
parvalbumin level closer to the lower limit of detection, then analysed for parvalbumin at 
FARRP using the carp ELISA.   The results indicated that the range of “parvalbumin” 
detected in the test beers, after correction for concentration, was similar to, or indeed lower 
than, that in the control. Since the control beer contained no animal products whatsoever, 
this apparent “parvalbumin” must be due to non-specific binding to other components of 
the beer. Such non-specific binding is known to occur with ELISA-based tests and would in 
this case be exacerbated by the concentration of the sample. The conclusion is therefore  
that the beers fined with isinglass contained no detectable parvalbumin (Appendix 6A, 
Part 2)   
 
 Page 20 of 26 
 
7. Exposure data  
  
The studies referred to in Section 6 indicate that if present at all, levels of parvalbumin in  
beers are below the limit of detection, that is, less than 9 µg/litre. Residual parvalbumin 
residues in isinglass manufactured according to the old protocol are typically 10μg/g (dry 
weight basis). The new manufacturing protocol reduces potential parvalbumin residues to 
below 1µ/g (dry weight basis).    
  
Since parvalbumin residues in beer (if present) are too low to measure, potential  
residues have been calculated on a theoretical basis. The assumptions used are:  
  
• The dose rate of isinglass during fining is 50 mg/litre. This is around the highest  
dose rate which would be used commercially for cask beers, and is 2-3 times  
higher than the rate used for most brewery-conditioned beers.  
• Residual parvalbumin level in isinglass products manufactured using the old protocol is  
10μg/g (dry weight basis) cod equivalents.  
• Residual parvalbumin in commercial products manufactured using the new production 
protocol is 1 µg/ (dry weight basis).  
• Parvalbumin co-sediments with isinglass and does not partition into the bulk of  
the beer.  
  
Table 8 shows the maximum potential exposure to parvalbumin which would be 
experienced by a person drinking at a moderate rate (1.5 liters of beer in 2 hours) and a 
heavy drinker (3 liters in 2 hours). It can be seen that the greatest exposure, that is, for a 
heavy drinker consuming beer fined with isinglass manufactured as per the old protocol, 
would be around 0.15 µg parvalbumin in 2 hours. This exposure falls to around 0.015 µg 
when isinglass manufactured using the new manufacturing Code of Practice is used.

Even if the parvalbumin did not co-sediment with the isinglass, which appears  
unlikely both on theoretical grounds and from experimental data, the maximum  
theoretical exposure for a heavy drinker would not exceed 0.15 µg in 2 hours when isinglass  
manufactured according to the new manufacturing protocol is used.   
 
8. Pre-clinical data  
  
8.1 Pepsin digestion  
It is recognized that allergenic proteins are frequently resistant to digestion in the gut,  
thus digestibility by pepsin is often used as a parameter for assessing potential  
allergens. The major fish allergen Gad c 1 is comparatively resistant to pepsin  
digestion (Bindslev-Jensen et al., 2003).  
  
Isinglass was analyzed for digestibility by pepsin, using a similar approach to that  
widely used for assessing the digestibility of several allergens and proteins  
considered to be non-allergenic (Thomas et al., 2004). Digestibility of peanut  
allergens was used as a reference. It was found that isinglass was digested  
significantly faster than peanut allergens both at pH 1.2 and pH 2.0. No high  
molecular weight material remained after 2 minutes incubation with pepsin at pH 1.2,  
or 5 minutes at pH 2.0. All low and intermediate molecular weight material was fully  
digested at the end of the 60 minute incubation.  Full details of the experimental  
procedure and results are given in Appendix 8.    
  
  
9. Clinical (human) data  
  
9.1 Preparation of fish extract for clinical studies  
The preparation of extracts of fish suitable for use in clinical studies was based on  
findings from the protein analyses described in Appendix 4. The extracts were  Page 22 of 26 
 
checked for any microbiological contamination as described in Appendix 9.A.  
  
 
9.2. Skin prick tests  
  
9.2.1 Protocols  
FARRP have developed protocols for skin prick testing of fish allergic individuals,  
using extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders from a range of species used as  
source fish for commercial isinglass manufacture. Samples of blood are also taken  
from the individuals and tested for IgE antibodies to fish. The detailed protocols are  
given in Appendix 9.B.  Studies have been carried out at Odense University Hospital in 
Denmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the University of Zurich 
in Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber. 
  
9.2.2 Results  
Studies of 8 patients in Denmark were completed. All 8 of the patients reacted to the fish 
flesh, and 7 out of 8 reacted to the swim bladder extracts, suggesting that fish allergic 
patients in Western Europe would be likely to react to the fish species from which isinglass 
is obtained. Detailed results are given in Appendix 9.D.  
  
9.3 Oral challenge tests – FARRP protocol  
FARRP developed standard protocols for double blind placebo controlled  
(DBPCFC) oral challenge tests, using a commercial sample isinglass (manufactured 
according to the new protocol) as the challenge material. The detailed protocols are given in 
Appendix 9.C. Isinglass at four dose rates (0.5, 5, 15 and 30 mg) was administered over a 
total period of 2 hours.  Table 9 shows the amount of beer which these doses of isinglass are 
equivalent to. It is apparent that the cumulative dose over 2 hours substantially  
exceeds the equivalent volume (50.5 liters) of beer which it is physically possible to drink in 
that period of time.

The isinglass used for the oral challenges was prepared using the new manufacturing 
protocols. The parvalbumin content as determined by the two ELISA tests was 1.0 µg/g 
(carp parvalbumin equivalents) and 0.695 +/-0.30 µg/g (cod parvalbumin equivalents).    
  
Oral challenge studies of 15 fish allergic patients were carried out at the same  
centers as, and in conjunction with, the skin prick tests, namely, Odense University  
Hospital in Denmark, under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bindslev-Jensen, and at the  
University of Zurich in Switzerland, under the direction of Dr Barbara Ballmer-Weber.  
Details of these studies are reported in Appendix 9.D.   
 
None of the patients reacted to the oral challenges with isinglass, even at the very highest 
doses administered.   
  
 9.4 Skin prick tests and oral challenge tests, French protocol  
 
Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food challenge trials were also carried out by  
Dr Fabienne Rancé at the Hôpital des Enfants, Allergy and Pneumology, Toulouse,  
in France, using slightly different protocols. These are shown in Appendix 9.E. The  
oral challenge consisted of a cumulative dose of 20 mg of isinglass, in three doses of 2, 6 and 
12 mg isinglass, at 30 minute intervals over a period of 2 hours. In this case the total dose of 
isinglass was equivalent to at least 4 liters of beer fined at the maximum commercial rate, or 
20 liters of typical brewery conditioned beer. It should be noted however, that these trials 
were initiated before it was known that isinglass could contain parvalbumin, thus the 
isinglass used in the challenge contained more parvalbumin (a typical level would be up to 
10 µg/g) than that used in the FARRP protocols.   Page 24 of 26 
 
  
Tests of six patients with fish allergies were completed using these protocols.  
Skin prick tests with positive and negative controls to confirm allergenicity to fish,  
were carried out first. Two out of the six showed positive reactions to the skin prick  
tests, but there were no positive reactions to the oral challenge tests. (See Appendix  
9.F).   
  
  
11. Expert Opinion on the allergenicity of isinglass (FARRP)  
  
Experts at FARRP (the Food Allergy Research and Resource Programme at the  
University of Nebraska, USA) were asked to give an expert opinion on the  
allergenicity of isinglass. This Opinion is included as Appendix 10.  
  
In the view of FARRP, ingestion of isinglass does not present a risk to fish allergic 
individuals. FARRP consider that the very high doses of isinglass used, together with the 
complete lack of allergic reactions, adequately compensate for the fact that the original 
target of 29 patients was not achieved (see Appendix 9D).  
  
Since the oral challenges were carried out with significant quantities of isinglass itself,  
and the amount of isinglass remaining in fined beer is extremely small, it follows that  
drinking beer fined with isinglass is even less likely to present any hazard to fish-allergic 
individuals.  
  
12. Conclusions  
  
Using the analytical methods described in this report, low but variable amounts  
of parvalbumin are shown to be associated with commercial isinglass. These levels can be 
substantially reduced by limiting the species of source fish used and by simple 
modifications to the isinglass manufacturing process. Both of these changes have been 
incorporated into a Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, implemented by isinglass 
producers since 2007.  
  
Despite the possible presence of very low levels of parvalbumin in commercial isinglass 
products, the potential for parvalbumin to remain in beer is extremely low. The actual 
potential amounts of parvalbumin added to beer during fining (and also to wine, the other 
beverage where isinglass is commonly used as a fining agent) are extremely small. Both 
chemical theory and the experimental evidence available suggest that parvalbumin co-
sediments with isinglass and is largely removed from the bulk of the beer. No parvalbumin 
can be detected in beer, even when the isinglass dose levels are substantially higher than 
typical commercial rates. Theoretical calculations indicate that even in a worst case Page 25 of 26 
 
scenario the amount of parvalbumin which could be consumed in a few hours even by a 
heavy drinker of beer is in the order of 0.1-0.2 µg.  
Repeated literature searches confirm that there have been no published reports of  
allergic reactions which could be attributed to isinglass or parvalbumin in beer. An oral 
challenge trial reported in the literature, using wine fined with isinglass, also showed  
no allergic responses amongst fish-allergic subjects.   
Clinical trials were carried out in order to define the allergenic status of isinglass. These 
trials included both skin prick tests, using extracts of fish flesh and swim bladders, and oral 
challenge tests, using isinglass administered at high rates. 
The doses of isinglass administered are equivalent to extremely high rates of beer 
consumption. In total twenty-one patients were tested (15 using the FARRP protocol and 6 
using the Rancé protocols). No subjects displayed any objective allergic responses on 
ingestion of very high levels of isinglass.   
In conclusion, the scientific and clinical evidence available indicates that drinking  
beer fined with isinglass does not elicit allergic reactions in fish sensitive individuals.   
It also seems highly likely that the use of isinglass in wine production, which uses the same 
isinglass products as used in beer, with wine being similarly clarified by filtration, is also 
not very likely to pose a risk of allergic reaction in susceptible individuals

Re: TTB‐2025‐0003: Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The French Federation of Wine and Spirits Exporters (FEVS), appreciates the opportunity to submit comments 
on Notice No. 238 relative to Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FEVS is the trade association representing the wine and spirit exporting companies of France. FEVS's 
membership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with 
exports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for 
French wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). 
 
FEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American 
consumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and 
quality of the wines and spirits they purchase. 
 
Therefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on the TTB’s proposed rulemaking. 
 
 
On allergen labelling for distilled spirits 
 
FEVS warmly welcomes the proposed approach taken by TTB not to require allergen labelling for distilled 
spirits. This rightly acknowledges the fact that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in a product which 
has been going through a distillation process. It also ensures coherence with the approach already adopted 
by TTB regarding the gluten-free labelling of distilled products. 
 
 
On processing aids and fining agents 
 
FEVS appreciates the possibility for isinglass and fish gelatin, which could be used as fining agents in the 
wine production process, to only label “fish” as the name of the allergen, without being required to indicate 
the fish species used to make the product. 
 
Nevertheless, FEVS would like to share concerns about the proposal made by TTB to require the disclosure 
of processing aids derived from major food allergens on label . As rightly pointed out in the Notice,  this 
proposal should negatively impact wine products since albumen, isinglass or casein are usually used as fining 
and/or clarifying agents for wines. 
 
2 
All of the nine substances considered as “major food allergen” under TTB proposed Notice (with the 
exception of soybean which  is subject to lesser standards ) are part of a list of food or ingredients which, 
according to Codex Alimentarius 1, “shall always be declared as allergenic food using the specified name in 
addition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food” (bold added). 
 
This has to be read in conjunction with the Codex definition of a processing aid
2 which is “ a substance or 
material, not including apparatus or utensils, and not consumed as a food ingredient by itself, intentionally 
used in the processing of raw materials, foods or its ingredients, to fulfil a certain technological purpose during 
treatment or processing and which may result in the non‐intentional but unavoidable presence of residues 
or derivatives in the final product” (bold added). 
 
In addition, most of the operators using fining or clarifying agents  proceed to filtration of their wine before 
bottling to ensure the limpidity of the product as well as the complete removal of any allergenic substance, 
in line with good manufacturing practices. 
 
While acknowledging the necessity to rightly inform consumers on the presence of all allergens derived from 
major food allergens in the final product, FEVS kindly requests TTB not to require the labelling of processing 
aid when producers have followed good manufacturing practices and/or international standards relating to 
the management of allergen in the food production process, such as the Codex Alimentarius Code of practice 
on food allergen management for food business operators (see here) or the OIV Code of good fining practices 
for wine to be applied in the use of proteinaceous wine fining agents with allergenic potential (casein and egg 
white) (see here). 
 
Adopting a diverging approach from international standards could lead to the creation of access market 
barriers, not only for foreign operators willing to export their products to the US but also for US producers 
exporting their wines to foreign markets. For instance, according to EU harmonized rules, all food products, 
including alcoholic beverages, put on the EU market have to indicate  “any ingredient or processing aid (…) 
used in the manufacture or preparation of a food and still present in the finished product, even if in an altered 
form”
3 (bold added). 
 
 
On the wording of the labeling statement and other mandatory disclosures 
 
FEVS encourages TTB to require the use of the terms “ Contains” (followed by a colon and the name of the 
food source from which each major food allergen is derived) rather than “Contains Major Food Allergens”. 
 
As long as only some allergens would fall under a compulsory requirement of disclosure for alcoholic 
beverages, FEVS does not consider such indication would be confusing or misleading for US consumers. 
 
On the contrary, adopting the terms “ Contains” would increase the legibility  and understandability of the 
alcoholic beverages label for US consumers by using  the same terms as those already required  for other 
health-sensitive ingredients (FD&C Yellow No.5, carmine…) when used in spirits or wine products , including 
allergen like sulfites which is present and labelled in the overwhelming majority of wines sold on the US 
market. 
 
This approach would also build on consumers’ habits and purchasing behaviors by ensuring consistency with: 
- current commercial practices used by alcoholic beverages operators who voluntarily label major food 
allergens according to the 2006 TTB Interim rules, 
- alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA and FALCPA rules, 
- other food products sold on the US market. 
 
1 See Point 4.2.1.4 of the General Standard for the labelling of pre -packaged foods CXS 1 -1985: “4.2.1.4 The following foods and 
ingredients are known to trigger food allergy or coeliac disease and shall always be declared as allergenic foods using the specified 
name in addition to or as part of the ingredient name when intentionally present in the food:” 
2 See Point 2 « Deﬁnitions » of the General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods CXS 1-1985 
3 See article 9.1 (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers 3 
In addition, requiring the use of the terms “ Contains” will guarantee the alignment of US rules for alcoholic 
beverages with international standards applying to all food products, as agreed in the 2024 revised Codex 
Alimentarius General Standard for the labelling of pre-packaged foods4. 
 
This would be of great importance, for economic operators as well as US consumers, considering the growing 
number of countries across the world which require to label either the full list of ingredients (as it is the case 
in the EU for wine products) or, at least, allergens on alcoholic beverages packaging  (as it is the case in the 
EU for all alcoholic beverages). 
 
For the same reason, and in line with our preference for using the terms “Contains”, FEVS would welcome 
the possibility for operators to choose how to label major food allergen s on their packaging either by a 
specific “Contains” statement or by their inclusion within a list of ingredients . This will allow operators to 
rightly inform consumers without having to change their packaging whatever the TTB will ultimately decide 
regarding ingredient listing for alcoholic beverages (see Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237 ), but also 
when providing the list of ingredients on a voluntary basis according to US currently applying rules. 
 
It's also the reason why FEVS requests TTB not to mandate specific placement, type size or presentation 
requirements for the indication of major food allergens beyond what it is already required for the sulfites 
statement. This should include the possibility for operators either to make two separate statements (one for 
the food major allergen, the other one for sulfites) or to gather all of them  in one single statement, as long 
as legibility requirements are fulfilled.  
 
All the above elements will also enable operators to manage the limited space available on label to include 
such requirements, while ensuring clear, not misleading and accurate information to US consumers. 
 
 
On the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations 
 
FEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion of a statement of major food allergens. 
 
In addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to 
put on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force 
of any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. 
 
Last but not least, if TTB decides to adopt a final rule on Alcohol Fact Statements for alcoholic beverage (as 
envisaged in Notice of proposed rulemaking No. 237), FEVS ask s for an identical date of entry into force 
for both regulations. This will prevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost 
this approach could have for them, especially considering the overwhelming majority of SMEs in the sector.

statement shall commence with the word ‘contains’ (or equivalent word) and be placed directly under or in close proximity to the 
list of ingredients when present” ",0,-1,"[-1, 4, 5]",-1,4,5,neutral,0.9979788661003113,"{'admiration': 7.610359170939773e-05, 'amusement': 5.419224180513993e-05, 'anger': 6.621643115067855e-05, 'annoyance': 0.00021353796182665974, 'approval': 0.0004759485018439591, 'caring': 3.5382749047130346e-05, 'confusion': 8.781911310506985e-05, 'curiosity': 5.1897593948524445e-05, 'desire': 3.952003316953778e-05, 'disappointment': 0.00010376406135037541, 'disapproval': 0.00012652453733608127, 'disgust': 5.9150555898668244e-05, 'embarrassment': 1.9341496226843446e-05, 'excitement': 5.110805432195775e-05, 'fear': 3.807682514889166e-05, 'gratitude': 2.9198581614764407e-05, 'grief': 1.2631180652533658e-05, 'joy': 4.618813545675948e-05, 'love': 3.5845921956934035e-05, 'nervousness': 1.0624638889566995e-05, 'optimism': 6.747377483407035e-05, 'pride': 9.187460818793625e-06, 'realization': 0.0001953498285729438, 'relief': 1.0310990546713583e-05, 'remorse': 1.2613495528057683e-05, 'sadness': 6.883534661028534e-05, 'surprise': 2.4277749616885558e-05, 'neutral': 0.9979788661003113}"

COMMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING NOTIFICATION  
G/TBT/N/USA/2183 and G/TBT/N/USA/2182 
Allergen and Nutrition Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
The European Union (EU) would like to thank the authorities of the United States 
of America for providing the opportunity to comment on the draft “ Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ”, notified on 22 
January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2183.  
The mandatory labelling of ‘Major Food Allergen’ referred to in the US proposed 
rulemaking includes fish ingredients. The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required 
when the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify 
wines and beers. 
At a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the 
exposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert 
Committee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the 
European Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an 
established history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the 
reference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of 
exposure for derivative safety assessment. 
The EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or 
fish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen 
labelling. 
As regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, 
the EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines 
on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-
2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars 
included in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  
such as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to 
highlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory 
indication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, 
contrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated 
on traded alcoholic beverages. 
Finally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed 
5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the 
operators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before 
the proposed rule comes into effect.

The EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comments could be taken into 
account and replied to before adoption of the notified draft.

**Subject: Public Health Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Alcohol Labeling Transparency**

Dear TTB,

As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 238. I strongly support TTB’s efforts to modernize and improve the transparency of malt beverage labeling. Accurate, standardized, and easily accessible labeling is critical for informing consumer decisions and reducing alcohol-related harms.

However, I am concerned that the proposed reliance on **QR codes** as a means of conveying essential product information—such as ingredients, nutritional content, and allergens—is inadequate from a public health standpoint.

**Key Public Health Concerns with the QR Code Approach:**

1. **Limited Access and Equity**: Not all consumers have smartphones, reliable internet access, or the technological literacy to use QR codes. This disproportionately affects older adults, lower-income populations, and rural communities, creating inequitable access to vital health information.
2. **Reduced Transparency at Point of Purchase**: Important health information should be immediately visible to consumers when they are making purchasing decisions. Relegating this data to a QR code discourages real-time engagement and undermines informed choice.
3. **Inconsistent Use by Industry**: Without mandatory formatting and content requirements, the use of QR codes could become inconsistent across brands, further confusing consumers and limiting usefulness.
4. **Consumer Expectation of On-Label Information**: Unlike most other packaged food and beverages, alcohol products are still not required to provide basic nutritional or ingredient data directly on the label. Continuing this practice via QR codes perpetuates a harmful double standard.

**Recommendations:**

To align alcohol labeling with broader public health goals, I respectfully urge the TTB to:

* Require **on-label disclosure** of key information: alcohol by volume (ABV), ingredient lists, common allergens, calories per serving, and nutritional information.
* Limit the use of QR codes to **supplemental information only**, not as a substitute for on-label transparency.
* Establish **mandatory labeling standards** across the alcohol industry to promote consistency and prevent consumer confusion.

Consumers deserve to know exactly what they’re consuming—clearly, consistently, and equitably. Thank you for considering this public health perspective.

Comment on TTB Notice No. 238 – Proposed Revisions to Malt Beverage Labeling 
and Advertising Regulations
Subject: Public Health Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Alcohol 
Labeling Transparency
Dear TTB,
As a public health advocate, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 238. 
I strongly support TTB’s efforts to modernize and improve the transparency of malt 
beverage labeling. Accurate, standardized, and easily accessible labeling is critical for 
informing consumer decisions and reducing alcohol-related harms.
However, I am concerned that the proposed reliance on QR codes as a means of 
conveying essential product information—such as ingredients, nutritional content, and 
allergens—is inadequate from a public health standpoint.
Key Public Health Concerns with the QR Code Approach:
1.Limited Access and Equity: Not all consumers have smartphones, reliable 
internet access, or the technological literacy to use QR codes. This 
disproportionately affects older adults, lower-income populations, and rural 
communities, creating inequitable access to vital health information.
2.Reduced Transparency at Point of Purchase: Important health information 
should be immediately visible to consumers when they are making purchasing 
decisions. Relegating this data to a QR code discourages real-time engagement 
and undermines informed choice.
3.Inconsistent Use by Industry: Without mandatory formatting and content 
requirements, the use of QR codes could become inconsistent across brands, 
further confusing consumers and limiting usefulness.
4.Consumer Expectation of On-Label Information: Unlike most other packaged 
food and beverages, alcohol products are still not required to provide basic 
nutritional or ingredient data directly on the label. Continuing this practice via QR 
codes perpetuates a harmful double standard.
Recommendations:
To align alcohol labeling with broader public health goals, I respectfully urge the TTB to:
•Require on-label disclosure of key information: alcohol by volume (ABV), 
ingredient lists, common allergens, calories per serving, and nutritional 
information.2
•Limit the use of QR codes to supplemental information only, not as a 
substitute for on-label transparency.
•Establish mandatory labeling standards across the alcohol industry to promote 
consistency and prevent consumer confusion.
Consumers deserve to know exactly what they’re consuming—clearly, consistently, and 
equitably. Thank you for considering this public health perspective.

RE Notice No.os 237 & 238 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages; and Major Food
Allergen Labeling for Wineso Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages
Comments of the Kentuckv Distillers' Association
Dear Director,
We are outside counsel for the Kentucky Distillers' Association, located in
Frankfort, Kentucky (""KDA""). The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits
producers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and
its membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on
potential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.
While the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two
notices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit
comments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise
similar concerns for Kentucky's spirits industry. Please accept the following as the
KDA's comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket
TTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to
require the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of
distilled spirits.
Since the KDA's founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and
responsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky's signature Bourbon and Distilled
Spirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world's
supply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As
such, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and
administrative impact on our members.

1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers
The KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs
associated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft
producers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to
distilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff
and capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be
an expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping
units (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued
testing would be cost prohibitive.
It is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated
to be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits
labels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic
and logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive
packaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real
estate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them
ignore key labeling information altogether.
2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion
The proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces
redundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by
volume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the
requirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further
by requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,
which will result in customer confusion.
Customers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being
quantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on
the Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of
alcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or
misinterpret the label entirely.
Further, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes
proteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed
Alcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in
the product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer
would reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that
there are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.

The KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due
to the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.
3. Digital Labeling Options
Spirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As
discussed, to keep consumers' attention and give them the ability to learn more about
certain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such
an approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy
'click through' for the latest and more in-depth product information.
Moreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for
printing new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant
environmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost
ninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for
helping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less
environmental effects.
4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process
As TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -
including gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a
proper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled
spirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the
exception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled
spirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced
post-distillation.
The KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption
regarding TTB's testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-
case basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself
by requiring lab analysis of every product.
If the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final
rulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due
to the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation
product. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause
tremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be
'gluten-free' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about
gluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill
information or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.
Including more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI

potential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential
customers.
5. Conclusion
As TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to
consider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations
that consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and
other spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are
already well-educated about distilled spirits products. Adding more could create nothing
more than confusion and indifference, all while adding burdensome costs and testing
inefficiencies.

Notification G/TBT/N/USA/2183 
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Introduction 
spiritsEUROPE represents the interests of the European distilled spirits industry. Our members include 
31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base 
in Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion 
in 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United 
States. 
 
We would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Major Food Allergen Labeling 
for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ” to the WTO TBT Committee . We welcome the 
opportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if 
needed.  
 
I. Comments on “Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages” 
 
spiritsEUROPE very much welcomes the approach taken by TTB on allergens labelling for distilled 
spirits. As the Notice rightly points out, the production of spirits involves the distillation of raw 
materials in such a way that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the distilled product or 
distilled ingredient. It is therefore appropriate that the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply 
to major food allergens used before the distillation process. 
 
We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing protein are added 
to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food allergens are listed on the label. 
 
For those products where the presence of allergens would have to be disclosed , spiritsEUROPE  
welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. In addition, we  would like to request the 
possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before the proposed 
rule comes into effect. 
 
Finally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking  Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into 
force is aligned with that of  Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.

This letter presents comments of the National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB)' on the Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
(TTB) Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed rules cited above. NFIB finds it
hard to understand why the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management
and Budget continue to pursue these Biden Administration proposals that would place
heavy and unwarranted burdens on the small businesses of America in the beer, wine,
and spirits industry. NFIB recommends and requests that the Treasury Department
withdraw both Biden proposals.

1. The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses
That Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust

Census Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that
small businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the
beer, wine, and spirits industry:

Line of Number of Firms That Had

Business Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage
Breweries 3,214 2,609 81%
Wineries 3,576 2,975 83%
Distilleries 760 659 86%

In the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and
Spirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than
6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.
The report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the
number of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has

grown dramatically but still occupies only a small share of the market.’ Thus, the
Government's own data makes clear that, when the Treasury Department aims new
labeling requirements at the beer, wine, and spirits industry, it hits primarily small
businesses.5 The two Biden-proposed rules fail to recognize the practicalities of
running small businesses and fail to make the adjustments for small businesses that the
congressional policy stated in the Regulatory Flexibility Act contemplates.®

Small businesses, unlike the corporate behemoths in the beer, wine, and spirits industry
whose names and fortunes most everyone knows, cannot afford the bevy of lawyers
and experts necessary to decipher the rules and physically implement them, let alone
afford the cost of changes in processing and machinery to accommodate them.
Regulatory compliance costs small business owners time and money, both of which are
generally in short supply as they strive to keep their small businesses going, meet their
customers’ needs, and create jobs. The Biden-proposed rules would impose
unaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive
barrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in
the industry who can.

The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
fail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared
that “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities
has in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,

§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,
sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,
differing views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,
moral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these
questions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and
spirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound
science and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.
NFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits
have available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage
environments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out
to Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-
alcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the
guidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at
https:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-

discouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress
also noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated
businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to
inefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some
cases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental
and economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules
simply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately
dismisses it.®

President Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the
country’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:

My Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built
on common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators
first. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade
practices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°

To help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting
red tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

2. TTB Did Not Get the President's Deregula’ Message

President Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they
should seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.

On January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days
after TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule
and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order
14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The
ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on
the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic
growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He
also said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private

8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB
considered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is
not proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of
the proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who
are allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a
permanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage
labels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such
products.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all
pseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to
combat.

® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).
expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic
prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”
He emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate
unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°

On February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring
Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government
Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should
identify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that
impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”
and “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private
enterprise and entrepreneurship.”*'

On April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-
Competitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not
predetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that
reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they
create for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed
agency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...
distortions on the operation of a free market.”!2

These are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though
improperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive
Suggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,
issued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.

To comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the
quoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-
proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the
Department of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to
the specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head
of TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that
unreasonably burden small and other businesses.

3. These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record

TTB says'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a
recommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in
the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits '4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a
February 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)'®
joined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or
together, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-
proposed rules.

Regarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes'® the Executive Summary at
the front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,
such as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been
implemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB
should revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory
information on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In
between the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the
report, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the
recommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by
commenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report
recommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the
recommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient
labeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes. It was
therefore misleading for TTB to state in the preamble to the Biden-proposed Allergen

with the Competition Report's recommendations[.]’2°

The CSPI letter of February 24, 2021, represented the view of seven organizations that
exist to advocate particular views, in this case not favorable to the beer, wine, and
spirits industry: CSPI, Alcohol Justice, American Institute for Cancer Research,
Consumer Federation of America, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, National
Consumers League, and U.S. Aicohol Policy Alliance. Advocacy to the federal and
state governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by
the First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state
constitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a
complete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.

4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails
Legal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Allergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue
the rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the
benefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department allergen labeling authority. The Treasury Department claims authority to
impose the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act.22 The current absence of labeling about major allergens by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only

no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.”); NFIB v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

2 27 U.S.C. 205(e). The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of
title 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.
205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,
to provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the
product, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the
authority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,
analyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the
case of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the
State into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at
5764, col. 1.
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major
allergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements
of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep
(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things
that are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or
importer -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,
applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that
Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”
unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen
labeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue
the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.

Second, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains
Major Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in
fact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that
TTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits
with its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech
that is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,
distilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in
the production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major
allergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the
allergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility
in exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if
the allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°
If an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but

none of the allergen in the process ends up in the final product -- confirmed, if
necessary, by appropriate analysis of periodic test samples?’ -- the rule should not
require a label stating that the bottle “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” just because a
major allergen was used at some point in the production process.”

Third, TTB failed to calculate the costs of compliance of the Biden-proposed Allergen
Labeling Rule. To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:

... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the
cost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry
members would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the
Alcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new
allergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just
one label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°

The TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business
assuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling
Rule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal
duty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and
must consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°
TTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes
of the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a
final Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not
an Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,
but not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to
comply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603

Given the serious shortcomings of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule, the
Treasury Department should withdraw the proposed rule.

5. The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails
Legal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements

In addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the
rule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and
Executive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by
law.

First, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law
conferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury
Department authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury
Department claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)
chapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)
section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant
the authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration
proposed.

Of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only
three provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)
REQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the
revenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits
issued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,
sale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5
wine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section
5368 provides:

(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and
gauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such
manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).

22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has
no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until
Congress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)
(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that
Congress has provided."").

33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.
1

(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,
vehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with
this chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.

Section 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or
sale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled
in such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be
removed from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled
spirits plants under section 5222.”

The three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.
Section 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for
distilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.
Section 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the
comparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different
from marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to
impose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of
labeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also
that the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to
labeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the
Internal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by
volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412
grants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.
Accordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue
Code to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or
beer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.

The Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by
the beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,
misleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,
obscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only
provision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol
Facts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).

Section 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations
for bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with
adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content
thereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements

34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in
one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that
Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).
12

of, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and
except that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for
wines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the
canon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the
requirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,
alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving
size, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.
Also, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes
that Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic
significance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant
alcohol facts labeling authority.

The Treasury Department's triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for
Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2
(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which
it can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide
consumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court
decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.
Circuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional
predecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,
there is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates
Congress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient
disclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of
discretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,
as necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with
that congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the
agency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,
104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme
Court rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which
the Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its

3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were
defined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to
authorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.

meaning. The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their
independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory
authority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9

So, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed
Alcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that
leaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.
Congress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when
it wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”

Second, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little
benefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost
the industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement
(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent
years for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has
no reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to
purchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without
admitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them
to purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling
requirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they
otherwise would have faced.

As for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of
alcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to
quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in
the absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”
assuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.
In the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts
Rule:

TTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but
as stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide
consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of
alcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice

about moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional
information about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.

The first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a
thread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts
labeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would
mean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but
carbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.
Also, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery
store), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in
a bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it
might be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts
label diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with
respect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the
Alcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to
compare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a
higher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should
take human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on
assumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.

The second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will
provide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient
content of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the
proposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing
the additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the
labeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the
labeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.

For the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule
greatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.

Thirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-
proposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”

4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information
requirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per
container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of
legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in
a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better
for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who
are pregnant.”).

47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or
any other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a
notice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United
15

TTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5
“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And
immediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
But that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to
the proposed rules.

n

The data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises
(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in
this case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the
proposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account
of recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is
$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298
per year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the
Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making
about $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed
charge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.

Particularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its
decision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities:

The production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an
industry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and
advertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding
more elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant
impact on the regulated industry.°!

The TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding
more labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential
policy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.

NFIB recommends and requests that the Department of the Treasury withdraw the rules
on Allergen Labeling and Alcohol Facts proposed by the Biden Administration three
days before he left office. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the
Department of the Treasury has no legal authority to promulgate the Biden-proposed
rules and failed to provide the regulatory analyses required in proposing the rules. And
the proposed rules run flatly contrary to the deregulatory policies President Trump has
established by executive order. Withdrawal of the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling
and Alcohol Facts rules will prevent imposition of unwarranted, burdensome, and costly
rules on small businesses in the beer, wine, and spirits industry.

Consumers with food allergies have no way of knowing if they can safely consume alcoholic beverages because neither ingredient lists, nor major allergen labeling is required.<br/>Nearly all foods and beverages we consume are required to have basic labeling of ingredients and allergens. Alcohol shouldn&rsquo;t be exempt!I commend TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and protect consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the top 9 major food allergens that does not exempt processing aids. The rule could be strengthened by specifying where the allergen disclosure should appear, outlining specific formatting requirements, and requiring species specific disclosure for the labeling of fin fish. <br/>TTB should make clear in the final rule that this information should never be provided solely via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology <br/>Consumers need this information as soon as possible! In the final rule, TTB should shorten the compliance period from 5 years to 3.5 years to prevent further delay of consumer access to this basic safety information.<br/>In summary. please label alcoholic products with information about possible food allergens to protect public health.<br/>Thank you for your consideration to this important topic.<br/>",0,2,"[2, -1, -1]",2,-1,-1,gratitude,0.8173725008964539,"{'admiration': 0.01603970304131508, 'amusement': 0.0001734206744004041, 'anger': 0.00022130976140033454, 'annoyance': 0.002094847150146961, 'approval': 0.05573849380016327, 'caring': 0.0027371617034077644, 'confusion': 0.0007349307998083532, 'curiosity': 0.0002513498184271157, 'desire': 0.0006222954834811389, 'disappointment': 0.000936433207243681, 'disapproval': 0.0049297017976641655, 'disgust': 0.00039940388523973525, 'embarrassment': 0.00019021918706130236, 'excitement': 0.0004522344097495079, 'fear': 0.0002037382364505902, 'gratitude': 0.8173725008964539, 'grief': 0.0001568822917761281, 'joy': 0.0005126192700117826, 'love': 0.00024801099789328873, 'nervousness': 0.00010087311966344714, 'optimism': 0.003326390404254198, 'pride': 0.000713564280886203, 'realization': 0.007318446412682533, 'relief': 0.0014238861622288823, 'remorse': 0.00042085739551112056, 'sadness': 0.0005339886411093175, 'surprise': 0.0001718846324365586, 'neutral': 0.0819748267531395}"

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA. We are dedicated to advancing evidence-based policies that promote public health and safety. We are writing in response to the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)’s request for comment on rulemaking around allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages (27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7; Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238).  We applaud TTB’s intention to improve the transparency and safety around alcoholic beverages. As a consumable product, alcohol is often unaccountably exempt from the consumer information requirements of other foods and beverages. This proposed rulemaking will close the gap.  Food allergies are not a rare condition. Approximately 11% of U.S. adults are estimated to have a food allergy (around 26 million), and 38.3% of those individuals have had an allergy-related emergency department visit.1 Of those with a food allergy, 90% are allergic to one of 9 major food types.2 Alcohol use is common in the United States, with 177.3 million residents ages 12 and up consuming alcohol in the past year. Depending on the nature of the alcohol product, many will very often contain one or more of the 9 major allergens (e.g., the grains used to make beer almost inevitably introduce wheat gluten to the finished product), while for others the presence of an allergen can be difficult to know for certain (e.g., distilled spirits) and in some cases un-anticipatable (e.g. the use of fish-derived products in wine production). Allergic events create a steady financial drain. In a systematic review of allergen economic impact studies, individual medical costs from allergen-related causes amount to an average of $2,081 per event, while household costs exceed an average of $8000 per event from out-of-pocket expenses and opportunity costs.3 As such, avoiding unexpected exposures to allergens in alcohol consumption could have a significant health and economic benefit to U.S. households.  To be most effective in addressing these concerns, the TTB rulemaking should err on the side of consistency across labels. That means minimizing the alternatives to the “Contains major food 
allergens” wording, even if said alternative wording is considered by the producer to be more emphatic. Consumers become accustomed to looking for allergen information in particular places with particular words. Along these same lines, the “minor” allergens should be consistently identified in the same place and same formatting as major ones. The warning should be high-visibility, including a minimum font size, restrictions on kerning and compressing, a mandated box, and contrasting background within that box.  We would advise against allowing allergen labeling exemptions for distilled products, because cross-contamination is a known and described phenomenon across food production. TTB could consider a warning akin to the “made in a facility that also processes” language commonly used in food product warnings, however it’s not clear that this complexity actually does producers a favor. It is less impactful to err towards an unnecessary label than to induce a medical event.  On-label warnings are an absolute requirement. QR codes are not universally sought out or employed, and the required access to the internet is not always available.4 Moreover, not all packaged alcohol will be consumed in circumstances where the consumer will be expected to have mobile device with them. Allergen information should be as available beachside as it is in the grocery store, and the only way to ensure this is to include the information directly on the packaging.   As a final note—we join with the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and other groups in urging TTB to require full ingredient labeling for all products. While the allergen warnings are important to prevent acute medical events, there are many other reasons to avoid or seek out certain ingredients, including ethical and religious grounds. We also support CSPI’s request for an accelerated, 3.5–year timeline—the concerns from industry in ramping up the testing for products should be offset by the acclimation time required by the public to begin reflexively seeking allergen information on the labels.   We thank TTB for their long-term effort in developing and promulgating these new guidelines. Alcohol Justice is available at the Bureau’s request for any further information or context to help bring this rulemaking to fruition.     Respectfully,

To Whom It May Concern, 
 
GS1 US appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau's (TTB) proposal to require disclosure of major food allergens used in the production 
of alcohol beverages. As an organization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US 
understands the importance of leveraging data and technology to improve transparency and 
enhance consumer access to detailed product information that supports informed decision making. 
We commend TTB’s commitment to these goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute 
our insights. 
 
For over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver 
safe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC 
barcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners 
identify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions 
of businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 
members across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage 
production, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. 
 
As a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify 
industry challenges and to build consensus on best practices for solving them using global 
standards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global 
standards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards 
help empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access 
to the information they want and need about those products. 
 
2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Allergen Labeling 
GS1 US acknowledges the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with 
essential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, 
particularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid 
in achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as UPC barcodes, can only hold a limited 
amount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of 
storing much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates,

and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing comprehensive 
information in a compact format. 
 
The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and consumer value of 
digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform launched in 2015 to 
provide detailed product information via QR codes. Incorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global 
Trade Item Number (GTIN) can effectively support consumer access to allergen information. This 
approach promotes consumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. 
Additionally, 2D barcodes can serve as a valuable complement to the information required to 
appear on the physical label.  Besides the required on-pack disclosures, 2D barcodes provide a 
pathway to more detailed information, such as ingredient lists, sustainability practices, and 
responsible consumption messaging, enhancing transparency for consumers. 
 
A GS1 Digital Link-enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and 
allergen information, including dynamic data including recalls or safety alerts, through a simple 
smartphone scan. The GS1 Digital Link standard enhances the power and flexibility of GS1 
identifiers by integrating them into the web. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into 
gateways to consumer information, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand 
loyalty while improving supply chain traceability. 
 
Moreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up label space. 
QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater capacity for 
information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing comprehensive data. 
Furthermore, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already familiar with 
scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American adults use 
smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said they would scan a QR code to access 
product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers consumers to 
easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. 
 
In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and allergen information, 2D barcodes 
encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and interoperable format, ensuring accuracy 
and consistency across retail and digital platforms. Including the GTIN in a QR code encoded with 
GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product information.  
 
Application of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information 
GS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification 
and efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open, global standards can 
significantly enhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be 
applied to support industry compliance with allergen labeling requirements: 
 
1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, 
parties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the 
manufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to 
recognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information.

2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies 
such as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical 
information like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate 
capture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. 
3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data 
formats allows for seamless information exchange across the supply chain. This 
transparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their 
confidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by 
facilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. 
 
Conclusion 
Incorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN for product identification, 2D barcodes, and 
GS1 Digital Link into the TTB’s allergen labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance 
consumer access to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only enable industry 
stakeholders to efficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future 
advancements in the digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively 
with TTB, industry partners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of 
this important initiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the 
opportunity to contribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol 
beverage products.

  INTRODUCTION   Almost  two  decades  ago,  TTB  issued  an  interim  rule  addressing  voluntary  labeling  of  major  food  
allergens.
 
Some
 
craft
 
spirits
 
producers
 
followed
 
suit
 
and
 
began
 
adding
 
additional
 
information
 
for
 
the
 
consumer.
  
TTB’s
 
current
 
proposal,
 
which
 
seeks
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
voluntary
 
program
 
mandatory,
 
is
 
generally
 
accepted
 
by
 
the
 
American
 
Craft
 
Spirits
 
Association
 
(ACSA)
 
for
 
the
 
reasons
 
set
 
forth
 
below.
  
If
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
to
 
notice
 
the
 
consumer
 
of
 
ingredients
 
most
 
often
 
associated
 
with
 
food
 
allergies,
 
however,
 
ACSA
 
suggests
 
an
 
approach
 
led
 
by
 
“The
 
simpler
 
the
 
better”.
  
  
Allergen  Statements  
A.  Labeling  of  Major  Food  Allergens  and  other  Mandatory  Disclosures   
1  
1.  Wording  of  the  Labeling  Statement  and  Other  Mandatory  Disclosures  
 
1.1.  Should  TTB  adopt  the  proposed  wording  of  the  major  food  allergen  
statement
 
(""Contains
 
major
 
food
 
allergen(s)""
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
colon
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived)?
 
Alternately,
 
should
 
TTB
 
require
 
or
 
allow
 
alternative
 
formats,
 
including
 
the
 
following:
 
 
1.1.1.  ""Contains""  followed  by  a  colon  and  the  name  of  the  food  source  
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived;
 
or
 
 
1.1.2.  A  heading  such  as  ""Major  Food  Allergen  Information""  followed  by  
""Contains:""
 
or
 
other
 
language
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived.
 
All  of  these  options  effectively  communicate  the  desired  information.  We  
encourage
 
TTB
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
briefer
 
options,
 
such
 
as
 
“Contains:
 
Nuts”
 
A  consumer  who  needs  this  information  will  know  what  to  do  with  it.  They  don’t  
need
 
to
 
be
 
told
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
major
 
allergen
 
information-
 
they
 
know
 
they’re
 
allergic
 
to
 
nuts.
 
1.2.  Should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  food  allergens  within  a  voluntary  
ingredient
 
statement
 
on
 
labels
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
 
 
Yes.
 
1.3.  If  mandatory  ingredient  labeling  is  ultimately  adopted,  should  TTB  allow  the  
inclusion
 
of
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
ingredients
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
If
 
mandatory
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
is
 
ultimately
 
adopted,
 
should
 
TTB
 
use
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA’s
 
approach?
 
Should
 
TTB
 
limit
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
only
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
 
 
Yes,
 
if
 
the
 
information
 
is
 
communicated.
 
1.4.  Should  other  ingredients  that  are  required  to  be  disclosed  under  current  
TTB
 
regulations
 
(FD&C
 
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
one
 
statement
 
on
 
the
 
label?
 
If
 
so,
 
should
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
a
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
that
 
includes
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
(For
 
example,
 
""Contains
 
egg
 
and
 
sulfites"").
 
Or
 
should
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
be
 
identified
 
as
 
such,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
listed
 
separately
 
(for
 
example,
 
""Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg.
 
Contains
 
sulfites"")?
 
Should
 
another
 
statement
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
ingredients
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
under
 
current
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
2  (FD&C  Yellow  No.  5,  cochineal  extract  or  carmine,  sulfites,  and  aspartame)  
to
 
differentiate
 
from
 
the
 
""Contains""
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
 
 
All
 
required
 
disclosure
 
of
 
ingredients
 
should
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
for
 
simplicity.
 
1.5.  Would  requiring  all  mandatory  disclosures  to  be  in  one  place  on  the  label,  
including
 
the
 
proposed
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement,
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
information?
 
Would
 
such
 
a
 
requirement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry
 
members
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
allowing
 
the
 
mandatory
 
disclosures
 
to
 
appear
 
separately?
 
 
 
All
 
required
 
disclosure
 
of
 
ingredients
 
should
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
for
 
simplicity.
 
1.6.  Should  TTB  mandate  specific  placement,  type  size,  and  presentation  
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
statements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
requirements
 
already
 
applicable
 
to
 
all
 
mandatory
 
information
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels?
 
For
 
example,
 
should
 
the
 
required
 
allergen
 
disclosure
 
statement
 
be
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
Or,
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
practicable,
 
should
 
TTB
 
mandate
 
formatting
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA
 
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling?
 
 
 
TTB
 
should
 
keep
 
the
 
requirements
 
consistent
 
with
 
those
 
already
 
existing
 
for
 
other
 
mandatory
 
information.
 
Minimum
 
type
 
size
 
and
 
legibility
 
requirements
 
have
 
been
 
sufficient
 
to
 
communicate
 
alcohol
 
content-
 
we
 
see
 
no
 
reason
 
they
 
wouldn’t
 
be
 
sufficient
 
in
 
this
 
case.
 
A
 
box
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
required.
  2.  Definition  of  Major  Food  Allergen  
 2.1.  N/A  
 3.  Labeling  of  Fish  Species  
 3.1.  TTB  solicits  comments  on  whether  labeling  alcohol  beverages  produced  
using
 
finfish
 
protein
 
merely
 
as
 
containing
 
""fish,""
 
rather
 
than
 
with
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
fish
 
species,
 
provides
 
adequate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
there
 
are
 
alternative
 
approaches
 
to
 
this
 
issue
 
that
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
regarding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
finfish
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages.
 
 
 
“Fish”
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient.
 
 4.  Processing  and  Fining  Agents  
 
3  4.1.  TTB  is  proposing  to  require  the  disclosure  of  fining  or  processing  agents  
that
 
are
 
or
 
contain
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
with
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
including
 
the
 
added
 
parenthetical
 
""(processing
 
aid)""
 
and
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
this
 
proposal.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
egg
 
whites
 
are
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
processing
 
aid
 
for
 
wine,
 
the
 
industry
 
member
 
has
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
disclosing
 
this
 
on
 
the
 
label
 
as
 
follows:
 
""Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg
 
(processing
 
aid).""
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
option
 
that
 
industry
 
members
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
use,
 
but
 
they
 
also
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
list
 
these
 
agents
 
without
 
the
 
parenthetical.
 
TTB
 
is
 
not
 
proposing
 
parenthetical
 
statements
 
for
 
other
 
incidental
 
additives
 
besides
 
processing

 TTB  seeks  comments  on  whether  this  proposal,  which  is  generally  
consistent
 
with
 
FALCPA,
 
will
 
provide
 
adequate
 
information
 
to
 
consumers.
 
 
 
This
 
seems
 
sufficient.
 
 5.  Threshold  Levels  
 5.1.  N/A  
 6.  Allergen  Advisory  Labeling  
 6.1.  TTB’s  proposal  does  not  specifically  address  allergen  advisory  labeling,  
such
 
as
 
statements
 
that
 
a
 
product
 
may
 
contain
 
a
 
major
 
food
 
allergen,
 
e.g.,
 
""May
 
Contain
 
(major
 
food
 
allergen).""
 
TTB
 
is
 
concerned
 
that
 
allergen
 
advisory
 
labeling
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
adherence
 
to
 
current
 
good
 
manufacturing
 
practices
 
and
 
could
 
be
 
misleading.
 
TTB
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
allergen
 
advisory
 
labeling.
 
 
 
We
 
believe
 
TTB’s
 
requirements
 
should
 
be
 
aligned
 
with
 
those
 
for
 
food,
 
and
 
if
 
these
 
statements
 
on
 
food
 
do
 
not
 
undermine
 
GMP,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient
 
for
 
beverages.
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
aligning
 
with
 
food
 
labeling
 
practices,
 
TTB
 
should
 
allow
 
for
 
consumers
 
and
 
producers
 
some
 
leeway
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
best
 
decisions
 
for
 
themselves
 
here.
 
A
 
producer
 
may
 
wish
 
to
 
disclose,
 
out
 
of
 
an
 
overabundance
 
of
 
caution,
 
that
 
equipment
 
is
 
shared
 
between
 
products
 
that
 
do
 
and
 
products
 
that
 
do
 
not
 
contain
 
an
 
often
 
severe
 
allergen,
 
such
 
as
 
peanuts.
 
A
 
consumer
 
with
 
a
 
particularly
 
severe
 
allergy
 
may
 
wish
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
equipment
 
used
 
to
 
process
 
a
 
given
 
product
 
was
 
also
 
used
 
to
 
produce
 
a
 
product
 
containing
 
their
 
allergen.
 
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
pursuing
 
this
 
allergen
 
statement
 
requirement
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
mission
 
to
 
provide
 
consumers
 
important
 
information.
 
Why,
 
within
 
that
 
rule,
 
should
 
it
 
disallow
 
this
 
potentially
 
important
 
disclosure
 
of
 
allergen
 
information?
 
4   
ACSA
 
conducted
 
a
 
survey
 
of
 
its
 
members,
 
and
 
found
 
that
 
some
 
consumers
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
more
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
allergens
 
generally
 
considered
 
the
 
most
 
dangerous.
 
 29%  of  respondents  reported  that  consumers  had  asked  them  for  info  about  
allergen
 
content.
 
Of
 
these,
 
83%
 
reported
 
that
 
consumer
 
inquiries
 
focused
 
on
 
gluten
 
content,
 
while
 
11%
 
had
 
been
 
asked
 
about
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
“Big
 
9”
 
allergens
 
(milk,
 
eggs,
 
fish,
 
shellfish,
 
tree
 
nuts,
 
peanuts,
 
wheat,
 
soybeans,
 
and
 
sesame).
  Despite  most  inquiries  focusing  on  gluten,  whose  labeling  in  most  distilled  spirits  
produced
 
under
 
standard
 
practices
 
would
 
be
 
exempt
 
under
 
TTB’s
 
proposed
 
rules
 
in
 
this
 
NPRM,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
inquiries
 
about
 
the
 
Big
 
9
 
does
 
indicate
 
that
 
some
 
consumers
 
of
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
have
 
severe
 
allergies
 
to
 
major
 
allergens,
 
and
 
willing
 
distilleries
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
choose
 
to
 
indicate
 
their
 
presence
 
within
 
the
 
facility
 
if
 
they
 
choose
 
to
 
do
 
so.
  B.  Exceptions  1.  Exceptions  Found  in  Current  Regulations  
 1.1.  N/A  
 2.  Distillation  
 2.1.  TTB  is  proposing  to  amend  the  distilled  spirits  regulations  in  proposed  27  
CFR
 
5.75(b)(2)
 
to
 
specifically
 
provide
 
that
 
the
 
mandatory
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
do
 
not
 
apply
 
to
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
a
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
product
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
completely
 
distilled
 
in
 
such
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
no
 
protein
 
remains
 
in
 
the
 
distilled
 
spirits.
 
As
 
needed,
 
TTB
 
will
 
evaluate
 
compliance
 
by
 
verifying
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
distilled
 
component
 
using
 
scientifically
 
valid
 
analytical
 
methods
 
that
 
can
 
reliably
 
detect
 
the
 
presence
 
or
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
or
 
protein
 
fragments
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
If
 
ingredients
 
containing
 
protein
 
are
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
distilled
 
spirits
 
product
 
after
 
distillation,
 
and
 
no
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
are
 
listed
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
industry
 
members
 
must
 
be
 
prepared
 
to
 
substantiate,
 
upon
 
request,
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
protein
 
in
 
the
 
distillate,
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
any
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
added
 
ingredients,
 
and
 
the
 
precautions
 
taken
 
to
 
prevent
 
cross-contact.
 
 
 
TTB
 
is
 
soliciting
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
this
 
method
 
of
 
verifying
 
compliance
 
is
 
adequate
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
and
 
whether
 
there
 
are
 
better
 
alternatives.
 
  
ACSA
 
supports
 
TTB’s
 
proposal
 
to
 
not
 
require
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
in
 
spirits
 
that
 
use
 
those
 
allergen
 
proteins
 
only
 
pre-distillation.
 
 
5   
Yes,
 
testing
 
compliance
 
through
 
lab
 
analysis
 
on
 
an
 
as-needed
 
basis
 
is
 
sufficient.
 
 3.  Compliance  Date  
 3.1.  TTB  is  proposing  a  compliance  date  of  5  years  from  the  date  that  a  final  
rule
 
resulting
 
from
 
this
 
proposal
 
is
 
published
 
in
 
the
 
Federal
 
Register
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
burdens
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
new
 
labeling
 
information.
 
TTB
 
solicits
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
the
 
proposed
 
compliance
 
date
 
would
 
suffice
 
to
 
limit
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
small
 
businesses
 
and
 
to
 
reduce
 
overall
 
costs
 
of
 
compliance
 
while
 
ensuring
 
that
 
consumers
 
are
 
adequately
 
informed.
 
TTB
 
also
 
seeks
 
comments
 
on
 
whether
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
compliance
 
date
 
for
 
any
 
new
 
regulations
 
on
 
allergen,
 
ingredient,
 
or
 
""Alcohol
 
Facts""
 
labeling
 
would
 
provide
 
consumers
 
with
 
adequate
 
information
 
in
 
a
 
coherent
 
and
 
timely
 
manner
 
while
 
also
 
reducing
 
costs
 
and
 
other
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry.
 
 
 
If
 
the
 
additional
 
allergen
 
information
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
other
 
mandated
 
disclosures,
 
a
 
5
 
year
 
compliance
 
date
 
should
 
be
 
sufficient,
 
even
 
for
 
affected
 
small
 
businesses.
 
If
 
the
 
allergy
 
disclosure
 
is
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box,
 
or
 
requiring
 
significantly
 
larger
 
physical
 
space
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
burdensome.
 
Thank  you  for  consideration  of  ACSA’s  comments.   We  appreciate  the  ability  to  respond  and  are  
happy
 
to
 
answer
 
any
 
questions
 
you
 
may
 
have
 
upon
 
review.

Re: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Notice No. 
238; Docket No. TTB–2025–0003) (90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (January 17, 2025)) 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
On behalf of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), a national trade 
association representing the nation’s leading distillers of all sizes and marketers of distilled 
spirits sold in the United States, we appreciate the opportunity to comment upon the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) major food allergen labeling notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) and look forward to a thoughtful evaluation by TTB as you consider 
regulations on this important labeling proposal. 
 
As regulated producers, importers, and marketers of distilled spirits, we share the goal of TTB 
and the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act of providing consumers with meaningful 
information about the beverages they choose to purchase, especially when it pertains to 
allergenic material that could be present in the ﬁnal product. Consumers deserve labeling 
statements that provide information that an individual with allergies can rely upon when 
making food choices. Scientiﬁcally-based major food allergen labeling—like the voluntary 
program that properly identiﬁes products containing allergenic protein capable of causing an 
adverse reaction—can provide beneﬁcial information to consumers with food allergies.  
 
DISCUS members wholly support allergen labeling for distilled spirits products and are currently 
utilizing the aforementioned voluntary allergen labeling scheme to inform consumers about 
certain products in their portfolios that might contain major food allergens. For the reasons 
detailed below, our comment for the current NPRM focuses on the following points of 
consideration: 
 
A. The Major Food Allergen Statement Should Maintain the Current Phrasing and Structure 
B. Inclusion of Major Food Allergens Within an Ingredient Statement Should be Permitted 
C. Allergen Statements Should Not Be Required to Be Combined with Other Disclosures 
D. Flexibility in Statement Placement Would Be Preferred  
E. Processing and Fining Agent Disclosure Should Depend on Presence in the Final Product 
 Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025

F. Labeling of Fish Species Should be Optional 
G. Allergen Advisory Labeling Should Not Be Included in This Proposal 
 
Additionally, we provide comments related to: Exceptions from Allergen Labeling 
Requirements;  Eﬀective Date and Compliance with the Proposed Regulations; and Other 
Questions. 
 
Points of Consideration  
 
As recognized by TTB in this NPRM, distilled spirits products are not like other foods for 
purposes of allergen labeling, as the distillation process can completely transform the 
components used to create a distilled spirits product. As stated in TTB Ruling 2020-2 and based 
on prior FDA determinations, distillation “removes protein if good manufacturing practices are 
followed, and because it is possible to verify the absence of protein or protein fragments (and 
thus gluten) in these products using scientiﬁcally valid analytical methods.”1   
 
Given this reality, the vast majority of distilled spirits products do not contain any allergenic 
material. We applaud TTB for focusing the distilled spirits regulations in this proposal around 
ingredients present in or added to ﬁnished product, not the constituents that went through or 
were used as processing aids in the distillation process, as long as the major food allergen used 
in the process “have been completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the 
ﬁnal product.”  
 
Labeling initiatives, like allergen labeling statements, should be clear, concise, and 
understandable for the end consumer, as well as structured in a way that is actionable for 
producers to implement. Any element that could be misleading or confusing will only serve to 
unnecessarily limit consumer choice and detract from the eﬃcacy of the labeling statement.  
 
It is from our shared objective that we respectfully submit our views regarding the instant 
notice and oﬀer measured feedback for the Bureau’s consideration to make this proposal as 
eﬀective and workable for industry and consumers as possible. Below we outline our feedback 
and provide additional context that we hope the Bureau will consider as it progresses with this 
rulemaking.  
 
1. Labeling of Major Food Allergens and other Mandatory Disclosures  
 
A. The Major Food Allergen Statement Should Maintain the Current Phrasing and Structure 
 
In this NPRM, TTB proposes to alter the existing major food allergen statement language to 
require producers to include the phrase “Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon 
 
1 TTB Ruling 2020-2 - Gluten Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, 
October 13, 2020, https://www.ttb.gov/rulings/r2020-2.  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025

and the name of the food source for which each major food allergen is derived. While we agree 
with the adoption of an on-pack allergen statement for major food allergens, DISCUS urges the 
Bureau to maintain the existing declaration language (""Contains: [____]"") outlined in the 
voluntary regulations. We see no reason to revise the allergen labeling statement language after 
almost 20 years of industry implementation of the voluntary framework, especially when this 
language is universally recognized by consumers and consistent with the allergen disclosures 
required by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).  
 
Consumers will most beneﬁt from an approach that is consistent with the deﬁnition and 
disclosure of ""major food allergen"" that already exists under FALCPA, the Food Allergy Safety, 
Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
TTB’s proposed phrasing does not align with the FDA's allergen labeling requirements and may 
cause consumer confusion on how to read this statement in conjunction with a separate 
""contains"" statement for ingredients, such as sulﬁtes and colors, that is present on some 
distilled spirits labels. 
 
Disclosures should communicate necessary information to consumers in the least disruptive 
manner possible. The use of ""Contains:"" followed by the required ingredients and allergens in a 
singular statement clearly communicates the information without encroachment on limited 
label space with unnecessary words. The real estate on distilled spirits labels is extremely 
limited, given the other mandatory information and that some containers are as small as 50 ml. 
In particular for small bottles, adding ""Contains major food allergen(s):"" may be diﬃcult to 
accommodate in the appropriate legibility and type size, and those superﬂuous words will most 
certainly detract from the core information – the actual allergens. 
 
As stated above, most distilled spirits brand owners of products containing a major allergen are 
already labeling these allergens under TTB’s voluntary disclosure regulations. Altering the 
phrasing of the allergen declaration statement would negatively impact those suppliers 
currently labeling these allergens on their products, as the adoption of this proposal as drafted 
would require these suppliers to undergo costly relabeling revisions to bring their labels into 
compliance. If TTB maintains the current language, no label changes would be needed for those 
products, which would save suppliers thousands of dollars per brand and free up logistics and 
supply chain focus for other products.  
 
For these reasons, TTB should retain the current statement language outlined in the voluntary 
allergen labeling regulations.  
 
B. Inclusion of Major Food Allergens Within an Ingredient Statement Should be Permitted 
 
In its NPRM, TTB asks whether the inclusion of major food allergens within an ingredient 
statement (either voluntary or in a future mandatory declaration) on labels as an alternative to 
a separate major food allergen statement should be allowed. For those suppliers who choose to 
include voluntary ingredient statements on their labels, we would support the option to list Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 4 
 
   
 
major food allergens within the ingredient statement. Due to limited label space, including a 
major food allergen within a voluntary ingredient statement would be easier to implement than 
trying to create enough space to meet another set of legibility and type size requirements. It 
would also beneﬁt consumers by placing all ingredient information in one accessible location.  
 
While DISCUS does not support a mandatory ingredient labeling statement on distilled spirits 
products for a host of reasons outlined in our comment in the ANPRM last year, if such a 
statement was mandated in the future, we would support inclusion of major food allergen 
information in the ingredient statement. A company should have the ﬂexibility to decide on a 
case-by-case basis if the allergen statement would appear within the list of ingredients or as 
part of a ""Contains"" statement. This would also align with FDA requirements.  
 
C. Allergen Statements Should Not Be Required to Be Combined with Other Disclosures 
 
TTB also queried whether they should limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens, as opposed to its current allowance to also identify the presence of ingredients 
such as caramel color, cochineal extract, or sulﬁtes, for example, and whether all mandatory 
disclosures should be included together.  
 
DISCUS would not oppose limiting the term ""Contains"" to solely food allergens when both 
allergens and other mandatory information are listed on the same label to assist in clarifying 
that the ""Contains"" moniker pertains strictly to food allergen listing. The labeling of spirits 
products, both in the U.S. and around the world, is becoming increasingly complicated and 
consumers could be confused as to what the contents of a label are actually communicating (i.e. 
food allergens, mandatory disclosure of ingredients, optional disclaimers, etc.). We would prefer 
to keep these other ingredient disclosures separate from allergen disclosures to avoid consumer 
confusion, as most producers currently do when designing their labels. In lieu of using 
“Contains” for the other TTB-mandated disclosures when sharing a label with allergen 
declarations, the Bureau could consider permitting similar terms such as “Includes.” 
 
If TTB did permit combining the major food allergens and other required ingredient listings into 
one ""Contains"" statement, we would request further clariﬁcation regarding how the list of 
components within the statement would be determined. Would the list of callouts be organized 
by weight, by order of addition, etc.? We would recommend that any major allergens be listed 
ﬁrst and then have the ﬂexibility to list the other ingredients as desired subsequently (e.g.,  
""Contains: Fish, Sesame, FD&C Yellow #5, and Caramel Color.”) This would highlight the most 
critical ingredients ﬁrst and reduce the risk of consumer confusion or inability to locate this 
important information.  
 
D. Flexibility in Statement Placement Would Be Preferred  
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks whether all mandatory disclosures, including allergen statements, should 
be located in one place on the label and whether the statement should be set apart by a box Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 5 
 
   
 
outlining the information. DISCUS does not support mandating a speciﬁc location for either all 
required TTB mandatory disclosures or the allergen statement itself. These requirements would 
take up additional space that may already be limited on labels and require the redesign of 
allergen labeling statements already in the marketplace.  
 
Consumers do not currently have any expectations on where to ﬁnd allergen information on 
alcohol beverage labels, as producers can either place these statements on the front or back 
label, and existing TTB requirements ensure these statements are conspicuous and accessible. 
Any requirements for a speciﬁc allergen statement location will be burdensome to industry 
members to eﬀectuate. Given the diﬀerences in label die-line size, SKU volumes, and the 
number of brands within an industry member's portfolio, individual company’s should be 
permitted ﬂexibility to determine where best to include the allergen statement on their labels. 
To do otherwise would upset longstanding precedent and require costly label redesign and 
printing operations across the industry.  
 
Additionally, DISCUS would not support mandating that the allergen statement be enclosed 
within a box on the label. Placing a box around the allergen statement would not conform with 
FDA's current policy and, if TTB is trying to harmonize with FDA's allergen statement 
requirements to the extent possible, then no box should be required. Regarding prescribed type 
size, under the FDA framework, the word 'Contains' (without a colon) is printed with a type size 
no smaller than the type size used in a list of ingredients. We would suggest that the TTB 
allergen statement should align with the current regulatory type size requirements for TTB’s 
mandatory information, which is 1 millimeter for containers 200 ml or less and 2 millimeters for 
containers larger than 200 ml. This would ensure consistency with the rest of the required 
information on a beverage alcohol label.   
 
E. Processing and Fining Agent Disclosure Should Depend on Presence in the Final Product 
 
In the NPRM, TTB proposes to require the disclosure of ﬁning or processing agents that are or 
contain major food allergens, with the option of including the added parenthetical “(processing 
aid)” to denote that the allergen originates from a processing aid, rather than a central 
ingredient in the product.  
 
Most processing aids used in the production of distilled spirits products are added during the 
fermentation process and subsequently distilled out of the product, ensuring that no trace of 
that processing aid, or potential allergen, remains in the ﬁnal product. Under TTB’s proposal, 
this would mean that these processing aids would not need to be disclosed as part of an 
allergen statement on a distilled spirits product.  
 
Requiring disclosure of allergens that are actually present in the ﬁnal product versus those that 
are merely used as a processing aid (consistent with FALCPA) provides consumers with needed 
transparency that will assist them in making appropriate purchasing decisions. TTB should focus 
their regulatory eﬀorts on allergen presence in the ﬁnal product rather than use in the Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 6 
 
   
 
production process to permit for consistency in approach and the greatest protection for 
consumers. Companies should have the ﬂexibility to determine if they would like to disclose or 
refrain from listing processing aids as an allergen depending upon the de minimis amount used 
in production of a product. It would be counterproductive to have an allergen labeling initiative 
that over warns when allergens may not be present in the ﬁnal product, as these declarations 
could become meaningless to individuals with food allergies and impact their potential 
beverage choices as a result. 
 
While DISCUS supports the inclusion of processing and ﬁning agents that are or contain major 
food allergens as part of the major food allergen disclosure if present in the ﬁnal product, we 
agree that the parenthetical identiﬁer should be an optional disclosure and not required. 
Consumers will likely not understand what processing aids are and this parenthetical could 
cause confusion around the product and its constituents. Further education would be required 
by the beverage alcohol industry for the consumer to understand why this is being disclosed on 
a label.  
 
In the interest of providing accurate product information, another option could be the use of a 
""Processed with"" statement instead of ""Contains,"" which would allow for a more accurate 
description of a product treated with ﬁning agents or processing aids during production. 
""Processed with"" acknowledges that the ﬁning agent or processing aid has been used during the 
production process, but does not necessarily imply that there are quantiﬁable residues in the 
ﬁnal product.  
 
F. Labeling of Fish Species Should be Optional 
 
While pertaining to wine and beer products, TTB is not proposing to require the listing of the 
speciﬁc ﬁsh species when including ﬁsh in an allergen statement. Many DISCUS members have 
wine and beer products in their portfolios, so we would like to provide a few brief comments on 
this issue. DISCUS appreciates the Bureau’s stance to not require the listing of the speciﬁc 
species of ﬁsh given the unique nature of beverage alcohol products, despite FALCPA 
amendments requiring the labeling of the species of ﬁsh used as an ingredient in a food 
product.  
 
We believe mandating the species of ﬁsh to be listed would place an unnecessary burden on 
alcohol producers to obtain additional paperwork from the isinglass or ﬁsh gelatin supplier on 
the ﬁsh species, which may or may not be available. The ﬁsh species is also irrelevant for 
purposes of an allergen statement for the use of these processing aids. We, however, support 
the option to include the ﬁsh species if a company determines they would like to further state 
the species of ﬁsh in parenthesis after the ﬁsh allergen statement.  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg

G. Allergen Advisory Labeling Should Not Be Included in This Proposal 
 
DISCUS does not recommend the Bureau build an allergen advisory labeling component (""may 
contain"" statements) into the proposal at this time. In our opinion, the beverage alcohol 
industry is not familiarized enough with these sorts of disclosures and likely does not have the 
proper knowledge to accurately disclose allergies in this way on an industry-wide scale. It would 
be diﬃcult to determine the allergens to list due to the operational inconsistencies on the part 
of manufacturers and distilled spirits operations generally do not have many of the same 
allergenic risks as other food manufacturing facilities.  
 
Further, allergen advisory labeling has the potential to create more confusion for consumers, as 
“may contain"" statements do not provide clear and actionable messages for consumers 
regarding the presence of a major food allergen.   
 
Nothing prevents suppliers from adding “may contain” statements on their beverage alcohol 
products currently, and it appears some suppliers are choosing to utilize them for certain 
products. For consumer safety and clarity, we are not opposed to their optional inclusion on 
certain products to ensure any potential exposure is noted. The inclusion of this statement 
should be at the discretion of companies as an optional statement and not a mandatory feature 
of a broader allergen labeling scheme.  
 
2. Exceptions from Allergen Labeling Requirements  
 
DISCUS applauds the Bureau for once again recognizing that distillation fundamentally alters 
and transforms ingredients, stripping away any allergenic material, and including language in 
proposed § 5.75(b)(2) that enshrines this principle into the regulatory structure. TTB, in this 
section, places appropriate focus on ingredients added to the distilled spirits product after 
distillation and evaluating label claims (or the absence thereof) related to the presence of these 
ingredients in the ﬁnal product.    
 
This regulation will go a long way to reduce consumer confusion around distilled spirits allergen 
labeling statements. Without the recognition of the transformation caused by the distillation 
process, including “wheat” on a spirits label as an ingredient, for example, could suggest that a 
whiskey distilled from wheat contains wheat in the ﬁnal product, when this is not the case as 
the wheat proteins are stripped from the product through the distillation process and all that 
remains is alcohol. This wheat declaration could unnecessarily alarm those with wheat allergies 
and inadvertently suggest that it had the nutritional value of wheat. Wheat whiskey is not the 
same as a slice of whole wheat bread, and it would not be appropriate to confuse consumers 
with any suggestion to the contrary.  
 
While we support the Bureau’s proposed exception language, further clariﬁcation would be 
appreciated around the veriﬁcation process. How is the Bureau planning to verify the presence 
or absence of allergens? Will allergens need to be listed as part of the formula submission? How Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 8 
 
   
 
will TTB be reviewing allergens during the COLA process? Will TTB mandate ﬂavor houses to 
provide an additional section on the ﬂavor ingredient data (FID) sheet to determine if allergens 
are present in a ﬂavor, or would additional documentation be required at the time of a formula 
submission? Will TTB accept allergen self-certiﬁcation? Who will assume the liability if an 
allergen is missed since TTB would be verifying the statement? 
 
These questions, among others, will need to be thoughtfully considered as TTB seeks to ﬁnalize 
this proposal.  
 
3. Eﬀective Date and Compliance with the Proposed Regulations  
 
A multitude of brands and labels will be aﬀected by this initiative, both domestically and 
internationally. Given the global commerce in beverage alcohol products and the multitude of 
products that are imported into the United States, DISCUS appreciates the ﬁve-year phase-in 
period included in the proposal and believes that this implementation timeframe should be 
suﬃcient to eﬀectuate the necessary labeling changes. Compliance would be possible even 
sooner, of course, if the Bureau decides to maintain the existing allergen statement language. 
This revision would bring most allergen-containing products in the marketplace into almost 
immediate compliance, as most products containing allergens include the voluntary label 
statement.  
 
DISCUS appreciates the Bureau not requiring resubmission of COLAs to include allergen 
statements if not already present, as this would’ve greatly increased burdens throughout the 
industry and for the Bureau’s ALFD staﬀ.  
 
Further clariﬁcation is needed, however, regarding the exact mechanics of the ultimate 
compliance date and which products it could impact that are already in the marketplace. Would 
it only be applicable to new product produced after the ﬁnal rule goes into eﬀect? What about 
inventory sitting either in a warehouse or on a store shelf? Should industry members expect to 
receive a blanket ""use up"" for all pre-compliance date bottles? Would existing inventory need to 
be reworked to comply with the ﬁnal rule? What if there is overlap of old and new allergen 
labeling bottles and what liability/exposure would industry members face? These important 
questions demonstrate the realities suppliers will need to contend with if this proposal is 
ﬁnalized, as well as the type of questions the Bureau should be prepared to respond to either in 
the rule language itself or an accompanying FAQ guidance document.  
 
We also urge the Bureau to synchronize the implementation of any mandatory labeling changes 
so that industry members are able to comply with these new requirements in the most eﬃcient 
manner. This would include not only the proposed alcohol facts labeling requirements, but also 
any ingredient labeling proposal the Bureau might be considering. While we understand that 
the advance notice of proposed rulemaking related to ingredient labeling was withdrawn earlier  
  Ms. Amy Greenberg 
August 15, 2025 
Page 9 
 
   
 
this year prior to its release, if the Bureau was intending to revive it in another form, it’s critical 
to note that any eventual ingredient labeling requirements being on a diﬀerent implementation 
track would be ﬁnancially and logistically devasting for industry members large and small.  
 
It would be unreasonable to ask industry members to undergo costly label redesign to include 
allergen and nutrient content information and begin production on those new labels across all 
their product lines, only to be notiﬁed they will need to restart label redesign to incorporate 
ingredient information in a couple years. We respectfully request that TTB consider this 
important point as they seek to ﬁnalize these pending rulemakings and prepare their future 
regulatory agenda. 
 
4. Other Questions 
 
In the NPRM, TTB asks whether a QR code could alternatively be used to provide major food 
allergen disclosures. While we support including major food allergen disclosures physically on 
labels, we recognize that QR codes would be an adequate alternative to achieve compliance 
under the proposed rulemaking, particularly if the Bureau is concerned about potential costs for 
industry members or suppliers want to add this information to a QR code while they plan 
labeling changes.  
 
The ability to use QR code to provide allergen and alcohol facts statements would allow a 
company to better manage label ordering, label inventory and write oﬀ costs, as changes can 
quickly be made to a website if there is a change to batching that may or may not aﬀect allergen 
and/or alcohol facts statements.  QR codes could also be a helpful way to alleviate the already 
cluttered mandatory information required on label (i.e. TTB mandatory information, CSR 
statements, state mandated recycling information, etc.), as they are a consumer-friendly way to 
access important information without taking up additional space on labels and placing potential 
ﬁnancial burdens on suppliers.  
 
TTB also queried about compliance costs associated with the proposal and noted that additional 
analytical testing was not required. Some industry members will still seek to utilize outside 
laboratories, however, to test for the presence or absence of a major food allergen, so potential 
operating costs for swab kits and lab analysis should be considered.  
 
Conclusion 
 
America’s distillers and marketers of spirits want to ensure that consumers have access to the 
major food allergen information they need. We appreciate the opportunity to comment upon 
the Bureau's allergen labeling initiative and stand ready to work with TTB to support a allergen 
labeling scheme that is scientiﬁcally-based and properly recognizes the transformative nature of 
distillation on ingredients used in the production process.

Re: TTB Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg, 
 
I write on behalf of the Brewers Association (BA) to provide written input on TTB 
Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages.1  We appreciate the extension of the comment period for this notice and 
respectfully submit these written comments on behalf of America’s small and 
independent brewers.  We thank you in advance for your time and attention to these 
comments. 
 
As you know, the Brewers Association is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association 
of brewers, for brewers and by brewers.  We have approximately 5,000 U.S. 
professional brewery members and over 1,200 supplier members from throughout 
the beer supply chain.  Our mission is to promote and protect American 
craft brewers and their beers. 
 
The Brewers Association has long supported the concept of mandatory allergen 
labeling for malt beverages, along with other alcohol beverages.  A consumer’s 
ignorance about the presence of an allergen in a beverage can have serious, even 
life-threatening, health consequences.  This distinguishes, in a fundamental way, 
allergen labeling from disclosures related to, for example, calories, carbohydrates, 
fat, or protein. 
 
We now turn to our specific comments on Notice 238’s proposed regulations. 
 
 
 
 
1 90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (Jan. 17, 2025). 2 
 
1. Materials Not Present in the Finished Product Should Not Require Label 
Disclosure 
 
While the mandatory allergen labeling rules proposed by Notice 238 contemplate 
an exemption process, the Brewers Association believes that a rational rule must 
start with the premise that disclosures are required only if the finished product – the 
product reaching consumers – contains the allergen in question.  After all, a malt 
beverage or other food that does not contain an allergen will not cause an allergic 
reaction among sensitive individuals. 
 
In this regard, we wish to remind TTB that over-disclosure has costs for consumers.  
Individuals with allergies should have access to as wide a variety of food, including 
malt beverages, as safety permits.  This consideration may explain the Food & Drug 
Administration’s (FDA’s) failure to mandate “may contains” allergen warnings (they 
are voluntary), as a mandate might encourage risk-averse food manufacturers to 
overuse such labeling as a simple way to avoid liability and careful testing.  Warning 
a consumer away from foods that they can consume without an adverse health 
reaction deprives that consumer of choice and variety without a corresponding 
health benefit. 
 
Notice 238 proposes including processing aids and other incidental additives in an 
allergen labeling rule, citing the approach of The Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA).2  As TTB recognizes, however, while 
harmonizing with FDA standards under FALCPA is often beneficial, Congress clearly 
contemplated that TTB would depart from those standards where appropriate.3   
 
TTB already has recognized that alcohol beverages will, at times, require a different 
approach.  Most notably, Notice 238 proposes to codify existing TTB policy treating 
distilled spirits as not containing an allergen if the product has been subject to 
complete distillation that removes allergenic proteins.4 
 
We urge TTB to take a similar approach in other instances when sound scientific 
evidence indicates the lack of allergenic proteins in a finished product.  To take one 
example, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have ruled that the fining 
agent isinglass can safely be used as a processing aid in beer and wine.5  While TTB, 
with FDA assistance, should undertake a review of the evidence and not rely blindly 
on other nations’ conclusions, we commend to TTB the more flexible approach that 
does not result in over-warning sensitive individuals to allergens that are not, in 
fact, found in a finished product.

Notice 238 proposes to exempt the need to identify a particular fish species where a 
Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act)-regulated product may contain fish.6  
As already noted, we question whether the most likely reason for such a disclosure 
– use of the fining agent isinglass – should trigger an allergen disclosure.  In any 
case, if a disclosure of fish is required, the Brewers Association agrees that the 
identification of fish species should not be required in the case of fish-derived 
processing aids. 
 
Notice 238 proposes to permit the label of a food made with a processing aid 
derived from one of the major allergens to optionally identify a material as a 
“processing aid” on the label.7  As already noted, the Brewers Association does not 
agree that a processing aid whose material does not remain in a finished food 
should require disclosure.  But if TTB mandates such disclosure, we would support 
providing the option of identifying the allergen as a “processing aid.” 
 
2. For an Exemption System to Work, TTB Must Establish Sensible 
Thresholds 
 
The Brewers Association supports the development of tolerance thresholds, as any 
exemption system becomes otherwise unstable and untenable as detection 
technology improves. 
 
Notice 238 indicates that TTB, deferring to FDA, will not adopt any tolerances for 
allergens in FAA Act-regulated products.8  But without a threshold on what trace 
amounts of a material are permitted, advances in detection technology will require 
constant updates to recognized exemptions.  Of course, such thresholds should be 
based on sound science.  But as detection technology improves, even trace 
amounts of a material, perhaps naturally occurring and from multiple sources, 
might become detectable. 
 
TTB regulations should create certainty, not require the industry to “chase 
technology.”  In the case of the exemption process contemplated by TTB, better 
detection technology would require it to amend the regulations as soon as 
advancing detection technology can identify minute levels of an exempted material 
in a finished product.  This burden of technology “moving the goalposts” would put 
a strain on both government and industry resources.

3. “Contains” Should be SuƯicient (instead of “Contains Major Food 
Allergens”) 
 
The Brewers Association believes that the statement preceding a mandatory 
allergen disclosure should simply say “contains,” and not the wordy and 
unnecessary “contains major food allergens” as proposed in Notice 238.9 
 
To any reasonable consumer with a known allergen sensitivity, the word “contains” 
plus an identification of the allergen(s) present will give that individual the 
information they need.  A person sensitive to gluten, for example, would instantly 
recognize that a product labeled “Contains: Wheat” could trigger an allergic 
reaction.  Adding “major food allergens” does not add any useful information.  If the 
individual does not yet know they suffer from an allergic reaction to a particular 
material, then identifying that material as a “major food allergen” does nothing to 
alert that individual to a possible health reaction. 
 
Given that TTB proposes to defer to FDA on quite a few policy matters tackled by 
Notice 238, the Brewers Association does not understand why it ignores FDA when 
it comes to the wording of the proposed mandatory allergen statement.  Under the 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) administered by FDA, the word 
“contains” is sufficient for the labels of foods falling under FDA’s primary labeling 
jurisdiction.10  The Brewers Association does not perceive any need for a different 
approach with respect to FAA Act-regulated products. 
 
The Brewers Association also urges TTB to consider regulatory burden when 
choosing the wording of its disclosure.  “Contains major food allergens” is 
unnecessarily wordy, taking valuable labeling space – a scarce resource on a 
typical malt beverage label.11  Keeping mandatory wording short where, as here, the 
benefit to the consumer of added words is unclear strikes a better balance between 
consumer protection and avoiding unnecessary burdens on the industry. 
 
Finally, using the term “major allergens” erroneously assumes that the typical 
consumer understands what this means.  It strains credulity to believe that 
consumers know the legal distinction between “major” allergens (those in FALCP 
and the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research [FASTER] Act) and 
other allergens.  Once again, the only conclusion is that the added information 
would do little to assist consumers make smart choices.

10 See 21 U.S.C. § 343(w).  
11 A standard twelve-ounce beer can with a full-wrap label has just 3.625” times 8” of total labeling 
space available. 5 
 
4. A New Major Allergen Disclosure Should Incorporate Existing Disclosures 
for FD&C Yellow No. 5, Cochineal Extract or Carmine, Sulﬁtes, and 
Aspartame 
 
The Brewers Association encourages TTB to adopt a final rule that groups all 
allergen information in a single place.  Existing TTB regulations require the label 
disclosure of FD&C Yellow No. 5, Cochineal Extract or Carmine, Sulfites, and 
Aspartame,12 all due to the possibility of allergic reactions to these materials.  
Folding the disclosure of such material into the disclosure of major food allergens 
makes eminent sense. 
 
An effective allergen labeling rule will enable consumers to find all mandatory 
allergen information in one place.  Placing such disclosures in two places – one for 
“major” allergens and a different place for other allergens – would risk a consumer 
seeing one statement and assuming that it conveys all mandatory allergen 
information.  A single grouping after the word “contains” would best ensure that 
consumers find all the allergen information they need. 
 
Moreover, dividing allergen disclosures into multiple separate statements based on 
the legal basis for the disclosure would elevate legal form over real-world 
substance.  As already explained in Section 3, above, we do not believe consumers 
would recognize nor understand the distinction between FALCP-mandated allergen 
disclosures and those (such as sulfites) arising from prior TTB rulemaking action.  
Basing a consumer-protection rule on legal distinctions few consumers understand 
would not advance the informative purpose of allergen labeling. 
 
5. A Linear Display on the Label is SuƯicient and Gives Producers Flexibility  
 
The Brewers Association agrees with Notice 238’s proposed approach of permitting 
an allergen disclosure via linear display.  We see no reason to highlight allergens in 
a text box.13 
 
Individuals with allergies already are familiar with FDA’s allergen disclosures, which 
do not require a specific text box or other highlighting of allergen information.  
Instead, FDA’s major allergen rule allows the “contains” statement as text within 
the Principal Display Panel.14  We are not aware of any problem with consumers 
finding the allergen information on FD&C Act-regulated products. 
 
TTB must also recognize that the amount of space on a beer label is quite limited.  
For industry, this means that any loss of space to a text box deprives them of 
valuable branding room.  More importantly, consumers interested in allergen 
information do not have a large area to scan in order to find an allergen statement.  
 
12 See 27 C.F .R. § 7.63(b). 
13 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 5769. 
14 See FDA Guidance Document, Guidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding Food 
Allergen Labeling (Edition 5), FDA-2022-D-0099 (Jan. 2025). 6 
 
Thus, we perceive little danger that a linear display without a text box or other 
highlighting will result in consumers not finding the allergen information they need. 
 
Finally, permitting allergen information by linear display is consistent with TTB’s 
position in Notice 237, proposing certain nutritional declarations on the labels of 
FAA Act-regulated products.  We see no reason to treat allergen information 
differently. 
 
6. The Compliance Date Should be the Same as Any Compliance Date for 
the Nutritional Labeling Rules in Notice 237 and any Compliance Date for 
FDA’s Front-of-Package Labeling Rule 
 
Small and independent brewers, along with most of the alcohol beverage industry, 
currently face the prospect of three new federal labeling mandates: 
 
 The mandatory allergen disclosures contemplated by Notice 238; 
 
 The nutritional, alcohol content, and possibly other disclosures 
contemplated by TTB Notice 237;15 and 
 
 For alcohol beverages falling under FDA’s primary labeling jurisdiction, a 
front-of-label packaging mandate contemplated by FDA Docket No. FDA–
2024–N–2910.16 
 
The prospect of implementing different labeling changes at different times is 
daunting to any industry member, but particularly to small producers.  The Brewers 
Association accordingly supports Notice 238’s suggestion17 that any 
implementation date be coordinated with the mandatory effective date of any final 
regulations flowing from TTB Notice 237. 
 
The Brewers Association also supports Notice 238’s suggestion18 that a final rule 
allow industry members to add a mandatory allergen labeling statement to labels 
without the need to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) from 
TTB.  This sensible approach will save considerable government and industry 
resources.  Absent this accommodation, TTB would find itself inundated with 
hundreds of thousands of COLA applications as the compliance date for new 
regulations approaches. 
 
Finally, we support a five-year compliance date as the default phase-in period for 
any new allergen labeling mandate.  As explained in more detail in the Brewers 
Association’s comments in connection with Notice 237, however, we do not believe 
the five-year period will spare all or perhaps even most small brewers from the need 
for a regulatory-mandated label change.

Required food allergen labeling would increase transparency in consumable products, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the safety of a product for their health and safety.   Labeling for allergens on packaging at the point of sale allows the broadest spectrum of consumers the ability to assess the safety of a product for purchase. This placement is important as it coincides with packaged food labeling and is where consumers are accustomed to looking for allergen and nutritional information. However, in the absence of any labeling and if absolutely necessary, AllergyStrong also supports the use of QR codes which will also serve an important role in conveying important allergen and other safety and nutritional information to help protect allergic consumers.  AllergyStrong would like to see a shorter implementation time of three to four years. The gap in allergen labeling on alcoholic beverage is long overdue and badly needed to prevent the complications of alcohol vis-à-vis accidental allergen consumption.    Background on food allergies: o 33 million Americans live with food allergies – that is more than 1 in 10 adults. o You can be allergic to nearly any food – but 9 are responsible for 90% of reactions.   o Reactions are unpredictable and range from mild to fatal – each person’s food allergy can become life-threatening even if their last multiple reactions to the same food have been manageable.  AllergyStrong strongly encourages TTB to finalize the Major Food Allergen Labeling rule for many reasons:  1. Given the prevalence of food allergy, this is an issue of consumer safety.  2. The majority of people are not aware alcohol falls outside the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) – mistakenly believing that any consumable product is accurately labeled for allergens.  3. This misconception about current allergen labeling requirements on alcohol includes both individuals with food allergies as well as bartenders, waitstaff, and event personnel who may be operating on incomplete/incorrect information.  4. Currently consumers cannot access allergy information at the point of sale to assess a product’s safety – thus limiting what they can purchase or consume.  5. On-product labeling (the gold standard) or QR codes (if necessary) would be helpful to both sellers/consumers. Clear consistent labeling and a campaign to ensure customers know where to look for this information is most critical.    6. We strongly recommend labeling for the Top 9 allergens consistent with FALCPA and encourage voluntary disclosure of corn which is also prevalent (and even more common in Black and non-white Hispanic communities1) and incredibly difficult to manage for those who are allergic.  7. Currently consumers typically purchase alcohol outside of customer service hours, making it difficult to obtain allergen information if manufacturers are willing to disclose. Easy-to-access information will solve for this issue and may alleviate some burden from customer service representatives regarding allergen questions. o Information displayed via QR code/website should be displayed in multiple languages. For those with English as a second language, interacting with customer service is a difficult barrier to obtaining clear health information.  8. Alcohol is a cofactor that can complicate reactions by reducing the amount of allergen it takes to trigger a reaction2. Because of this, people with food allergies limit themselves to only a few trusted brands or stay away from any alcohol consumption entirely due to allergen concerns. Labeling for allergens would most likely expand their options, providing them the information needed to expand purchase/consumption options.  9. Alcohol is being used more and more in food products (such as barbeque sauces, stews, and reduction sauces), making it difficult to obtain clear allergen information on these food products.  10. Because a variety of major allergens are not widely used in alcohol products, labeling for the Top 9 allergens would allow producers to sell to new market.  11.  Wine and alcohol are labeled for allergens in Canada (where manufacturers must declare allergens and gluten in ingredient list or “may contains” statement) as well as in the EU.  Changing the allergen labeling for alcohol requirements would bring the United States in line with other Western nations.   Labeling for food allergens makes sense. Transparency and easily accessible allergen info is of great interest to allergic consumers. Once consumer safety is ensured, AllergyStrong believes we can expect an expanded consumer market for manufacturers, restaurants, bars, and other establishments where alcohol is sold.   Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.  Sincerely,  Erin Malawer Executive Director, AllergyStrong Allergystrong.org

Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003) 
 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) respectfully submits the following 
comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rule on major 
food allergens for the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. CSPI is a non-profit 
consumer education and advocacy organization that has worked since 1971 to improve the 
public’s health through better nutrition and safer food. CSPI publishes Nutrition Action and is 
supported by the subscribers to Nutrition Action, individual donors, and foundation grants. CSPI 
is an independent organization that does not accept any corporate donations. 
 
CSPI commends TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and 
protect consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the top nine major food allergens 
that does not exempt processing aids. We would support a variety of wording options for 
phrasing the disclosure (e.g. “Contains...”), provided that TTB adopts a specific required 
phrasing to ensure uniformity. Most importantly, we urge TTB to finalize the proposed rule as 
expeditiously as possible; U.S. residents have already waited more than long enough for this 
information. 
 
However, the final rule should be strengthened by: 
• Specifying where the allergen disclosure should appear. 
• Outlining specific formatting requirements. 
• Requiring species-specific disclosure for the labeling of finfish.  
• Adjusting the proposed 5-year compliance period to a 3.5-year compliance period, 
striking a better balance between giving consumers access to the information they need 
and want while still minimizing cost to industry.  
• Explicitly requiring the allergen disclosure to appear on-package and never solely via 
electronic means (e.g., via QR code), as this would place a barrier between consumers 
and this vital information. 
 2 
 
1) Background 
 
When Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 
2004, the associated House report documented the expectation that TTB would “determine how, 
as appropriate, to apply allergen labeling of beverage alcohol products and the labeling 
requirements for those products.”
1 It has been over 20 years since that bill was passed, but TTB 
has never issued final regulations applying allergen labeling requirements to alcohol.  
CSPI has a long history of advocating for transparency to protect consumers with food allergies, 
including ingredient and major food allergen labeling. In 2003, CSPI, the National Consumers 
League (NCL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and 66 other health and consumer 
organizations filed a citizen petition calling on TTB to require a standardized label including 
ingredients on all beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with an emphasis on the importance of listing 
common allergens.2 In 2005, TTB requested public comments on alcohol labeling,3 and in 2006, 
TTB issued a proposed rule for mandatory allergen labeling,4 but this rule was never finalized. 
Instead, an interim rule from 2006 allows voluntary allergen labeling.5 In October 2022, CSPI, 
NCL, and CFA filed a lawsuit demanding a long-overdue response to our 19-year-old citizen 
petition.6 In November 2022, in a letter responding to our lawsuit, TTB stated that it would 
engage in new rulemakings on nutrient and alcohol content labeling, ingredient labeling, and 
major food allergen labeling.7 
 
The present proposed rulemaking was issued in January 2025 and would require all TTB-
regulated alcoholic beverages to label the top nine food allergens using the statement “Contains 
Major Food Allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source(s) from which the 
food allergen(s) present is/are derived (i.e., milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, 
soybeans, and sesame). Unlike FDA regulations, the species of finfish is not required for fish 
ingredients. The proposed rule also applies to fining or processing agents, which are additives 
used in the production of alcohol. The rule allows for some exemptions, including for ingredients 
that are incorporated prior to the distillation process, in a manner such that no allergenic protein 
exists in the final product. The rule does not include any type size, formatting, or presentation 
requirements for the disclosure. 
 
2) Public Health Importance of Allergen Labeling 
 
Requiring allergen labeling on alcohol is a commonsense approach to ensuring consumers with 
food allergies have all the information they need to make informed purchases and stay safe when 
drinking alcohol. We commend TTB for proposing a strong mandatory allergen disclosure rule 
that does not exempt processing agents. 
 
Roughly 11% of U.S. adults have food allergies.
8 To help consumers with food allergies avoid 
allergic reactions, FDA-regulated food and beverages are required to clearly disclose the nine 3 
 
most common food allergens using their common name either in the text of the ingredient list (in 
parentheses if not already listed by the common name) or after using a “contains” statement.9 
Currently, TTB-regulated products are not required to disclose these allergens. Insufficient 
allergen and ingredient labeling puts millions of Americans with food allergies at risk of 
reactions ranging from mild to deadly. 
 
Without proper labeling, consumers may be unaware that alcoholic beverages often contain 
major food allergens. This includes wheat in many beers, shellfish in some micheladas (Mexican 
beverages with beer, lime juice, and sometimes clam juice),
10,11 milk in liqueurs such as Baileys 
Irish Cream, and tree nuts in liqueurs such as Amaretto, Frangelico, and Nocello.12 Additionally, 
additives authorized by federal regulations for use in winemaking include ingredients derived 
from fish, milk, and eggs.13  
 
Consumers with food allergies rely heavily on labels to help them avoid allergens. A recent study 
found that 71% of those with food allergies check labels for allergens every time they purchase a 
product, highlighting the importance of on-package labeling.14 In recognition of the importance 
of ensuring consumers have access to allergen information, Australia, New Zealand,15 Canada,16 
and the EU17 already require allergen disclosure for at least some alcoholic beverages.  
 
A March 2024 poll commissioned by CSPI found that consumers do not have all the information 
they desire from alcohol labels.
18 Big Village’s CARAVAN U.S. Online Omnibus Survey was 
administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, demographically balanced to 
represent the U.S. Census on age, sex, geographical region, race, and ethnicity. Of the 1,924 
respondents, 1,509 (78%) reported consuming a drink containing alcohol in the past year. 
Respondents answered questions about their level of support and perceived importance of 
alcohol labeling. An analysis of those respondents who had at least one drink in the past year 
found that 65% support required labeling of allergens on alcohol and 79% would find allergen 
information at least somewhat helpful when making purchasing decisions about alcoholic 
beverages.  
 
In addition to major allergen labeling, full ingredients labeling is important for the many 
consumers who have non-major food allergies. Over 170 foods are known to cause allergic 
reactions.
19 To ensure the safety of consumers with all types of food allergies, separately TTB 
should also publish the pre-rule on ingredients, which was previously sent to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB)20 and call for mandatory ingredient labeling on all alcohol.  
 
Below, we provide input on the questions posed by TTB in the proposed rule, with an emphasis 
on the importance of mandatory, on-package allergen disclosure, with consistent formatting. 
 
  4 
 
3) Wording and Format 
 
As already noted, TTB proposed the language: “Contains major food allergen (s):____” and 
seeks comment on the content and placement of the disclosure. So long as the disclosure is 
mandatory, CSPI would support a variety of options for content and placement of the allergen 
disclosure, provided all ingredient disclosures on the label are required to be located in close 
proximity to each other. We also encourage TTB to move forward with mandatory ingredient 
labeling, on which the agency has not yet produced a proposed rule, as this will help consumers 
identify additional allergens beyond the top nine. 
 
a. Wording 
While the proposed language “Contains major food allergen (s):____” is useful, a more 
straightforward “Contains:” statement is also appropriate for major allergen disclosure. This is 
the wording consumers are likely accustomed to as this is the format often used for major 
allergen disclosure on FDA-labeled products.  
 
While TTB has not yet proposed requiring full ingredient disclosure for alcohol, certain specific 
ingredients are already required to be disclosed on-label. These include sulfites, FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, and carmine or cochineal extract.21–23 Additionally, a beer or distilled liquor that contains 
aspartame is required to disclose “PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.” 
Some of these ingredients, including FD&C Yellow No. 5 and carmine or cochineal extract, are 
also allergens. TTB has sought comment on whether such ingredients should be included with 
the allergen disclosure. 
 
If TTB adopts a simple “Contains” statement, in the absence of a mandatory ingredient list, TTB 
may consider allowing all ingredients that are allergens requiring disclosure to be combined in 
one “Contains” statement (e.g., “Contains allergen(s):______,” or simply “Contains:            ”), 
with the exception of aspartame which requires more specific wording and should remain in the 
current required format (i.e., PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE), as 
this may help to signal the presence of the ingredient to consumers with phenylketonuria for 
whom allergy is not a specific issue. 
 
b. Location 
All mandatory ingredient and allergen disclosures for alcohol should be required to appear in 
close proximity to each other, ideally directly adjacent to the proposed “Alcohol Facts” panel. A 
2021 analysis of the allergen labeling of products labeled for European Union regulation found 
that lack of a standard location for allergen information can make it harder to identify this 
information on the label.24 Including additional ingredient information (e.g., other required 
ingredient disclosures) nearby would further improve the ability of consumers to note any 5 
 
important health and safety information and prevent them from having to search through other 
material on the label. 
 
If TTB mandates ingredient labeling, TTB should also mandate that the “Contains” statement 
appear below, or immediately adjacent to the ingredients list, which ideally would be required to 
appear directly under or adjacent to the mandatory “Alcohol Facts” panel. This would align with 
how consumers are accustomed to finding this information on FDA labels, which requires 
allergen information to be either within, after, or adjacent to the ingredients list.9 If the allergen 
labeling requirement is finalized in the absence of a mandatory “Alcohol Facts,” the allergen 
information should be offset by a box to aid consumers in locating it. 
 
c. Within ingredient list allergen disclosure 
TTB is soliciting feedback on potentially allowing major allergen disclosure within a mandatory 
or voluntary ingredients list. FDA allows for disclosure of major allergens within the ingredient 
list provided the common or usual name for the allergen is used (or is present in parentheses next 
to the ingredient if the common or usual name of the allergen is not clearly in the ingredient 
name).
25  However, TTB should require that a separate “Contains” statement be present directly 
below the “Alcohol Facts” panel, regardless of whether a full ingredients list is mandatory. The 
separate statement, in either scenario, would most clearly signal to consumers when a major food 
allergen is present and avoid the risk that consumers will wrongly infer the absence of such 
allergens when such separate statements do not appear. 
 
d. Format 
Allergen information should be subject to the same general requirements that apply to all 
mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels including that the information is readily 
legible, on a contrasting background, and appear as text at least 1 millimeter in height for smaller 
containers and 2 millimeters in height for larger containers.26–28 The word “Contains” should 
appear in bold. 
 
4) Considerations for Finfish 
TTB is not proposing to require the name of the fish species when finfish is present in a product, 
instead allowing for the simple disclosure of “fish.” However, many people with a finfish allergy 
are able to consume one or more different species of finfish29 and solely labeling “fish” may lead 
consumers with specific fish allergies to unnecessarily avoid products. TTB should instead 
require that specific types of finfish be declared. This would align with FALCPA, which covers 
all FDA-regulated foods and requires that the species of fish also appear on the label.25 
 
In the proposed rule, TTB cites concerns that vintners and brewers using isinglass and fish 
gelatin as a fining agent often do not know what species of fish was used to make the product. 
While the burden of finding this out should not be on the alcohol producer, the problem could be 6 
 
solved if manufacturers of this product simply started disclosing the type of fish from which their 
products are derived. Notably, some products used for fining alcohol already have FALCPA 
compliant allergen disclosures (see Figure 1). In any event, asking vintners and brewers to 
ascertain exactly what fish is in their product does not seem like a major burden.

5) Distillation Exemption 
 
TTB is soliciting feedback on the proposal to exempt allergenic ingredients that have undergone 
distillation from allergen disclosure given that no protein remains after the distillation process. 
TTB would require producers to be prepared to substantiate the absence of major food allergens 
only if ingredients containing protein are added to the product post distillation. We agree with 
this exemption. 
 
6) Allergen Disclosures need to appear directly on-package 
 
Allergen information is critical for consumers who have food allergies and should be listed on 
the physical beverage container. TTB is seeking comments about whether there are alternatives 
to on-package allergen disclosure, such as a QR code leading to a website with the disclosure, 
that would still adequately inform consumers. CSPI does not support an option to provide 
allergen disclosures via QR code as it would create an undue burden on consumers with food 
allergies, who would need to spend excessive time scanning QR codes in-store just to figure out 
if they can or cannot consume a product. They will be more likely to simply not scan the product, 
depriving them of potentially critical information. Additionally, accessing QR codes requires a 
7 
 
smartphone, which not all consumers have, and internet access with good reception, which not 
all stores and drinking venues provide.  
 
Barriers created by QR code disclosures would disproportionately affect consumers who are 
older or have lower incomes. In 2024, 84% of adults with annual household incomes less than 
$30,000 owned smartphones compared to 96% of adults with annual household incomes over 
$100,000.30 These data show similar sized gaps in smartphone ownership by age, with 79% of 
adults aged 65 and older owning smartphones compared to 91 to 98% of adults in younger age 
groups.  
 
Those living in rural or tribal areas would also be disproportionately impacted by lack of access 
to information if provided via QR code. A recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
report,
31 which included data from 2022, shows a rural-urban gap for access to high-speed 
mobile internet (defined as 5G-NR with upload/download speeds at least 35/3 Mbps) with 64% 
access in rural areas versus 98% in urban areas. People living in tribal areas also face lower rates 
of access to reliable mobile internet (78%) compared to those living in urban areas. Even rates of 
“fixed terrestrial services” (i.e., fixed broadband services excluding fixed satellite service) 
deployments at all internet speeds differ for rural versus urban versus tribal areas, with especially 
large gaps in access to internet speeds of 100/20 Mbps (which FCC uses as a benchmark to 
assess progress towards the goal of ensuring all Americans have access to “advanced 
telecommunications capability.”)  While 98% of Americans living in urban areas have access to 
fixed terrestrial service speeds of 100/20 Mbps, only 72% of those living in rural areas and 76% 
of those living in tribal areas have access to this internet service speed. 
 
In CSPI’s March 2024 poll,
18 adults who drank alcohol at least once in the past year were asked, 
“How would you prefer to learn about the ingredients, alcohol content, allergens, calories, and 
nutritional content of an alcoholic beverage?” Respondents could select one of four response 
options: 
1. Read this information on the label of the container 
2. Scan a QR code on the label 
3. Visit a website address provided on the label 
4. I do not want to learn this information 
More than three quarters (76%) of respondents who drink said they would prefer to read 
information on the label of the container, while only 11% preferred to scan a QR code. The 
desire to see this information on-package was particularly strong among respondents living in 
suburban (79%) and rural communities (78%) compared to those living in urban communities 
(70%) and respondents over the age of 65 (83%) compared to younger respondents (71% of 
respondents ages 21-34) (Appendix A). 8 
 
Because FDA mandates that this information appear on-package for all foods, supplements, and 
drugs it regulates, consumers are used to finding it on-package and therefore might not realize 
this information is even available if it is solely provided via QR code. For example, consumers 
might be accustomed to seeing “contains milk” on FDA-regulated products and then misinterpret 
the lack of an allergen disclosure on a TTB-regulated liqueur or canned cocktail containing milk 
to mean it is safe to consume. 
Recently, the European Union updated its regulations for wine labeling to include mandatory 
ingredients, nutrition declaration, and allergen disclosure. While the new regulations allow for 
some information to be disclosed via QR code, they specify that allergen information is always 
required to also appear on-package.32 
 
7) Compliance date 
 
TTB has proposed a compliance date of 5 years. This period is excessive and would further delay 
information that is vital for those with food allergies from appearing on alcohol products. An 
adjusted period of 3.5-years would better balance providing consumers with the information they 
need while minimizing cost to industry. According to FDA, food and beverage products tend to 
be voluntarily relabeled on a 2-5 year cycle, with most products undergoing voluntary label 
changes at least every 2-3 years.
33 
 
Generally, the cost of label changes includes new labeling equipment (if needed), and any costs 
associated with label redesign, printing, and administration. While extra staff time for mandatory 
label-specific changes may add slight cost, when label changes for regulatory purposes coincide 
with changes the manufacturer would have made to their label in any case, the analysis estimates 
that there is minimal additional cost for the label design change to the manufacturer. 
 
Per the cost analysis explained in detail in the alcohol facts proposed rule (referenced in the 
allergen proposed rule),
34 TTB estimates that for brand name products, 100% of changes would 
overlap with a regularly scheduled change within 2 years. Private labels, which make up a 
smaller share of the market, would be able to coordinate 100% of their changes by the 3.5-year 
mark. Additionally, the model estimates that there are per-UPC cost reductions in extending the 
compliance period from 2 years to 3.5 years, but from 3.5 years onward the cost per UPC does 
not decrease further. Similarly, the total cost would not decrease further by extending the 
compliance period past 3.5 years. 
 
Another metric used in TTB’s analysis, the total cost using a 2% discount rate, similarly sees a 
dramatic decrease in the total cost of labeling changes when extending the deadline from 2 years 
to 3.5 years ($323.4 million at 2 years down to $259.5 million at 3 years and down to $204.3 
million at 3.5 years). However, the reduction in price is far smaller when extending from a 3.5- 
to a 5-year compliance period, which reduces the discounted total by only ~$3 million more 9 
 
(1.5%). Based on TTB’s own analysis, a 3.5-year compliance period would be more than fair and 
strike a balance between minimizing cost to industry and providing consumers access to 
important and long overdue information in a timely fashion. 
 
To further minimize costs, we recommend that TTB align the compliance dates for the two 
current proposed rules (allergens and alcohol facts). We do not recommend coordinating 
compliance with the ingredient labeling pre-rule, as this would likely take much longer than the 
other two rules to finalize and could mean significant delay of the other two rules. 
 
8) Conclusion 
 
In the two decades CSPI has been advocating for allergen disclosure on alcohol, consumers with 
allergens have been left without access to this basic information that is present on nearly all other 
foods and beverages. 
 
Finalizing this proposed rule to require on-package disclosure of the top nine major food 
allergens on alcoholic beverages would be an important and commonsense step towards ensuring 
consumers with food allergies who choose to drink can do so safely. We hope that TTB will also 
move swiftly to publish and finalize the ingredient labeling rule to protect those with allergies to 
foods other than the top nine allergens.

Re: Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages
Dear Ms. Greenberg:
Family Winemakers of California is a trade association which advocates for 
predominately small, family-owned wineries in California – most of whom produce less 
than 5,000 cases of wine/year.  Celebrating our 35th anniversary this year, our members 
continually contribute to the agricultural strength and economy of California 
communities.
We understand the importance of the role of allergens in the health and welfare of our 
consumers, and support providing accurate information to those customers. While the 
TTB regulations on fining and clarification do allow the use of some agents (albumin, 
milk, and isinglass) in the winemaking process, the “use” of these agents doesn’t 
necessarily mean that the allergen is present in the final wine. Labeling based upon 
“use” of a fining agent in the production of wine is not only inaccurate, but meaningless 
consumer information. Any residual agent in the finished wine is not only often 
undetectable, but if found, it is in a trace amount. It is also likely that the tertiary 
structure of the allergen will be sufficiently modified by the alcohol to reduce the 
likelihood of an allergic reaction. 
The use of scientifically established thresholds based upon the amount of allergen 
remaining in the wine is the only reasonable approach. These thresholds should be 
based upon not only presence, but more importantly on levels that are problematic. 
Family Winemakers of California is appreciative of the opportunity to comment on the 
proposed rule and is available for any follow-up questions you might have.

2025-0002; Notices No. 238 – Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear colleagues in the Unites States Enquiry Point,  
The United Kingdom appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to The Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 238 
on Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages notified to 
the WTO TBT Committee under G/TBT/N/USA/2183, G/TBT/N/USA/2183/Add.1.  
The United Kingdom fully supports TTB's efforts to ensure that consumers have the relevant 
product information to make informed decisions.  
Notice No. 238 on Major Food Allergen Labelling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
• In the UK, food businesses must inform consumers under food law if they use any of 
the 14 Allergens as ingredients in the food and drink they provide and this applies to 
alcoholic drinks for both prepacked (bottled or canned) or those served in a glass. This 
includes sulphites and sulphur dioxide, which are among the 14 allergens and are 
commonly found in alcoholic drinks. 
• Alcoholic drinks with more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol do not require an 
ingredients list. In this case, the presence of any of the 14 allergens which are present 
and not clear from the name of the food needs to be indicated. For example, a bottle 
of wine must have a statement such as: ‘Contains: sulphites, milk and egg. 
• The United Kingdom appreciates TTB’s approach regarding allergens labelling for 
distilled spirits. As stated in the Notice, the production of spirits involves the distillation 
of raw materials in such a way that no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the 
distilled product or distilled ingredient. I n the UK view it is therefore appropriate that 
the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply to major food allergens used before 
the distillation process.  
• We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing 
protein are added to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food 
allergens are listed on the label. 
• In addition, we would request that the US consider allowing operators to exhaust all 
their stock which was put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. 
The United Kingdom remains firmly committed to ensuring consumers have access to clear 
and relevant product information and appreciate the US consideration of the above comments.

A. INTRODUCTION 
Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) represents the wine companies in the industry and trade in the 
European Union. Its members produce and market the vast majority of quality European wines, with and without 
a geographical indication, and account for over 90% of European wine exports. Micr o and small and medium -
sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU wine sector, representing more than 9 9% of wine 
companies. 
In 2024, European wines accounted for approximately 64% of the volume and 78% of the value of total U.S. wine 
imports. That year, the European Union exported an estimated €4.9 billion worth of wine to the United States . 
This robust transatlantic trade reflects the enduring demand for European wines by US consumers.  
CEEV thanks the U.S. authorities for the opportunity to comment on Notice No. 238 (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003), 
which proposes mandatory labelling of major food allergens in wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. 
B. CEEV COMMENTS 
CEEV shares TTB’s commitment to improving consumer access to product information and supporting informed 
decision-making. In this spirit, we offer constructive input to help ensure that any future allergen labelling 
requirements appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of wine. 
CEEV believes that the proposed approach to allergen disclosure should be adapted to account for the particular 
role of processing aids in winemaking, the limited space available on wine labels, and the need for consistency 
with international standards. Wi thout such adjustments, the TTB’s proposal risks placing disproportionate 
burdens on EU wine producers, especially small and medium -sized enterprises , who rely on established 
international practices that ensure consumer safety without requiring mandatory labelling of allergens that are 
no longer present in the final product. 
In this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: 
 
1. Allergen disclosure for processing aids – presence approach and threshold 
CEEV raises concerns over the TTB’s intention to introduce compulsory disclosure of processing aids derived 
from major food allergens, determined by their “use” rather than by their “presence” in the final product.  
This measure would disproportionately affect wine products, particularly those utili sing albumen, isinglass, or 
casein as fining or clarifying agents, substances commonly used in winemaking, when they have been removed 
prior to bottling. 
CEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  
Notice No. 238 - Major Food Allergen Labeling for 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages    
 
 
 
The principle of “presence” is the basis hosen at international and at EU levels: 
- Under the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), major allergens 
“shall always be declared as allergenic food using the specified name in addition to or as part of the 
ingredient name when intentionally present in the food”.  The same Codex Standard defines processing 
aids as “a substance or material, not including apparatus or utensils, and not consumed as a food 
ingredient by itself, intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or its ingredients, to fulfil 
a certain technological purpose during treatment or pr ocessing and which may result in the non -
intentional but unavoidable presence of residues or derivatives in the final product”. 
- EU legislation  provides for Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011  on of food information to consumers, that 
requires the declaration of any ingredient or processing aid used in the manufacture or preparation of 
a food and still present in the finished product.  
In line with these principles, EU wine producers follow rigorous filtration techniques and good manufacturing 
practices, especially during fining and clarification, to minimise or eliminate allergenic residues before the wine 
reaches consumers. These practices are guided by resolutions from the International Organisation of Vine and 
Wine (OIV), such as: 
− OIV/OENO 427 -2010, which established the framework for identifying allergenic residues in wine, 
particularly those originating from protein-based fining agents. 
− OIV/OENO 520-2014, the Code of Good Fining Practices for Wine, which recommends best practices to 
avoid residual allergens. 
− OIV/SECSAN 709-2022, which updated analytical criteria to ensure precise detection and quantification 
of allergens, reinforcing food safety and consumer protection. 
 
Therefore, CEEV requests the TTB not to require allergen labelling for processing aids  for wine based on their 
use, instead of their presence . The “presence” approach for allergen declaration, ensures high levels of 
consumer protection.  
Additionally, CEEV request TTB to propose  a presence threshold that would trigger disclosure of major food 
allergens.  
 
2. Allergen labelling terminology 
CEEV requests the TTB to adopt the term “Contains:” followed by the name of the food source from which each 
major allergen is derived, in place of the more generic phrase “Contains Major Food Allergens.” 
CEEV considers that this terminology would offer greater clarity and legibility for U.S. consumers, consistent 
with existing labelling practices for health -sensitive ingredients such sulphites. The term “Contains” is already 
widely used and understood in the U.S. market . In addition, the use of this wording would align U.S. allergen 
labelling requirements for wine with internationally recognised standards, notably the Codex General Standard 
for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985).  
Under the European Union legislative framework, Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011  on food information to 
consumers, it is stipulated that if a food product does not include an ingredient list, any allergen present must 
be indicated using the word ""contains"" followed by the name of the allergen. 
These established international frameworks ensure strong consumer protection and promote regulatory 
consistency across markets. Aligning with them facilitates clear communication to consumers and helps avoid 
unnecessary barriers to market access for EU wine exporters, while also preventing complications for reciprocal 
trade by U.S. producers abroad. 
  
 
 
3. Certificate of Label Approval applications 
Considering the variability of wine, CEEV is in favor of the TTB’s proposed exemption from requiring new COLA 
when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required statement of major 
food allergens. 
 
4. Implementation period 
CEEV supports the TTB’s proposed five-year phase-in period as a reasonable timeframe for wine companies to 
adapt to the new requirements. 
In addition, CEEV requests the TTB that, should the rulemaking under Notice No. 237 – Alcohol Facts Statements 
in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages be adopted, its effective date be aligned with that

Notice
 
238:
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen
 
Labeling
 
for
 
Wines,
 
Distilled
 
Spirits
 
and
 
Malt
 
Beverages
  Background   In  February  2022,  the  Department  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation  with  the  Department  of  Justice  
and
 
the
 
Federal
 
Trade
 
Commission,
 
released
 
a
 
report
 
on
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
markets
 
for
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
Competition
 
Report's
 
findings
 
was
 
that
 
“[r]egulatory
 
proposals
 
that
 
could
 
serve
 
public
 
health
 
and
 
foster
 
competition
 
by
 
providing
 
information
 
to
 
consumers,
 
such
 
as
 
mandatory
 
allergen,
 
nutrition,
 
and
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
proposals,
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
implemented.” 
[
The
 
Competition
 
Report
 
made
 
some
 
labeling
 
recommendations,
 
including
 
a
 
recommendation
 
that
 
TTB
 
“should
 
revive
 
or
 
initiate
 
rulemaking
 
proposing
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
and
 
mandatory
 
information
 
on
 
alcohol
 
content,
 
nutritional
 
content,
 
and
 
appropriate
 
serving
 
sizes.”
  On  January  31,  2024,  TTB  issued  Notice  No.  232,  which  announced  two  virtual  listening  
sessions
 
and
 
the
 
opening
 
of
 
a
 
public
 
docket
 
to
 
receive
 
written
 
comments
 
on
 
the
 
labeling
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
with
 
per-serving
 
alcohol
 
and
 
nutritional
 
information,
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
and/or
 
ingredients.
 
WineAmerica
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
listening
 
sessions
 
and
 
made
 
it
 
clear
 
that
 
the
 
preferred
 
disclosure
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
labeling
 
proposals
 
would
 
be
 
off
 
label.
 
  TTB  is  proposing  rules  for  the  mandatory  labeling  of  major  food  allergens  used  in  the  production  
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages.
 
Consistent
 
with
 
the
 
FALCPA
 
House
 
committee
 
report
 
and
 
TTB's
 
statutory
 
mandate
 
under
 
the
 
FAA
 
Act
 
to
 
promulgate
 
regulations
 
ensuring
 
that
 
consumers
 
receive
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
identity
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages,
 
TTB
 
believes
 
that
 
alcohol
 
beverage  labels  should  provide  consumers  with  sufficient  information  about  the  use  of  major  
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
so
 
that
 
consumers
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
may
 
make
 
an
 
informed
 
decision
 
as
 
to
 
whether
 
consumption
 
of
 
a
 
particular
 
beverage
 
may
 
pose
 
a
 
risk
 
of
 
an
 
allergic
 
reaction.
  Specific  Comments   Should  TTB  adopt  the  proposed  wording  of  the  major  food  allergen  statement  (“Contains  major  
food
 
allergen(s)”
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
colon
 
and
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
food
 
source
 
from
 
which
 
each
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
is
 
derived)?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  such  a  disclosure  only  if  there  is  a  detectable  trace  of  the  
potential
 
allergen
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
Quite
 
often
 
wineries
 
will
 
use
 
certain
 
fining
 
and
 
filtering
 
agents
 
that
 
will
 
have
 
no
 
detectable
 
trace
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  food  allergens  within  a  voluntary  ingredient  statement  
on
 
labels
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
  Producers  that  wish  to  disclose  that  information  should  have  this  option.   If  mandatory  ingredient  labeling  is  ultimately  adopted,  should  TTB  allow  the  inclusion  of  major  
food
 
allergens
 
in
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
ingredients
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 
to
 
a
 
separate
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement?
 
If
 
mandatory
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
is
 
ultimately
 
adopted,
 
should
 
TTB
 
use
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens,
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA's
 
approach?
 
Should
 
TTB
 
limit
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
only
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
  If  ingredient  labeling  is  eventually  adopted,  WineAmerica  supports  the  use  of  one  statement  in  
an
 
off
 
label
 
disclosure
 
as
 
one
 
option.
  Should  other  ingredients  that  are  required  to  be  disclosed  under  current  TTB  regulations  (FD&C  
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
one
 
statement
 
on
 
the
 
label?
 
If
 
so,
 
should
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
a
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
that
 
includes
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
 
(For
 
example,
 
“Contains
 
egg
 
and
 
sulfites”).
 
Or
 
should
 
the
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
be
 
identified
 
as
 
such,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
ingredients
 
listed
 
separately
 
(for
 
example,
 
“Contains
 
Major
 
Food
 
Allergen:
 
egg.
 
Contains
 
sulfites”)?
 
Should
 
another
 
statement
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
ingredients
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
under
 
current
 
TTB
 
regulations
 
(FD&C
 
Yellow
 
No.
 
5,
 
cochineal
 
extract
 
or
 
carmine,
 
sulfites,
 
and
 
aspartame)
 
to
 
differentiate
 
from
 
the
 
“Contains”
 
statement
 
for
 
major
 
food
 
allergens?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  one  disclosure  statement,  if  there  are  any  detectable  allergens  
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Would  requiring  all  mandatory  disclosures  to  be  in  one  place  on  the  label,  including  the  
proposed
 
major
 
food
 
allergen
 
statement,
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
find
 
this
 
information?
 
Would
 
such
 
a
 
requirement
 
impose
 
additional
 
costs
 
or
 
regulatory
 
burdens
 
on
 
industry
 
members
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
allowing
 
the
 
mandatory
 
disclosures
 
to
 
appear
 
separately?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  all  mandatory  disclosures  in  one  place  on  the  label,  but  this  
premise
 
is
 
exactly
 
why
 
the
 
off
 
label
 
disclosure
 
of
 
mandatory
 
information
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
solution.
 
This
 
will
 
avoid
 
clutter
 
on
 
the
 
label,
 
which
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
consumer
 
confusion.
 
There
 
would
 
be
 
additional
 
costs
 
in
 
changing
 
any
 
labeling
 
of
 
a
 
product.
 
It
 
is
 
estimated
 
that
 
changing
 
each
 
individual
 
label
 
could
 
cost
 
up
 
to
 
$1600.
 
An
 
off
 
label
 
solution
 
would
 
be
 
most
 
cost
 
effective
 
for
 
wineries,
 
particularly
 
if
 
a
 
new
 
COLA
 
is
 
not
 
required.
  Should  TTB  mandate  specific  placement,  type  size,  and  presentation  requirements  for  major  
allergen
 
labeling
 
statements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
requirements
 
already
 
applicable
 
to
 
all
 
mandatory
 
information
 
on
 
alcohol
 
beverage
 
labels?
 
For
 
example,
 
should
 
the
 
required
 
allergen
 
disclosure
 
statement
 
be
 
set
 
off
 
by
 
a
 
box?
 
Or,
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
practicable,
 
should
 
TTB
 
mandate
 
formatting
 
consistent
 
with
 
FDA
 
requirements
 
for
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling?
  WineAmerica  would  be  in  favor  of  a  type  size  that  would  match  the  requirements  for  other  
statements
 
required
 
on
 
a
 
wine
 
label,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
alcohol
 
content
 
and
 
the
 
sulfite
 
statement.
 
The
 
TTB
 
should
 
require
 
disclosure
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
format
 
or
 
off
 
label
 
through
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
other
 
web
 
based
 
disclosure.
  Other  Comments   Wine  is  a  unique,  value  added  agricultural  product.  It  is  made  in  all  fifty  states  by  nearly  11,000  
wine
 
producers.
 
The
 
wine
 
industry
 
provides
 
$323
 
billion
 
in
 
economic
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
economy.
 
Wine
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
produced
 
once
 
a
 
year
 
and
 
is
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
other
 
environmental
 
factors.
 
Wine
 
is
 
also
 
unique
 
because
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
follow
 
a
 
recipe
 
or
 
formula.
 
There
 
will
 
be
 
times
 
where
 
wine
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
additives
 
and
 
other
 
agents
 
to
 
filter
 
and
 
finish
 
the
 
wine.
 
These
 
are
 
almost
 
never
 
detectable
  
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  WineAmerica  is  in  favor  of  both  allergen  and  ingredient  disclosures,  as  long  as  it  is  done  in  a  
way
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
detriment
 
to
 
the
 
American
 
wine
 
industry.
 
Only
 
agents
 
that
 
are
 
detectable
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product
 
should
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
disclosed
 
by
 
a
 
producer.
 
Additionally,
 
as
 
we
 
stated
 
in
 
our
 
comments
 
for
 
Notice
 
237,
 
an
 
off
 
label,
 
web
 
based
 
disclosure
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
option
 
for
 
the
 
wine
 
industry.
 
This
 
is
 
already
 
occurring
 
in
 
the
 
European
 
Union
 
and
 
should
 
naturally
 
be
 
an
 
option
 
for
 
our
 
producers.
  The  American  wine  industry  is  unique  in  that  it  is  truly  nationwide  in  both  production  and  
consumption,
 
and
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
wine
 
producers
 
are
 
small
 
family
 
farms
 
with
 
limited
 
resources.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
WineAmerica
 
proposes
 
that
 
any
 
potential
 
changes
 
take
 
that
 
into
 
account,
 
such
 
as
 
allowing
 
off-label
 
options
 
to
 
fulfill
 
any
 
requirements.
  WineAmerica  would  like  to  thank  TTB  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  proposed

Comment on Proposed Rule: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0003) 
 
The undersigned organizations call on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to finalize 
the proposed rule mandating on-package labeling major food allergens and to propose a rule requiring full 
labeling of all ingredients. These rules will be a step forward, as current alcohol labels do not provide the 
information that consumers with food allergies need to make informed purchasing and consumption 
decisions. 
 
We commend TTB for issuing a proposed rule that would greatly improve transparency and protect 
consumers with food allergies by requiring labeling of the Top 9 major food allergens without exemption 
for processing aids. The rule could be strengthened by specifying where the allergen disclosure should 
appear, outlining specific formatting requirements, and requiring species specific disclosure for the 
labeling of finfish.  
Major allergen labeling on alcohol is important because roughly 11% of U.S. adults have food allergies1 
and many alcoholic beverages contain major allergens, such as wheat in many beers, milk and nuts in 
liqueurs, and even fish and eggs used as processing aids in wine.2 Currently, consumers with food 
allergies have no way of knowing if they can safely consume alcoholic beverages because neither 
ingredient lists, nor major allergen labeling are required.  
Consumers desire this information and would use it when making purchasing decisions. In a March 2024 
poll of 1,509 adults who drink alcohol (commissioned by CSPI and conducted by Big Village), strong 
majorities of consumers said that allergen information (79%) and ingredients (88%) would be at least 
somewhat important for deciding whether to purchase a particular alcoholic beverage.3  
 
TTB should make clear in the final rule that this vital safety information should never be provided solely 
via QR code, as this would specifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones 
or similar technology (including those who are older or living rurally).  
Separately, TTB should publish a rule mandating full ingredients labeling on-package for all alcoholic 
beverages. This would further improve transparency on alcoholic products and provide additional 
protection for consumers with allergies to foods outside the Top 9 major food allergens. 
Alcohol should no longer be exempt from the basic labeling of allergens that consumers with allergies can 
rely upon for nearly all other foods and beverages. To ensure timely consumer access to this important 
information, the final rule should adopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year 
period proposed. 
 
We urge TTB to prioritize transparency by not only finalizing the proposed Major Food Allergen 
Labeling rule, but also by proposing a rule to mandate ingredients labeling on alcohol to ensure that 
Americans with food allergies can identify other ingredients that trigger allergy beyond the major food 
allergens.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including 
many small and family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of 
the nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   Wine Institute is 
committed to sound public policy at every level .  To that end, we provide the following 
comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 23 8: Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (“NPRM 238”). 
 
Science-based major food allergen labeling that properly identifies products containing 
allergenic protein capable of causing an adverse reaction can be beneficial for consumers 
with allergies.  Accordingly, we support the current interim rule which provides for voluntary 
labeling of major food allergens in wine.  That said, we are concerned that what TTB proposes 
in NPRM 238—which does not base mandatory labeling on the presence of allergenic protein 
at certain levels or at all—will depart from international standards, cause consumer 
confusion and other  unintended consequences, and will present enforcement issues and 
potential trade distortions that negatively impact US wineries.   
 
The wine marketplace is distinct in terms of both the number of producers and unique wines 
available.  A ccording to TTB, there are currently more than 17,500 bonded wine producers 
across the US and approximately 6,300 of them are in California.  Like our membership, the 
overwhelming majority of these are small, family -owned wineries that operate in a heavily  
regulated industry with correspondingly high costs  in establishing and maintaining their 
businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations be fiscally responsible, 
reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only if leg itimate public 
Page 2 of 6  
goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  We respectfully request that TTB 
consider our comments fully given that NPRM 238 constitutes a “significant regulatory action” 
that will impose new financial and operational burdens on California’s many great wineries. 
 
1. Allergen Labeling and Unique Aspects of Wine 
 
Pursuant to the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (“FALCPA”), food 
products that contain an ingredient that bears or contains a major food allergen (i.e., milk, egg, 
fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame ) must include 
this information on their labels unless the food ingredient does not cause an allergic response 
that poses a risk to human health or does not contain allergenic protein.   FALCPA does not 
apply to alcohol beverages that TTB regulate s under the F ederal Alcohol Administration  Act 
(“FAA Act”).  Instead, consistent with a 1987 Memorand um of  Understanding (“MOU”) , TTB 
worked with FDA in promulgation NPRM 238.  As TTB notes, however, the proposed regulations 
do not necessarily represent the views of FDA regarding allergen labeling or the requirements 
of FALCPA. 
 
Federal winemaking regulations authorize and limit the use of certain materials and processes 
for the treatment of wine.
1  These treatments include filtering, clarifying, or purifying the wine 
to remove  cloudiness, precipitation, or undesirable odors and flavors .  As TTB recognizes, 
some of these materials are processing aids derived from major food allergens.  For example, 
albumen (egg white) is approved as a fining agent for wine, and isinglass (a gelatin derived from 
fish) and casein (derived from milk) are approved to clarify wine  
 
Processing aids perform a function during production and are either removed entirely from the 
final product by filtration or remain in only trace amounts that are not always detectible.  Fining 
agents such as eggs and milk have been used in wine production for millennia with few, if any, 
substantiated adverse reactions from allergy sufferers.  And not all wines use these approved 
materials.  A winemaker will make a conscious decision to use a particular fining agent for the 
effect that it will have on the wine ; in most cases there are no suitable alternatives to these 
agents, as each agent has a very specific impact on the resultant wine.   It is also worth noting 
that due to legal drinking age regulations, the at-risk population under consideration should be 
only those members of the population over the age of 21 years.   Studies have shown that the 
vast majority of milk and egg allergy sufferers have outgrown their allergies by the age of 21. 
 
In sum, while TTB may work with FDA to inform a proposed rule for allergen labeling, TTB may 
also take into consideration aspects that are unique to wine and other alcohol beverage 
products over which it has jurisdiction under the FAA Act  and adopt appropriate measures 
such as establishing threshold levels for any allergens (i.e., a value below which it is unlikely 
that a food allergic individual would experience an adverse effect).   
 
 
 
 
1 27 CFR 24.246. Page 3 of 6  
 
 
2. TTB Should Establish and Adopt Thresholds Before Imposing Mandatory Allergen 
Labeling 
 
TTB is not proposing any thresholds that would trigger disclosure of major food allergens.  
Instead, the proposed rule provides that all major food allergens and proteins derived from the 
major food allergens used in production  must be declared on the beverage label, unless an 
approved petition for exemption covers the product or class of products or they otherwise fall 
under an applicable exception.  TTB states that if FDA establishes thresholds in the future, TTB 
will reconsider its policy on this issue.   In short, TTB ’s approach is based on use —regardless 
of whether any proteins derived from a major food allergen remain in the final product—rather 
than their presence in the product.   As described below, we  have concerns about this “use” 
rather than “presence” approach, and the absence of any thresholds. 
 
A Vast Majority of Countries Adopt “Presence” Rather Than “Use” for Allergen Labeling 
Contrary to what TTB proposes, Codex Alimentarius  and the OIV recommend “presence” and 
not “use ” as the trigger for allergen labeling.
2  Indeed, “presence” is almost universally the 
adopted standard.  We found almost 60 countries, including the 27 EU member states , that 
adopt “presence” as the standard. 3   We found only two counties that may take the “use” 
approach that TTB proposes.4   
 
Notably, the 27 EU member states  and at least six other countries  exempt isinglass from 
mandatory allergen labeling on alcohol beverages  after the European Foo d Safety Authority 
issued an opinion finding it was  not very likely that isinglass  used as clarifying agent in beer 
would trigger a severe allergic reaction in susceptible individuals  under the conditions of 
production and use specified in the application for exemption.   Moreover, Health Canada—a 
federal department responsible for public health—issued the following  position on fining 
agents in 2012:   
 
Although wines may be manufactured using allergen- or gluten-derived fining 
agents, mainly ovalbumin (protein from egg), casein (protein from milk) and, 
to a lesser extent, isinglass (protein from fish), the enhanced labelling

requirements are only triggered under the Regulations if the protein, or a 
modified protein, including any protein fraction, from an allergen source is 
present in the finished product. 
After conducting a thorough review of the current available scientific 
information, Health Canada scientists have concluded that the use of 
allergen-derived fining agents does not normally result in any appreciable 
amount of protein from food allergens remaining in the wine, particularly when 
usual manufacturing practices such as filtration steps are employed.  As such, 
the use of food allergen -derived fining agents in wine production, following 
good manufacturing practices, is not expected to produce wine that would 
pose a risk to egg, milk, or fish allergic consumers.  Therefore, in most cases 
of allergen-derived fining agent use, the new labelling regulations for priority 
allergens would not be triggered.

What TTB proposes—i.e., labeling allergens based on use rather than presence—runs counter 
to the approach that an overwhelming majority of countries adopt for allergen labeling. 
 
On a similar note , and here in the US,  the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program 
(FARRP) at the University of Nebraska asserts that “it is now well -documented that food -
allergic individuals have threshold doses below which they will not experience adverse 
reactions.”6  That is one reason why FARRP concludes: “Regulatory guidance on thresholds for 
allergenic foods is sorely needed to improve the quality of life for food-allergic consumers and 
to focus limited regulatory resources on the genuine risks that exist to these consumers.”7  We 
agree.  We also agree with FARRP’s positions that thresholds must be scientifically based, and 
sufficient evidence exists to allow the development of regulatory thresholds for some of the 
most hazardous allergenic foods.
8 
 
Without Thresholds, Consumers Could be Misled 
TTB proposes labeling a wine with “ Contains Major Food Allergen ” any time major food 
allergens or proteins derived from major food allergens are used in production, even if they are 
used only as  processing aid s and do not remain in the final product  at all or only in trace 
amounts.  This proposed rule could mislead consumers and present wineries with conflicting 
regulations. 
 
Federal and state laws prohibit false and misleading statements including on wine labels.
9   In 
many instances, analysis of fined wines will not detect residues of processing aids  derived

 Page 5 of 6  
from food allergens  and that get filtered out.  For example, if casein ( milk) is used to  treat a 
wine it will trigger the proposed mandatory labeling  “Contains Major Food Allergen: m ilk.”  If 
an analysis is done on this wine and milk protein residues are not found—which is entirely 
plausible—the labeling  declaration potentially constitutes a false or  misleading statement  
because it does not “contain”  milk or milk proteins .  In fact, TTB expresses a similar concern 
when it explains why it is not proposing  advisory labeling such as  “May Contain” statements: 
“TTB is concerned that allergen advisory labeling could be used as substitute for adherence to 
current good manufacturing practices and could be misleading.” 
 
Instead, T TB proposes that an industry member may  include the added parenthetical 
“(processing aid),” if applicable, so the full declaration in that scenario could be: “Contains 
Major Food Allergen: milk (processing aid).”  It seems unlikely, however, that many if not most 
consumers understand what the term “processing aid”  means.  In addition, since including 
“(processing aid) ” is optional, it may not always appear , even when applicable.  The better 
solution would be for TTB to reconsider the proposed rule and establish and adopt thresholds 
so that actual presence of allergenic proteins at quantifiable and problematic amounts trigger 
mandatory labeling. An alternative approach is to use the phrase “Processed with [food 
allergen]” if TTB determines that a warning is required.  This does not claim the presence of the 
allergen, but simply notes the allergenic material was used in processing the wine. 
 
There is also a related concern that a zero-tolerance environment will only become 
increasingly challenging as analytical technology becomes more sensitive, permitting 
vanishingly low and inconsequential levels of processing aids and other components to be 
detected.  Science-based thresholds will help to improve the information provided to 
consumers so that they can make clear decisions about what foods or beverages they should 
avoid, and to which risks they are exposed .  Science-based thresholds will also allow 
producers to more accurately meet the public policy goals of allergen labeling. 
 
Last, there may be unintended consequences  from adopting a “use” standard for labeling 
wines.  For example, a consumer who is allergic to milk may have consumed a given wine over 
many years and suddenly finds it now states “Contains Major Food Allergen: milk.”  That 
individual may decide since they have consumed  the wine for years without  issue, they will 
continue to consume it.  Current scientific and observational data suggests that if the wine has 
been fined according to good practices , that person will not suffer an allergic reaction after 
drinking the wine.  This may embolden them to consume other foods that contain milk allergen 
labeling and do pose a risk to that consumer.  This is another way in which a “use” approach 
may not serve consumers well. 
 
A “Use” Standard Will Present Enforcement Challenges and Potential Trade Distortions 
Since a “non-detect” result by analysis does  not mean that potential allergens have  not been 
used in making any given wine, access to production records would be necessary to confirm 
what was used in production.  This would require additional TTB resources and time to 
 
or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, 
scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression”).  Page 6 of 6  
investigate and it can only be done for domestically produced wine s and not for imported 
products.   If they have used potential allergens in production, winemakers exporting to the US 
will likely know that any remaining proteins are below the limit of analytical detection and may 
therefore choose to not declare something that lab analysis cannot detect.  US producers will 
then be placed at a disadvantage in the US market compared with imported products. 
 
3. A Five-Year Implementation Period is Reasonable and Necessary  if a Final Rule 
Issues 
 
TTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal 
Register.  While we suggest that TTB first undertake work and review research to establish and 
adopt reasonable thresholds that would trigger allergen labeling, we agree with the proposed 
five-year compliance period for any final rule and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing it.  
Five years would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new 
labeling processes which will help minimize —but not eliminate —financial and operational  
burdens.  It would allow ample time for public and stakeholder education and regulatory 
guidance.  It would also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, 
and advertising material and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in another rulemaking, 
five years is within the typical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according to an 
FDA regulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.
10   
 
We also agree with TTB ’s proposal that industry members should not be required to submit 
new COLA applications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion of a 
statement of major food allergens.   That too will help alleviate some of the ongoing financial 
and operational burdens  which is important given the proposed rule is considered a 
“significant regulatory action.”

In closing, Wine Institute thanks TTB for the opportunity to comment on the issues raised in 
NPRM 238.  We would be pleased to respond to any follow-up questions that TTB might have 
concerning our comments.

RE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238; Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
To whom it may concern: 
 
As the association for the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) industry, including makers of food, 
beverage, personal care, and household products, the Consumer Brands Association champions 
the industry that makes the products you choose and the brands you trust. From household and 
personal care to food and beverage products, the consumer  packaged goods (CPG) industry 
plays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy, contributing $2.5 trillion to U.S. GDP and 
supporting 22.3 million American jobs. Consumer Brands advocates for uniform, workable, and 
durable regulatory frameworks that are informed by risk -based science, promote consumer 
choice, and build consumer trust across the sectors we represent. As such, we appreciate the 
opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol, and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB or the 
Agency) proposed rule titled, “Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages.” (Proposed Rule).  
 
As TTB develops labelling standards for most wine, spirits and malt beverages, we encourage it 
to allow  for the use of digital technologies to share labelling information with consumers. 
Succinctly, we urge the agency to be flexible in how labeling information is provided, 
including recognizing the valuable role that digital disclosure tools like SmartLabel can 
provide in facilitating accurate and up -to-date information ultimately leading to greater 
transparency for consumers.   
 
Introduction 
 
SmartLabel® by Consumer Brands Association is a nimble, adaptable digital platform launched 
in 2015 by brand owners and grocery retailers to give consumers access to more detailed product 
information than could ever fit on a package. SmartLabel serves as the defacto standard for  
consumer transparency and allows brands to display state and federally mandated and voluntary 
label information . Currently 80 parent companies participate in the SmartLabel program, 
representing more than 1,000 brands and over 100,000 products across all CPG categories, the 
largest being food and beverage. SmartLabel data is maintained by the participating brands who 
can provide  up-to-date product information with the click of a button. SmartLabel can easily 
accommodate the addition of data for wine, spirits and malt beverages.  
 
Further, SmartLabel can augment  federally required nutritional, ingredient , and allergen 
information with voluntary details that go beyond the package label such as ingredient definitions 
and sourcing  information, links to allergy prevention and management resources , as well as  SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025

sustainability attributes and practices.  Much of the voluntary information in SmartLabel spans 
nutrition, product claims,  certifications, and disclosures that consumers really care about.  
Consumers interacted with the SmartLabel platform over 22 million times in calendar year 2024. 
A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands 
Association found that consumers most often view the nutrition, ingredient , and allergen 
information on the SmartLabel pages. The survey also found that one-third of consumers have 
used SmartLabel and/or scanned a QR code to access product information  and 97% of those  
have used SmartLabel more than once. Almost six in ten (59%) American adults are likely to trust 
brands that feature SmartLabel, and more than half (55%) of consumers believe that integrating 
product information with SmartLabel will improve their impression of the brand. Consequently, 
SmartLabel food labeling provides the product information consumers seek to make informed 
decisions about the CPG products they purchase. 
 
SmartLabel Standardizes the Product Data Display 
 
SmartLabel complies with GS1 data standards (sourced via the Global Data Synchronisation 
Network or GDSN) for all attributes displayed on the platform and is a single source of up-to-date 
and accurate CPG product details because the data is directly owned, managed, updated, and 
hosted by the brand owner or the brand owner’s solution provider. Further, SmartLabel utilizes a 
uniform display and structure, which facilitates the ability of consumers to quickly and easily find 
the information they are seeking.  
 
SmartLabel can play an important role in providing accurate and up-to-date product information 
about alcoholic beverages to consumers.  SmartLabel data is displayed in a consistent 5 -tab 
template for all product categories  (Food and Beverage, Household Cleaning, Personal Care, 
Over-the-Counter Medications, Dietary Supplements and Pet Food)  and includes 
all federally mandated information that would be required to appear on the label  
(except for date code labeling for infant formula, which must be provided for the 
specific packaged product). For food and beverage products, the tabs are Nutrition, 
Ingredients, Allergens, About this Product (most of the voluntary information, 
including claims, resides on this tab) and Company, Brand & Sustainability.

The product image in the header of all SmartLabel pages can be clicked to display an enlarged 
image to aid consumers in determining if the product they have in hand matches the SmartLabel 
information. 
 
SmartLabel nutrition, ingredient, and allergen details are displayed in a consistent, readable 
template that mirrors the information on the packaging  and allows for variations in product 
formulations. The product image in the SmartLabel template header can be clicked to display an 
enlarged image of the package, which can be helpful for people with vision impairment. 
 
SmartLabel presents FDA mandatory information (nutrition information, ingredients, allergens, 
statement of identity, net quantity of contents, name and place of business, percent juice 
declaration and flavor labeling where applicable) in a consistent, easy to access and easy to read 
format. The SmartLabel program uses implementation manuals working with brands to provide 
information in accordance with applicable regulations for a consistent, reliable experience for 
consumers. For instances, the implementation manual for food and beverage prescribes that “the 
Nutrition Panel must exactly mirror what appears on the physical package for single column 
displays. ‘Exactly’ refers to all elements of the FDA’s Nutrition Facts label design including relative 
font sizes, indentations, alignment, and separation bar width. The Nutrition tab is not constrained 
by package size so the Nutrition Facts Panel should follow the FDA guidelines without truncation.” 
SmartLabel could implement a template that meets Alcohol/Serving Facts labelling requirements 
if any.  
 
The SmartLabel Trademark Licensing Agreement signed by all SmartLabel participants requires 
them to adhere to the specifications in the SmartLabel Food and Beverage Implementation 
Manual for the design and content in their SmartLabel pages. The program con ducts annual 
reviews of SmartLabel pages to make certain the data is consistent between the product 
packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page. Elements that do not comply with 
programmatic and / or regulatory requirements are identified, and brands are given a reasonable 
time frame to bring their pages into compliance.   
 
SmartLabel is Accessible 
 
SmartLabel product pages can be accessed easily in several different ways including 
smartphones, tablets, and computers – and allow users to view the information in an easily legible 
format regardless of device . SmartLabel pages appear in the browser and do not require any 
software to download or install to view SmartLabel.   
 
Consumers commonly use the native camera app on a smartphone or tablet to scan the 
SmartLabel branded QR code to reach the digital product information.  SmartLabel also offers a 
free application that can be downloaded for both iPhone and android smartphones. The app 
allows users to scan UPC barcodes for products that participate in SmartLabel. SmartLabel pages 
can also be searched and accessed using the Sm artLabel product database 
(https://SmartLabel.org/product-search) without access to the actual package. 
 
Given the ubiquity of smartphones and wide availability of broadband, consumers can readily 
access SmartLabel information by scanning the SmartLabel branded QR code. USDA’s 
Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS) has found that as of 2021, most Americans (97 percent) SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 4 of 10 
 
owned a smartphone of some kind.1 In particular, the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent 
of urban adults, 84 percent of suburban adults, and 80 percent of rural adults in America own a 
smartphone2. The Pew Research Center also found that 61 percent of individuals 65 and older  
own a smartphone.  
 
Similarly, QR code interactions increased by an estimated 6,200% between 2017 and 2021, with 
91% of consumers now having used a QR code at least once, and 87.1% of survey participants 
stating that QR codes are easy to use. 3 Moreover, internet access today is not the issue it once 
was. Today, 95% of American adults have reported that they use the internet.4  
 
Further, SmartLabel pages comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by 
the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Accessibility Initiative, which partners with 
organizations around the world to provide a high degree of internet usability for people with 
disabilities by: 
• ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility 
• developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and 
authoring tools 
• developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools 
• supporting education and outreach on web accessibility 
• coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the 
web 
• promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards 
 
The SmartLabel Template 
 
The SmartLabel landing page for food and beverage products is the Nutrition Tab, which 
replicates the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) on pack, including the FDA required formatting. In-
depth interviews from the 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands Association 
and FMI, revealed consumers found the product information in SmartLabel to be very clear, easy 
to navigate and easy to read. Consumers explained the digital rendering of the NFP in SmartLabel 
is easier to read than the NFP on-pack.

Ingredients are displayed on the second tab in descending order of predominance in a stacked, 
legible format. Many of the food and beverage implementors in SmartLabel also include voluntary 
information on ingredient definitions and functions , which can be accessed by clicking on the 
arrow next to the listed ingredient . The ingredients tab also supports information on ingredient 
sourcing and growing methods, providing consumers with valuable information about the products 
they consume.

The third tab, Allergens, displays a statement identifying the nine major food allergens under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Allergens contained in the product are listed in a stacked 
format, with the option for brands to also provide additional information on the composition of the 
allergen – for example, the allergen “milk” in a product might be composed of pasteurized milk 
and cream, dried milk , and cream cheese  – and links to allergy prevention and management 
resources. 
The fourth tab – About this Product  – displays voluntary information like claims, certifications, 
health and safety  warnings and product instructions. The fifth tab – Company, Brand & 
Sustainability – displays hyperlinks to the brand’s customer suppor t and website, company

website, Dietary Guidelines for Americans and USDA My Plate. The fifth tab is also used to display 
product sustainability attributes like How2Recycle , Recycle Check, CIRT  and hyperlinks to 
corporate sustainability practices. 
SmartLabel is a viable option for manufacturers to provide product information, both mandatory 
and voluntary, that may not be as readily available or in -depth on the product packaging. Other 
types of detailed product information that are available to consumers through SmartLabel that go 
beyond what is commonly available on the product packaging  include information about, 
bioengineered food declarations, product certifications, sustainability attributes, and company or 
brand information.  
 
Additionally, SmartLabel informs consumers that a product contains a known allergen and, if 
provided by the manufacturer, can go further and advise if the product was made in a shared 
facility or even on shared equipment for hyper-sensitive consumers. 
 
SmartLabel Facilitates Data Management  
 
For CPG manufacturers, the processes for managing digital product content generally run in 
parallel with the changes made to the physical label. Manufacturers need to determine when the 
updated product and its label will be in market to identify when it would be appropriate to circulate 
the updated online retail information. This determination does not follow a specific timeline  
because it is based on the estimated turnover rate of the product that is in commerce.  
 
Manufacturers can update SmartLabel to accommodate reformulations in near real time . 
Furthermore, SmartLabel displays the  date of the  information up date in the footer of each 
SmartLabel page: 
 
 
 
 
Consumer Research Validates SmartLabel as a Digital Transparency Tool 
 
Through consumer research , SmartLabel has confirmed that consumers expect the labeling 
information in SmartLabel to be consistent with the information on the label. As noted, the program 
SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 
July 9, 2025 
Page 8 of 10 
 
conducts annual reviews of SmartLabel pages to ensure the data is consistent between the 
product packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page.  
 
Consumer research conducted in 2023 by SmartLabel nationally with 1,000 respondents across 
all demographic groups found that 43% of consumers are very likely to access more product 
information online (compared to what is provided on the label).  
 
For reasons related to their family’s well-being, 80% of respondents said they would like to know 
more about products than what is usually  on the package label . When asked about shopping 
online, 80% of survey respondents said they seek more information about a product when 
shopping online than when shopping in-store. 
 
The same survey found that 84% of consumers said they believe product information directly from 
the manufacturer is most accurate. SmartLabel pages are populated directly by the brand owners. 
 
Consumers also sa id access to product information in SmartLabel is faster and easier  to read 
than the same information on the package label . The 5 -tab SmartLabel template serves as a 
standard and ensures consistency in the way product information is displayed  
 
Digital Disclosure Provides Benefits to Manufacturers and Consumers 
 
The benefits of digital labeling accrue to both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers demand 
transparency and value the detailed ingredient, nutrition and health information  in SmartLabel. 
They appreciate the consistency of the SmartLabel design, its organized layout and the ease of 
access. Moreover, providing information via off -label, electronic means benefit s consumers by 
ensuring they receive the most up -to-date, accurate, and more comprehensive information  
directly from the product manufacturers.  A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents 
conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands Association and FMI found that: 
• 58% of consumers look for SmartLabel on products  and 51% are likely to buy products 
featuring SmartLabel. 
• 60% of consumers are likely to trust brands that feature SmartLabel. 
• Accurate and up -to-date product information and detailed product information a re key 
purchase drivers. 26% of consumers are willing to pay more for products that offer 
additional information through SmartLabel.  
 
For brand owners, the primary benefit of using the electronic or digital link disclosure option is the 
ability for the industry to rapidly and efficiently update product information, therefore minimizing 
packaging costs and packaging obsolescence. Updates are influenced by numerous factors 
including reformulations, supplier driven changes, supply chain pressures, packaging inventory 
turnover as well as limited vendor resources. Electronic or digital disclosure provides flexibility for 
manufacturers to quickly address product changes as ingredient supplies are updated and 
modified. A nimble and adaptable tool allows for efficient communication and transparency, 
ultimately benefiting consumers. with minimal disruptions to both the manufacturer and 
consumers.  
With SmartLabel, brands don’t need to touch their packaging as often, since changes can be 
made to the SmartLabel page on the fly. When a change is made on the SmartLabel page, it will SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237

appear everywhere the page is hosted in real time – on the brand ecommerce pages and retail 
ecommerce sites. In other words, with SmartLabel, manufacturers only have to make a change 
once, instead of on multiple platforms. As important, the ability to make real-time corrections and 
provide real-time information can streamline and aid regulatory enforcement efforts associated 
with any new and mandatory labeling rules. 
 
GS1 Sunrise 2027 is Just Around the Corner 
 
SmartLabel is collaborating with GS1 US in prepara tion for Sunrise 2027 – the transition from 
UPC barcodes to 2D barcodes (Digital Links). With a single scan on a smartphone, a GS1 digital 
link-enabled SmartLabel QR code will allow consumers to access nutritional information, 
allergens, sustainability and sourcing data on the SmartLabel product page. That same QR code 
can be scanned at the point-of-sale (POS) checkout counter for price lookup and a variety of other 
supply chain processes related to inventory management and recall readiness. More information 
on GS1 Sunrise 2027 and 2D barcodes can be found here. A June 13, 2025 article in Packaging 
World described how brands are piloting 2D barcodes today in anticipation of Sunrise 2027.

TTB Proposal on Allergen Declaration in Alcoholic Beverage Labeling 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published the 
proposal (Notice No. 238) ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food allergens in 
alcoholic beverages. 
Comparison of the TTB proposal vs. the Official Mexican Standard NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, 
Alcoholic Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and Commercial Labeling: 
Pursuant to  Notice No. 238: Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, 
and Malt Beverages. 
Pursuant to NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014, Alcoholic 
Beverages. Sanitary Specifications. Sanitary and 
Commercial Labeling. 
Proposal to add the following legend to 
alcoholic beverage labeling: 
“Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"" 
followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is 
derived, for example, 
9. Labeling 
 
The labeling of the products covered by this 
Standard, in addition to complying with the 
provisions of the Regulations and other applicable 
legal provisions, shall be subject to the following: 
(…) 
“Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"" 
This wording differs from the current voluntary 
allergen declaration (interim rule,  T.D. TTB -53 
(71 FR 42260) which states that in alcoholic 
beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, 
primary allergens may be voluntarily declared 
on labels affix ed to the container. The 
declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of 
the food source of each allergen (e.g., 
""Contains: egg""). 
9.3 Mandatory Requirements. The following are 
mandatory sanitary and commercial information 
requirements: 
(…) 
9.3.7 Sanitary Information. 
 
9.3.7.7 List of ingredients. 
9.3.7.1.1 The list of ingredients must appear on the 
label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or 
creams and all these alcoholic beverages, which 
after distillation and/or before bottling use 
optional ingredient s and/or additives that cause 
hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy and are 
present in the final product. 
Definition of Major Food Allergen: 
 
""The proposed regulations define the term 
""major food allergen"" as any of the following: 
 
 Milk 
 Egg 
 Fish (e.g.,  bass, flounder, or cod) 
Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, 
or shrimp) 
 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or 
walnuts) 
 Wheat 
 Peanuts 
 Soybeans 
 Sesame 
 
The defined term also includes any food 
ingredient that contains protein derived from 
one of these nine foods or food groups, subject 
to certain exceptions. 
The following foods and ingredients have been 
shown to cause hypersensitivity and must always 
be declared: 
 
9.3.7.1.1.1 Cereals containing gluten, e.g.: wheat, 
rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybr idized strains, 
and products thereof; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.2 Egg and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.3 Peanut and its products; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.4 Soy and its products, with the 
exception of soybean oil; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.5 Milk and dairy products, including 
lactose; 
 
9.3.7.1.1.6 Tree nuts and their derivatives, and 
 
9.3.7.1.1.7 Sulfite in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or 
more. 
Compliance Period: The TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date a final rule 
resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register. 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that food allergens must be declared in the 
ingredient list only if they are present in the final product, without the need for a specific warning, 
and only in liqueurs or creams, cocktails, and prepared beverages. 
On the other hand, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the example 
""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". Furthermore, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim rule, T.D. TTB-53 
(71 FR 42260)) establishes that in alcoholic beverages such as wines and distilled spirits, p rimary 
allergens may be voluntarily declared on labels.  The declaration must consist of the word 
""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the food source of each allergen (e.g., ""Contains: 
egg""). However, the TTB proposal seeks to make allergen declaration mandatory. It should be noted 
that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in distilled alcoholic beverages, 
provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes a distillation process that completely 
removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled product or ingredient. 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including 
the following: 
 “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived; or 
 A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that adding 
an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real benefit to the 
consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which would go against 
Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks 
to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers. The CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the 
General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985), recommends that allergen 
declaration be preferably done within the ingredient list.  In cases where a separate declaration is 
required, it should be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the 
allergen and, when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.  The 
interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily 
declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include the word ""Contains"", 
followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as ""Contains: egg"". It is proposed 
that the TTB consider the possibility of declaring major allergens as part of the ingredient list, which 
is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients that 
cause hypersensitivity and are present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for 
the consumer to understand and would be in line with the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developme nt (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and that 
excessive information can confuse the consumer. If it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic beverage labeling, it 
is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to provide additional information.  
This can be achieved through electronic labeling, using a QR code, a digital medium, or a website. 
This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited space for consumer information, presenting it 
in a friendly and easy-to-understand format. In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in 
regulatory provisions, and facilitates information reaching young people, a vulnerable g roup, to 
prevent harmful alcohol consumption.  It also allows for the development of educational and 
interactive content for the consumer.  Thus, consumers would be effectively informed without 
overloading alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement 
on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To clearly 
and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed that it be sufficient to include them in 
the product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name.  It is 
also proposed to consider the use of e lectronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to 
display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of  ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of 
the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient list, 
including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section.  It is also suggested to 
evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display detailed 
allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C 
Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) be required to be listed in one 
statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement 
that includes the major food allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the 
major food allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another statement be 
used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow 
No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” 
statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, as they 
can easily identify them on the label.  Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic labeling (QR 
codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding  overloading the 
physical product label. 
 5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including the 
proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this information? 
Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on industry members 
as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately? 
Requiring specific wording and location for allergen information on the label can create trade 
barriers and increase costs, negatively affecting the trade of alcoholic beverages.  Therefore, it is 
proposed that this information can be placed anywhere on the label.  According to studies by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), presenting too much information 
together can make it difficult for consumers to identify important data. To avoid this, it is suggested 
to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display 
additional allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements for major 
allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already applicable to all mandatory 
information on alcohol beverage l abels? For example, should the required allergen disclosure 
statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent practicable, should TTB mandate formatting 
consistent with FDA requirements for major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for allergen 
declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional costs for 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs could be considered 
a tec hnical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's 
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade 
barriers. This agreement establishes that technical regulations should  not be implemented that 
hinder international trade without valid justification in the legitimate objectives of member states. 
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1-1985): 
Provisions for Allergen Labeli ng of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established that the 
presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. Should a separate 
declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains ________"" (or an equivalent term) 
and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient list, when present.  This provision avoids 
the use of a more extensive legend, which could confuse the consumer. 
Conclusion: 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic beverages 
be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs and barriers to 
international trade.  Likewise, it is proposed that the declaration of major allergens in alcoholic 
beverages be limited to thei r inclusion in the ingredient list.  Should an additional declaration be 
required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the CODEX Alimentarius and the 
Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)), using only the legend 
""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a more extensive text. It is essential that 
the possibility of using electronic labeling (through QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to 
provide additional information or legends about ma jor allergens be considered.  This method 
facilitates access to relevant information for the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary 
regulatory and commercial burdens.

Subject: Comments on: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance, a strategic collaboration 
among companies and with  institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable 
development of Mezcal. Its purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by 
disseminating good practices, promoting joint projects and generating a positive impact on 
producing communities. With a focus on innovative  solutions, the Alliance seeks to 
accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that defines Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB for notifying its proposed regulation to the 
TBT Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade 
Organization, in accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that 
notifications of technical regulations sh ould occur at a stage where comments can be 
considered and modifications to the initial proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. 
published the proposal  ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food 
allergens in alcoholic beverages.  The TTB has proposed a five -year compliance period, 
starting from the date the final standard is published in the Federal Register. 
Under the current interim standard (T.D. TTB-53), major allergens in alcoholic beverages like 
wine and spirits may be voluntarily declared using the phrase “Contains: [allergen]”. 
However, the TTB now proposes making allergen labeling mandatory, with an exemption for 
distilled products whe re the distillation process fully removes all proteins, including 
allergens. It should be noted that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in  
distilled alcoholic beverages, provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes 
a distillation process that completely removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled 
product or ingredient. 
Furthermore, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the 
example ""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 stipulates that food allergens must be listed in the 
ingredient declaration only when they are present in the final product, and this requirement 
applies exclusively to liqueurs, creams, cocktails, and prepared alcoholic b everages. No 
specific allergen warning is mandated. 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement 
(“Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or 
allow alternative formats, including the following: 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which 
each major food allergen is derived; or 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or 
other language and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that 
adding an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real 
benefit to the consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for m anufacturers, 
importers, and distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, 
which would go against Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on 
Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers.  
Moreover, the CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the General Standard for the Labeling 
of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1 -1985), recommends that allergen declaration be preferably 
done within the ingredient list. In cases where a separate declaration is required, it sho uld 
be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the allergen and, 
when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.   
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and 
that excessive information can confuse the consumer. 
The interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to 
voluntarily declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include 
the word ""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as 
""Contains: egg"". It is proposed that the TTB consider s the possibility of declaring major 
allergens as part of the ingredient list, which is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic 
beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients t hat cause hypersensitivity and are 
present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word ""Contains"" followed by 
the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for the consumer to 
understand and would be in line with  the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
However, i f it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic 
beverage labelling, it is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to 
provide additional information. This can be achieved through electronic labelling, using a 
QR code, a digital medium, or a website. This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited 
space for consumer information, presenting it in a friendly and easy -to-understand format. 
In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in regulatory provisions, and facilitates 
information reaching young people, a vulnerable group, to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption. It also allows for the development of educational and interactive content for 
the consumer. Thus, consumers would be ef fectively informed without overloading 
alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To 
clearly and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed to include them in the 
product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name. It 
is also proposed to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or 
websites) to display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion 
of major food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major 
food allergen statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopt ed, 
should TTB use the “Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with  
FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient 
list, including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section. It is also 
suggested to evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digita l platforms, or 
websites) to display detailed allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical 
product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
be required to be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other 
ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement that includes the major food 
allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the major food 
allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major  Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another 
statement be used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, 
as they can easily identify them on the label. Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding 
overloading the physical product label. 
5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including 
the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this 
information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens 
on industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear 
separately? 
Mandating specific wording and placement for allergen information may raise trade barriers 
and increase costs. 
According to studies by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), presenting too much information together can make it difficult for consumers to 
identify important data.  To avoid this, it is suggested to consider the use of electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display additional allergen information, 
thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
  
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements 
for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already 
applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for 
major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for 
allergen declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional 
costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs 
could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World 
Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the

TO: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, US Treasury Department 
 
RE: Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 238, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov 
 
On behalf of the over 33 million Americans who suﬀer directly from life-threatening food allergies, and 
the more than 85 million that are directly and indirectly aﬀected by food allergies and/or intolerances to 
one of the top 9 food allergens, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) appreciates the opportunity 
to submit the following comments to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the US 
Treasury Department on the TTB’s Proposed Rule, Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
FARE is the nation’s leading non-proﬁt engaged in food allergy advocacy as well as the largest private 
funder of food allergy research. FARE’s innovative education, advocacy, and research initiatives transform 
the future of food allergy through the advancement of new and improved treatments and prevention 
strategies, eﬀective policies and legislation, and novel approaches to managing the disease. Food allergy 
is a disease, not a diet. 
 
FARE estimates that over 75% of Americans with food allergy, over 25 million individuals, are of legal 
drinking age and can be harmed without food allergen labeling of alcoholic beverages, if they choose to 
consume. Our food allergy community needs full disclosure and transparency about food allergens that 
remain in beverage alcohol products—wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages—after manufacture 
and processing. This labeling need also extends to individuals with celiac disease as well. 
 
There has been a long history of discussion related to beverage alcohol labeling with alcohol content, 
nutrition information, major food allergens, and ingredients – in the US and globally. FARE urges that the 
top 9 major food allergens requiring labeling in the US must be disclosed – egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, 
wheat, soy, sesame, ﬁsh, and crustacean shellﬁsh – as well as gluten, on beverage alcohol products 
regulated by TTB. 
 
When the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) was passed, the House 
report noted that consistent with a 1987 Memorandum of Understanding between TTB and the Food & 
Drug Administration (FDA), the House Committee expected that the agencies work together to 
promulgate food allergen labeling regulations with respect to applicable TTB products. 
 
The World Health Organization’s Global Alcohol Action Plan, 2022-2030, notes that “… appropriate 
consumer protection measures through the development and implementation of labelling requirements 
for alcoholic beverages that display essential information for health protection on alcohol content in a 
way that is understood by consumers….” 
 
In recent years, FARE notes that many “hard seltzer” and other similar products produced and sold by 
many beverage alcohol companies with 7% or less alcohol currently follow FDA labeling regulations for 2 
nutrition, ingredients, and food allergens without objection. Additionally, sectors of the beverage alcohol 
industry have been labeling “Contains sulﬁtes” for over 35 years. Thus, FARE urges TTB to work diligently 
and expeditiously to ﬁnalize and implement this proposed rule as quickly as possible. 
 
A ﬁnal introductory note. Our food allergy consumer is highly brand loyal. For foods, data from our FARE 
Food Allergy Consumer Journey research showed that with clear and consistent labeling, food 
manufacturers could unlock over 19 billion dollars per year. A similar scenario could apply to alcoholic 
beverage purchasing. This can be a win-win for those with food allergies and beverage alcohol 
companies by adopting clear food allergen labeling. 
 
Speciﬁc Comments on the Proposed Rule 
 
Allergen disclosure terminology and naming conventions 
 
FARE supports including mandating disclosure and the language of “Contains Major Food Allergen (s)” 
and strongly recommends that TTB consider moving forward on requirements for full ingredient labeling 
to align with FDA food labeling regulations and guidance. 
 
FARE supports TTB’s proposal to require disclosure of the top 9 food allergens, when present in ﬁnished 
alcoholic beverage products as noted in Section V. A. 1. of the proposed rule, using a statement on the 
product label that states, “Contains Major Food Allergen(s): [name of food allergen].” At this time, this 
deviation from FALCPA and FDA guidance is critical as TTB has not issued a proposal for ingredient 
labeling of alcoholic beverages. This statement should follow the same format and type size, and 
placement requirements for sulﬁte labeling on alcoholic beverages. It must be placed either above or 
below sulﬁte labeling disclosure, when applicable. 
 
At present, FARE only can support the above statement to clearly articulate the presence of one or more 
of the top 9 food allergens when present in ﬁnished alcoholic beverage products. However, FARE strongly 
encourages TTB to propose and ﬁnalize labeling requirements for ingredients on alcoholic beverage 
products. Food-allergic consumers are accustomed to looking for allergen information in both the 
ingredient statement and speciﬁcally in the “Contains” statement on FDA-regulated foods and 
beverages. We believe that TTB should make every eﬀort to align with FDA regulations by requiring 
ingredient labeling and disclosure alongside mandatory allergen disclosure. This would facilitate the 
consistent use of the verbiage “Contains: [food allergen]” for disclosure of the major food allergens. FDA 
also permits other allergen information outside of the top nine allergens to be included voluntarily under 
“Other allergen information” separate from the “Contains” statement. TTB could take a similar approach 
to ensure appropriation separation. Once ingredient labeling is established, it would then be appropriate 
for TTB-regulated products to use “Contains: [food allergen],” along with similar plain English naming of 
food allergen ingredients in the full ingredient declaration. 
 
Regarding the question of combining food allergen and existing requirement for disclosure of the 
presence of sulﬁtes as “Contains sulﬁtes.” FARE believes that separation is preferred as both consumers 
with food allergy and those with sulﬁte sensitivity are accustomed to separate information and 
combining could lead to confusion or misreading label information. 
 
Related to naming conventions, FARE urges TTB to adopt the same category and species naming 
conventions used for FDA food allergen labeling within the proposed “Contains…” statement above (e.g., 3 
tree nuts [almond, hazelnut], or ﬁsh [cod]). This has been clear to consumers since the implementation 
of FALCPA requirements since 2004. 
 
Labeling disclosure location and type size requirements 
 
Further, FARE supports the proposed provision of disclosing food allergen information only directly on 
the label of alcoholic beverages. Such information must follow the requirements of FALCPA and FDA’s 
labeling guidance with, at minimum, use of TTB’s proposed “Contains Major Food Allergen(s): [name of 
food allergen]” statement in plain English to alert consumers of the presence of the top 9 food allergens 
requiring labeling. FARE opposes the provision of food allergen information solely oﬀ-label via electronic 
or digital means (e.g., websites, QR codes). This is supported by consumer feedback received on 
development of the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ﬁnal rule on its National Bioengineered Food 
Disclosure (83 Fed Reg 65814). The ﬁnal rule states, “The majority of commenters did not support the 
use of electronic or digital link disclosure in lieu of on-package labeling.” 
 
Food allergen thresholds 
 
The proposed rule in Section V. A.  5. discusses the issue of food allergen thresholds. To date, FDA has not 
yet proposed use of food allergen thresholds on food labeling, exemptions, and enforcement. FARE is 
supportive of the use of food allergen thresholds for the prior reasons and to control and limit the use of 
“May contain” precautionary labeling. In relation to advisory or precaution allergen labeling (PAL), FARE 
appreciates TTB’s recognition of the challenges that come with the use of precautionary or advisory 
allergen (PAL) statements and the recognition that such approaches should not substitute for good 
manufacturing practices. FARE’s comments on this proposal consistently note “when present in ﬁnished 
alcoholic beverage products” [Emphasis added]. FARE believes there are opportunities for TTB to learn 
from the challenges and future being navigated by FDA about employing food allergen thresholds in food 
regulations. Providing clear parameters around the use of PAL, and the potential use of utilizing allergen 
thresholds, oﬀers such an opportunity, and FARE urges TTB to maintain a strong, ongoing dialogue with 
FDA about food allergen thresholds. 
 
The issue of food allergen thresholds has been thoroughly addressed in recent reports from an expert 
consultation led by the Food & Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO/WHO) to inform work of the Codex Alimentarius’s Committee on Food Labeling related to 
priority labeling of food allergens, guidelines for the use of precautionary allergen labeling (PAL) 
statements, and ingredient exemptions. The science is very strong on the applicability of food allergen 
thresholds to not over-label the presence of food allergens and provide clearer information for 
consumers. This may apply to labeling of alcoholic beverages as well. FDA scientists were integral 
members of the FAO/WHO expert consultations, and the agency is exploring the use of food allergen 
thresholds in the US. Food allergen thresholds may be a very useful tool for TTB to employ to determine 
the absence of food allergens in alcoholic beverages, and when the risk of presence of a food allergen 
used as a beverage alcohol processing aid (e.g., ﬁsh ingredients for ﬁning) is determined by risk 
assessment via quantitative data. Until such time that absence of food allergen protein in processing aids 
used in manufacture of alcoholic beverages can be consistently determined, FARE does not oppose TTB’s 
proposed requirement for processing aids to be labeled as, for example, “Contains Major Food Allergen: 
egg (processing aid).’’ 
 
 
 4 
Exemptions 
 
In Section V. B. 1. & 2. of the proposed rule, TTB addresses and requests feedback on exemptions and 
distillation. These issues are complementary and supported by FARE’s discussion of the use of food 
allergen thresholds and our view that labeling is required only when food allergens are present in a 
ﬁnished alcoholic beverage product. FARE supports the use of petitions for exemption when no food 
allergen protein is present along with consultation with FDA. FARE agrees with TTB’s discussion on 
distillation and absence of food allergen protein when manufacturing alcoholic beverages, and supports 
the complementary rational of FDA actions and for TTB to ﬁnalize the distilled spirits regulations in 
proposed 27 CFR 5.75(b)(2) “to speciﬁcally provide that the mandatory labeling requirements do not 
apply to major food allergens used in the production of a distilled spirits product if they have been 
completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.” 
 
Compliance date 
 
Regarding compliance date for this proposed rule, FARE urges TTB to adopt a compliance date of no 
more than 3 years. Our community has needed and wanted this information for over 20 years and 
deserves it as soon as possible. 
 
Comments on Related Proposals on Labeling of Alcoholic Beverages 
 
In addition to this proposed rule on food allergen labeling of alcoholic beverages, TTB issued a proposed 
rule on “Alcohol Facts” provision of nutrition and alcohol content information, and a pre-proposal (since 
withdrawn) on ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages. FARE wholly supports the comments from the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) on the proposed rule for “Alcohol Facts” submitted to this 
docket. FARE urges TTB to publish a proposed rule on ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages for 
public comment as soon as possible. 
 
FARE looks forward to continuing dialogue with TTB and the Treasury Department on all food allergy and 
labeling issues. If you have questions, please contact Robert Earl, Vice President, Regulatory Aﬀairs, at 
rearl@foodallergy.org or 571-771-8582.

Comments of the Beer Institute Regarding NPRM 238 
 
This submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 238, by which the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of specific allergens on 
all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol 
Administration Act (FAA Act). 
 
BI is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer 
importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more 
than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is 
committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal 
responsibility. 
 
BI believes TTB should closely follow FDA regulations in addressing allergen disclosures for TTB-
regulated products. With that background, BI responds in this comment to the questions raised in 
NPRM 238. For any question not expressly addressed, BI currently takes no position. 
 
TTB Request for Comment: TTB solicits comments on the wording of the proposed mandatory 
major food allergen statement and the possible inclusion of other mandatory ingredient 
disclosures. Speciﬁcally, TTB solicits comments on the following:  
 
Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen 
statement (“Contains major 
food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major 
food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or allow alternative formats, including the 
following:  
 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived; or  
 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or other 
language and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is 
derived.  
 
BI Response: TTB should adopt the statement “CONTAINS” followed by a colon and the 
name of the allergen as the simplest and already recognized manner of disclosing 
allergens.    
2 
 
 
TTB Request for Comment :  
1. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement?  
2. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion of major 
food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major food allergen 
statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB use the 
“Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with FDA’s approach? Should TTB 
limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major food allergens?  
 
3. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB regulations 
(FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulﬁtes, and aspartame) be required to 
be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other ingredients be included in a  
“Contains” statement that includes the major food allergens? (For example,  “Contains egg 
and sulﬁtes”). Or should the major food allergens be identiﬁed as such, and the other 
ingredients listed separately (for example,  “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg. Contains 
sulﬁtes”)? Should another statement be used for i ngredients that are required to be 
disclosed under current TTB regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, 
sulﬁtes, and aspartame) to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food 
allergens? 
 
BI Response to TTB Requests 1-3 above: TTB should align with FDA rules on mandatory 
allergen disclosures. For example, TTB should provide flexibility for producers to use either 
a) a list of ingredients (voluntarily disclosed) or b) a “CONTAINS” statement. And if a 
voluntary ingredient statement lists an allergen, there should be no additional disclosure 
requirement. TTB should not allow flexibility in listing other ingredients that a producer 
must disclose under current TTB regulations, such as major food allergens. 
(For example, 
“Contains egg and sulﬁtes”). The major allergen declaration should be separate from other 
ingredient claims. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the 
label, including the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to ﬁnd 
this information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens on 
industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear separately?  
 
BI Response: Provided all mandatory disclosures are conspicuous, producers should have 
the flexibility to separate required disclosures. Major allergen declarations should be 
separated from other compulsory disclosures. 
  
3 
 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Should TTB mandate speciﬁc placement, type size, and 
presentation requirements for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements 
already applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for major 
allergen labeling?  
 
BI Response: TTB should align its requirements with FDA’s allergen disclosure 
requirements. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB solicits comments on whether labeling alcohol beverages 
produced using ﬁnﬁsh protein merely as containing “ﬁsh,” rather than with the name of the ﬁsh 
species, provides adequate information to consumers. TTB also seeks comments on whether 
there are alternative approaches to this issue that would provide consumers with adequate 
information regarding the use of ﬁnﬁsh protein in the production of alcohol beverages.  
 
BI Response: We support using “fish” rather than the species' name. However, consistent with 
FDA guidance, TTB should not require an allergen disclosure if finfish protein used in alcohol 
beverage production does not appear  in the finished product or cannot cause an allergic 
reaction. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is proposing to require the disclosure of ﬁning or processing 
agents that are or contain major food allergens, with the option of including the added 
parenthetical “(processing aid)” and is soliciting comments on this proposal. For example, if egg 
whites are used as a processing aid for wine, the industry member has the  option of disclosing 
this on the label as follows: “Contains Major Food Allergen: egg (processing aid).” This is an option 
that industry members may choose to use, but they also may choose to list these agents without 
parentheticals. TTB is not proposing parenthetical statements for other incidental additives 
besides processing aids. TTB seeks comments on whether this proposal, which is generally 
consistent with FALCPA, will provide adequate information to consumers.  
 
 
BI Response: TTB should not require disclosure of fining or processing agents that do not 
appear in the finished product or that  cannot cause an allergic reaction.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB’s proposal does not speciﬁcally address allergen advisory labeling, 
such as statements that a product may contain a major food allergen, e.g., “May Contain (major 
food allergen).” TTB is concerned that allergen advisory labeling could be used as a substitute for 
adherence to current good manufacturing practices and could be misleading. TTB is soliciting 
comments on the use of allergen advisory la
beling.   
4 
 
 
 
BI Response: TTB should align its requirements with FDA’s allergen disclosure requirements. 
  
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is proposing in 27 CFR 5.75(b)(2) that major food allergens, or 
ingredients containing major food allergens, need not be declared on a label when such allergens 
or ingredients have been subject to distillation in such a manner that no protein, allergenic or 
otherwise, remains in the distilled product or distilled ingredient. As explained below, this is 
consistent with the position FDA has taken regarding the removal of proteins using the distillation 
process within the context of major food allergen labeling and gluten- free labeling of distilled 
foods. TTB is soliciting comments on this proposal.  
 
BI Response: Consistent with FDA guidance, TTB should not mandate allergen disclosures for 
ingredients that do not appear in the finished product or that can no longer cause an allergic 
reaction. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB solicits comments on whether the proposed compliance date 
would suffice to limit the impact on small businesses and to reduce overall costs of compliance 
while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed. TTB also seeks comments on whether 
the use of a single compliance date for any new regulations on allergen, ingredient, or “Alcohol 
Facts” labeling would provide consumers with adequate information in a coherent and timely 
manner while also reducing costs and other regulatory burdens on industry.  
 
BI Response: TTB should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 
238. This will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB is seeking comments on whether the compliance date for this 
proposed rule should be coordinated with the compliance dates of other labeling changes that 
have been proposed by TTB, including Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of 
Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, which proposed the inclusion of Alcohol Facts 
statements on alcohol beverage labels, as well as any proposals that may be aired as a result of 
the ANPRM on ingredient labeling. See  Notice No. 237. Promulgating the requirements for the 
ﬁnal label changes together would allow bottlers and importers to undertake all the label 
revisions necessary to implement these changes in one label change. For example,  it is TTB’s 
preliminary conclusion that for industry members that would be required to  make label changes 
under any new requirements resulting from the Alcohol Facts and the Allergen rulemakings, it 
would be more efficient and less costly to make changes to the label to accommodate both 
requirements at the same time. If the rules were instead promulgated and took effect at different 
points in time, TTB assumes th at the multiple distinct label changes would result in  greater costs.  
5 
 
 
TTB invites comments on this preliminary conclusion.  
 
BI Response: TTB should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 
238. This will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : Are there alternative ways of providing a major food allergen disclosure, 
for example, by allowing information to be provided through a website using a quick response code 
(QR code) or website address on the label? Will such an alternative method still provide adequate 
information to the consumer?  
 
BI Response: QR codes should only be an option for voluntarily disclosed information. QR 
codes or website addresses are not the best way to disclose mandatory allergen 
information to consumers. 
 
TTB Request for Comment : Does the proposed compliance date suffice to reduce overall costs 
of compliance, and speciﬁcally the costs to small businesses, while ensuring that consumers are 
protected?  
 
BI Response: Unless the rule changes are extensive and require more time for full 
compliance, five years should be sufficient for a full compliance date. As noted, TTB should 
align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 238. This will aid 
producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will require multiple 
label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
  
TTB Request for Comment : Is there a shorter compliance period that would provide more beneﬁts to 
consumers while still limiting costs and potential impacts on small businesses? Speciﬁcally, 
would a 2-, 3- or 3.5-year compliance period suffice?  
 
BI Response: Unless the rule changes are extensive and require more time for full 
compliance, five years should be sufficient for a full compliance date. As noted, TTB 
should align compliance dates for any rulemaking resulting from NPRM 237 and 238. This 
will aid producers in developing a single label redesign, as multiple compliance dates will 
require multiple label redesigns and unnecessary costs.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : If a ﬁnal rule is issued, will industry members begin implementation 
of the labeling changes in advance of the compliance date?  
 
BI Response: Many industry members will begin phasing in compliant labels earlier than the 
compliance date as brands undergo label changes in the normal course of business. However, new  
6 
 
 
label lead times, even for existing products (not including new-to-market products), may take 6 
months or more. Industry members must update hundreds of distinct brands, labels, and package 
types. The rule changes proposed here and in NPRM 237 are significant regarding time 
requirements and cost.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : How might consumers beneﬁt from early compliance by industry? Are 
there any ongoing costs of compliance with the proposed rule that TTB has not addressed in this 
document?  
 
BI Response: Most compliance costs will be associated with the initial label changeover. Ongoing 
expenses might include additional analysis and ingredient evaluation, formula creation, and product 
testing.  
 
TTB Request for Comment : TTB believes that a labeling statement with information about the 
presence of major food allergens in the production of an alcohol beverage will provide signiﬁcant 
beneﬁts. Consumers with these food allergies will be able to make an informed decision as to 
whether consumption of a particular alcohol beverage may pose  a risk of an allergic reaction. This 
proposal will also promote consistency in major food allergen disclosure across all types of food 
product labels, removing ambiguity about whether a product contains a major food allergen or 
not. TTB invites comments on its conclusion that consumers would beneﬁt from having this 
information available on product labels. 
 
 
BI Response: BI believes consumers would benefit from information on labels about major 
food allergens present in finished alcohol beverages, which  can cause an allergic reaction . 
 
Conclusion 
 
BI strongly encourages TTB to align with the FDA on reasonable allergen disclosures. Again, BI currently 
takes no position on any question not expressly addressed in this comment. Additionally, BI reserves 
the right to amend these responses or to comment further as appropriate.

Dear Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Eilers:   
  
The National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) greatly appreciates the opportunity to 
provide comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on Major Food Allergen 
Labeling.1  For the reasons stated below, NABI believes that the Major Food Allergen should 
remain voluntary.  First, the regulatory environment today poses a higher bar for agencies in 
issuing regulations because of various executive orders.  Second, there remains a core question 
on the structure of the proposed regulations: should the threshold for label disclosure be whether 
the major food allergen was “used in” in the production of the wine, spirits, or beer or whether 
the major food allergen is present in the final product.  The proposed regulations adopt the “used 
in” standard whereas NABI argues that the “presence” standard would provide the consumer 
with more accurate information and is what the vast majority of consumer rely on. 
 
 
Regulatory Environment 
 
Notice 238 cites the Treasury Report on Competition as an impetus for revisiting this proposal.  
On February 9, 2022, the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, released a report entitled “Competition in the 
Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits” (Competition Report). The Competition Report was 
 
1 Prior to the publication of these notices, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) held two virtual 
“Listening Sessions” on these topics in February 2024, and NABI presented a statement and submitted a written  
comment at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/TTB-2024-0002-0416

required by Executive Order 14036,2 “Promoting Competition in the American Economy”. One 
of the Competition Report's findings directed agencies to review “[r]egulatory proposals that 
could serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers, such as 
mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been implemented.”  
The Competition Report contained several recommendations, including that “TTB should revive 
or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory information on alcohol 
content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”  Consistent with the Competition 
Report's recommendations, TTB revisited the issue of mandatory allergen labeling for alcohol 
beverages.  However, by Executive Order, dated August 13, 20253 the President revoked 
Executive Order 14036.   
 
Notice 238 was published before the current Administration took office.  The current 
Administration has issued several executive orders on the promulgation of new regulations and 
review of existing regulations to ensure “regulations [are] squarely authorized by constitutional 
Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome 
administrative state.”4   Any new regulations, especially mandatory ones, will be held to a higher 
scrutiny. A voluntary standard as opposed to a mandatory requirement is more likely to clear a 
review under the executive orders because it is less burdensome.  It is maintaining an option for 
the industry and not imposing a new requirement on it.    
 
Accordingly, NABI’s comments recognize the regulatory climate of the current Administration 
that was not present in February 2024, at the time of the listening sessions.       
 
Consistent with the above, NABI respectfully recommends that the major food allergens label 
disclosure continue as a voluntary label provision in the regulations and not a mandatory one and 
should be assessable through a Quick Response (QR) code.

Major Food Allergen Labeling (Notice No. 238) 
 
Under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 USC Chapter 8, TTB is responsible 
for ensuring that the consumer has “adequate information as to identify and quality” of the wine, 
distilled spirits, or malt beverages from the label.  27 USC 205(e)(2).  Enacted in 2004, the Food 
Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) required food labels to declare the 
presence of each major food allergen using the name of the food source from which the major 
food allergen is derived.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administers FALCPA.  
However, the report of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce 
recognized that TTB has primary jurisdiction under the FAA Act for the labeling of wines, 
distilled spirits, and malt beverages.  The Committee directed TTB to work with FDA on 
developing its own regulations on major food allergens for beverage alcohol products under the 
FAA Act.5   
 
Initially in 2006, TTB promulgated a voluntary interim rule on the disclosure of the major food 
allergens and published a notice of proposed rulemaking to make the major food allergen label 
requirement mandatory.  TTB did not finalized the mandatory proposal; rather, the interim 
regulations remain in effect. The regulations in Notice No. 238, now propose to make the major 
food allergen labeling mandatory.   
 
Voluntary Disclosure of Major Food Allergens 
 
NABI urges TTB to maintain the voluntary nature of the major food allergen disclosure because 
of the testing costs that would be necessary for imported products.  This cost could arise with 
every import shipment of wine, spirits, or beer in order to confirm or guarantee that no major 
food allergen is present in the imported product.  The Supplementary Information states “TTB 
notes that this proposal does not require additional analytical testing, as it generally requires 
labeling of major food allergens used as an ingredient, and ingredients are expected to be known 
by the producer.”6   In the majority of these shipments, the importer is not the producer or may 
be purchasing the products from an exporter in the other country who also is not the producer.  
Shipment-by-shipment testing is the only way for the importer to confirm the absence of a major 
food allergen.  The five-year implementation period does not address or mitigate this concern.  
 
Moreover, the pivotal question is determining the standard that triggers the label disclosure of 
this information to the consumer.  In order not to mislead the consumer, the disclosure, if any, 
must be scientifically accurate regarding the end product for consumers.  The proposed 
regulations adopt a threshold of whether the major food allergen was “used in” the production of 
the wine, spirits, or beer is not as accurate for the consumer as is whether it is “present” in the 
final product.  For example, under the “used in” production standard “Fish” would have to be 
disclosed in all cases whereas under the “presence” standard this would have to be disclosed 
only where the fish protein remains in the final wine or beer.  For this reason, NABI supports the 
“presence” standard.    
 
 
5 H.R. Rep. No. 608, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., at 3 (2004).   
6 90 Federal Register 5774 (January 17, 2025). 4 
 
This distinction is important for importers.  Importers of bottled, canned, or other consumer 
ready containers would need to obtain the allergen content information from the exporter who 
may or may not be the producer of the product.  The proposed rule explains that no additional 
testing needs to be untaken because the producer is generally assumed to know whether major 
allergens were “used” in the production process.  For some imported products, this information 
may be difficult to obtain from the foreign producer or exporter so additional testing would be 
required.  The “presence” standard would facilitate this additional testing more than would the 
“used in” standard.   
 
Finally, one of the questions for comment is whether the caption on the label should be 
“Contains:” or “Contains Major Food Allergens:”.  The use of the “presence” standard is more 
consistent with the term “Contains.”   
 
Disclosure of Other Additives 
 
Adoption of the proposed regulations would result in two categories of public health information 
on additives, fermenting material, and fining agents in the regulations.  Current TTB regulations7 
require the disclosure of FD&C Yellow #5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame 
(in the case of distilled spirits and malt beverages8). These are not major food allergens.  The 
major food allergens are the second category and are Milk, Egg, Fish (for example, bass, 
flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (for example crab, lobster, or shrimp, tree nuts (for 
example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.  
 
Accordingly, NABI believes that these two elements of information may appear adjacent on the 
label as long as the consumer readily understands that the additives are not major food allergens.      
 
Major Food Allergens – FDA and TTB Regulations 
 
In preparing the proposed regulations, TTB has relied heavily on and deferred to the FDA 
regulatory framework on major food allergens while also noting in the NPRM where it proposes 
a variation.  The Supplementary Information explains “it is TTB's responsibility to implement 
allergen labeling regulations that are appropriate for alcohol beverages, as noted in the FALCPA 
House committee report.”9 
 
For example, fish is a major food allergen and the species of fish is required to be disclosed 
under the FALCPA.  Wineries and brewers use isinglass and fish gelatin as a fining agent but are 
generally unable to obtain the species of the fish used. TTB’s proposal will allow the disclosure 
term of “Fish” in this circumstance and not the species.  NABI fully concurs with this approach 
because it lessens the burden on the industry member and still protects the consumer who is

Quick Response (QR) Codes   
 
NABI supports the use of a QR code to convey major food allergen details to consumers.  The 
quality and quantity of additional information that may be given to a consumer via the QR code 
is enormous and, moreover, the QR code allows this additional information to be updated 
constantly at a cost to the industry that is far less than a paper label.   
 
Additionally, the QR code gives the industry member the opportunity to include some 
explanation about the major food allergen that would not otherwise be available on the limited 
""real estate"" of labels on the bottle or consumer container.  Moreover, broad generational 
acceptance of e-devices and I-phones necessitate their use today. Consumers today look for the 
QR code on a label as an information resource.

Re: Comments on TTB  Notice No. 238, Docket No. TTB -2024-0003: Major 
Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
Dear Director Greenberg: 
 
I write as President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirts Alliance (“ADSA”) to provide 
the collective comments of ADSA members to TTB’s Notice No. 238 entitled Major Food 
Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (the “Notice”).1  ADSA 
is a trade association of twenty member companies with common interests in the 
manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the United States.  
ADSA members produce over sixty percent of all the distilled spirits sold in the U.S.  
Previously known as the Presidents’ Forum of the Distilled Spirits Industry, ADSA traces 
its history back over 40 years.   
 
As in 2024, we support transparent labeling that protects consumers while avoiding 
unnecessary confusion or costs. We believe the proposed allergen labeling requirements 
should be carefully scoped, science -based, and technologically modern. Below, ADSA 
provides its comments on each key area raised in this rulemaking. 
 
Support for Allergen Disclosure Based on Finished Product Composition 
 
ADSA supports mandatory disclosure of allergens only where the allergenic substance is 
present in the finished product and poses a realistic risk to consumers. Many distilled 
spirits begin with raw materials such as grains or nuts that are entirely transformed during 
distillation. In such cases, no allergenic protein remains. Requiring these inputs to be 
listed would mislead consumers by implying a risk that does not exist. 
 
This approach aligns with long -standing U.S. Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer 
Protection Act principles and international standards. For example, EU regulations do not 
require listing allergens that have been fully transformed in production or when the 
product name clearly identifies an allergenic ingredient (such as hazelnut liqueur). The 
U.S. should avoid unnecessary, misleading, or redundant allergen disclosures that 
provide no additional safety benefit. 
 
1 90 FR 5763 (Jan. 17, 2025).   
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 2 of 4 
 
We support TTB’s proposal that the mandatory food allergen statement consist of the 
words “Contains Major Food Allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food 
source(s) from which each major food allergen is derived. For example: “Contains Major 
Food Allergen: milk” or “Contains Major Food Allergens: wheat and milk.” TTB should also 
allow inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient statement (or a 
mandatory ingredient statement, should such a requirement be adopted) rather than  
mandating a separate allergen statement. 
Further, the presence of a major food allergen statement should not affect the location of 
other mandatory ingredient disclosures, including FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract 
or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame. We also recommend that TTB not mandate specific 
placement, type size, or presentation requirements for major allergen labeling statements. 
It is possible to provide full transparency to consumers while preserving flexibili ty for 
suppliers in how allergen information is presented. 
We appreciate TTB’s intention to clarify that mandatory labeling requirements do not 
apply to major food allergens used in the production of a distilled spirits product if they 
have been completely distilled in such a manner that no protein remains in the final 
product. We further support TTB’s plan to evaluate compliance through scientifically valid 
analytical methods capable of reliably detecting the presence or absence of protein or 
protein fragments in the finished product. We encourage TTB to broaden t his approach 
by stipulating that, for flavors or other ingredients included in a distilled spirits product, 
proteins from major allergens that have been removed by methods other than distillation 
should likewise not require disclosure. Once the protein has been removed, the allergen 
is no longer present and should not be treated as such for labeling purposes. 
Recommended Label Declaration Format and Placement 
 
Where allergens are truly present in the final product, ADSA recommends a clear and 
concise statement, such as ""Contains milk,"" displayed near required product information. 
We do not support long -form ingredient lists, which are both scientifically inaccur ate for 
distilled products and unnecessarily complicated for consumers. 
 
TTB should also explicitly allow allergen information to be provided digitally through QR 
codes or a designated website. This would enable producers to maintain concise on-label 
information while making detailed allergen statements readily available online . Digital 
disclosures are increasingly familiar to consumers and avoid the label clutter that can 
make key safety information harder to read. 
 
The food and beverage industry has already established a proven model for this type of 
disclosure through SmartLabel. SmartLabel allows participating brands to present both 
mandatory and voluntary label information —including allergens—in a consistent, easy -
to-navigate format. More than 80 parent companies, representing over 1,000 brands and 
100,000 products across consumer-packaged goods categories, use SmartLabel to 
share detailed product data, much of which could not fit on traditional packaging. 
  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 3 of 4 
 
A key advantage of SmartLabel is its flexibility and timeliness. Brand owners control the 
content and can update it instantly, ensuring that allergen information is accurate and 
reflects any product reformulations. This eliminates the lag time and costs associated with 
reprinting labels, while maintaining compliance and consumer safety. 
 
Consumers value and trust this type of disclosure. A 2021 national survey conducted by 
the Consumer Brands Association and the Food Marketing Institute found that consumers 
viewed SmartLabel’s product information as very clear, easy to navigate, and easy t o 
read. This positive reception shows that a digital format can successfully communicate 
important safety data while remaining user-friendly. 
 
TTB can follow this tested path by allowing QR code or web -based disclosures for 
allergens. Doing so would align alcohol beverage labeling with best practices in other 
regulated sectors, increase the accuracy and accessibility of allergen information, and 
help ensure that consumers have the tools they need to make safe, informed choices 
without sacrificing on-label clarity. 
 
Costs to Producers and Practical Alternatives 
 
Mandatory static allergen statements on every label would create significant costs. 
Producers would need to redesign labels, reapply for approvals, and potentially retest 
formulations. Each of these steps carries expenses that are particularly difficult fo r small 
producers to absorb, potentially reducing innovation and limiting consumer choice. 
 
Allowing QR codes as a recognized form of disclosure dramatically lowers these costs. It 
permits updates without redesigning labels or resubmitting for approval, accommodates 
seasonal or batch -specific products, and allows producers to tailor information f or 
different export markets while maintaining accuracy and compliance. 
 
Impact on Small and New Businesses 
 
Small and emerging businesses often lack the internal infrastructure that larger 
companies have to manage frequent label changes or absorb the high costs of allergen 
testing. Imposing static allergen labeling requirements without flexibility would 
disproportionately burden these companies and could deter new market entrants. We 
appreciate TTB’s careful consideration of stakeholder comments on mandatory ingredient 
labeling for distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages, and applaud its decision to 
withdraw the rulemaking on this topic. 
 
To address these challenges going forward, ADSA urges TTB to take a digital -first 
approach. Allowing QR codes would enable small producers to meet disclosure 
requirements without incurring excessive design, printing, or regulatory costs. Coupled 
with this approach, we strongly recommend a phased implementation period of at least 
five years and a single effective date for all labeling changes. Avoiding piecemeal 
rulemaking will prevent multiple rounds of costly modifications, giving businesses the 
ability to plan and budget effectively. Aligning this five -year compliance period with the  
 
TTB-2025-0002 
Page 4 of 4 
 
new “Alcohol Facts” requirement  and confirming that new COLA applications are not 
needed when the only change is the inclusion of a major food allergen statement  will 
further ease the transition for industry members. 
 
Need for Ongoing Collaboration with TTB 
 
ADSA strongly supports continued collaboration between TTB, public health experts, 
consumer representatives, and industry stakeholders before finalizing any new rule. We 
recommend forming a technical working group to evaluate allergen risk, test QR code 
solutions, and develop uniform guidance on definitions, testing thresholds, and best 
practices. 
 
This cooperative process will ensure rules are science-based, feasible to implement, and 
provide meaningful information to consumers. We also encourage TTB to coordinate 
future rulemakings to avoid staggered or piecemeal changes that would compound costs 
and confusion. 
 
Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Modern, Flexible Labeling Standards 
 
The U.S. has an opportunity to lead in modernizing alcohol labeling through flexible, 
digital-forward solutions. The EU’s approach to allergen labeling has added significant 
on-pack complexity without proven benefit to consumers, often requiring labels to list 
ingredients that have no presence in the final product. U.S. policy should avoid this path 
by focusing on material risks and embracing technological tools like QR codes to give 
consumers more, not less, clarity. 
 
*     *     * 
 
ADSA appreciates the opportunity to provide input on Notice No. 238. We support clear 
allergen disclosures based on finished product composition and recommend digital 
disclosure methods to improve accuracy, lower costs, and avoid cluttering labels. We 
believe a hybrid approach that combines concise on-label statements with QR code 
access to more detailed information best serves consumers, promotes innovation, and 
keeps regulatory burdens reasonable. 
 
We look forward to continuing to work with TTB to ensure any final rule is science-based, 
practical to implement, and responsive to consumer needs.

Subject: Comments on: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt 
Beverages 
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
I write to you today on behalf of the Mezcal Sustainability Alliance, a strategic collaboration 
among companies and with  institutions in the sector, committed to the sustainable 
development of Mezcal. Its purpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by 
disseminating good practices, promoting joint projects and generating a positive impact on 
producing communities. With a focus on innovative  solutions, the Alliance seeks to 
accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that defines Mezcal.  
 
The Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB for notifying its proposed regulation to the 
TBT Committee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade 
Organization, in accordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that 
notifications of technical regulations sh ould occur at a stage where comments can be 
considered and modifications to the initial proposal can be made. 
 
Background 
 
On January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. 
published the proposal  ""Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled 
Spirits, and Malt Beverages "", which seeks to implement mandatory labeling of major food 
allergens in alcoholic beverages.  The TTB has proposed a five -year compliance period, 
starting from the date the final standard is published in the Federal Register. 
Under the current interim standard (T.D. TTB-53), major allergens in alcoholic beverages like 
wine and spirits may be voluntarily declared using the phrase “Contains: [allergen]”. 
However, the TTB now proposes making allergen labeling mandatory, with an exemption for 
distilled products whe re the distillation process fully removes all proteins, including 
allergens. It should be noted that the TTB proposes an exemption for allergen declaration in  
distilled alcoholic beverages, provided that an allergen or ingredient containing it undergoes 
a distillation process that completely removes any protein, allergenic or not, in the distilled 
product or ingredient. 
Furthermore, the TTB proposal requires that alcoholic beverage labels include a legend with 
the phrase ""Contains Major Food Allergen(s)"", followed by the specific allergens, as in the 
example ""Contains Major Food Allergen: milk"". 
In Mexico, NOM -142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 stipulates that food allergens must be listed in the 
ingredient declaration only when they are present in the final product, and this requirement 
applies exclusively to liqueurs, creams, cocktails, and prepared alcoholic b everages. No 
specific allergen warning is mandated. 
 
Key Questions from the TTB: 
1. Should TTB adopt the proposed wording of the major food allergen statement 
(“Contains major food allergen(s)” followed by a colon and the name of the food source 
from which each major food allergen is derived)? Alternately, should TTB require or 
allow alternative formats, including the following: 
• “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which 
each major food allergen is derived; or 
• A heading such as “Major Food Allergen Information” followed by “Contains:” or 
other language and the name of the food source from which each major food 
allergen is derived. 
While we understand the importance of informing about allergens on labels, we believe that 
adding an additional legend or declaration to the ingredient list does not provide any real 
benefit to the consumer. On the contrary, this would increase costs for m anufacturers, 
importers, and distributors. This practice could be considered a technical barrier to trade, 
which would go against Article 2.2 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on 
Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade barriers.  
Moreover, the CODEX Alimentarius, in its revision of the General Standard for the Labeling 
of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 1 -1985), recommends that allergen declaration be preferably 
done within the ingredient list. In cases where a separate declaration is required, it sho uld 
be limited to the term ""Contains"" (or its equivalent) followed by the name of the allergen and, 
when applicable, should be located directly below or near the ingredient list.   
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends that 
information on alcoholic beverage labels be clear, concise, and relevant to be effective, and 
that excessive information can confuse the consumer. 
The interim rule T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260) allows producers of wines and distilled spirits to 
voluntarily declare major allergens on their product labels. This declaration must include 
the word ""Contains"", followed by a colon and the name of the allergenic ingredient, such as 
""Contains: egg"". It is proposed that the TTB consider s the possibility of declaring major 
allergens as part of the ingredient list, which is only mandatory for prepared alcoholic 
beverages, liqueurs or creams that contain ingredients t hat cause hypersensitivity and are 
present in the final product. Another option is to simply use the word ""Contains"" followed by 
the allergen, without the need for a longer phrase. This would be easy for the consumer to 
understand and would be in line with  the current regulation for voluntary allergen 
declaration in alcoholic beverages. 
However, i f it is decided to move forward with this proposal that would modify alcoholic 
beverage labelling, it is essential to allow the use of technological tools on the label to 
provide additional information. This can be achieved through electronic labelling, using a 
QR code, a digital medium, or a website. This tool offers the advantage of providing unlimited 
space for consumer information, presenting it in a friendly and easy -to-understand format. 
In addition, it allows for easy adaptation to changes in regulatory provisions, and facilitates 
information reaching young people, a vulnerable group, to prevent harmful alcohol 
consumption. It also allows for the development of educational and interactive content for 
the consumer. Thus, consumers would be ef fectively informed without overloading 
alcoholic beverage labels with excessive information. 
 
2. Should TTB allow the inclusion of major food allergens within a voluntary ingredient 
statement on labels as an alternative to a separate major food allergen statement? 
Voluntary allergen declaration is not recommended due to the health risk to consumers. To 
clearly and accurately inform about major allergens, it is proposed to include them in the 
product's ingredient list or to use the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen's name. It 
is also proposed to consider the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digital media, or 
websites) to display this information and avoid saturating the physical label.  
3. If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopted, should TTB allow the inclusion 
of major food allergens in the list of ingredients as an alternative to a separate major 
food allergen statement? If mandatory ingredient labeling is ultimately adopt ed, 
should TTB use the “Contains” statement for major food allergens, consistent with  
FDA's approach? Should TTB limit the use of the “Contains” statement only for major 
food allergens? 
It is recommended that the declaration of major allergens be integrated into the ingredient 
list, including the proteins they contain, instead of creating a separate section. It is also 
suggested to evaluate the use of electronic labeling (QR codes, digita l platforms, or 
websites) to display detailed allergen information, thus avoiding overloading the physical 
product label. 
4. Should other ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
be required to be listed in one statement on the label? If so, should the other 
ingredients be included in a “Contains” statement that includes the major food 
allergens? (For example, “Contains egg and sulfites”). Or should the major food 
allergens be identified as such, and the other ingredients listed separately (for 
example, “Contains Major  Food Allergen: egg. Contains sulfites”)? Should another 
statement be used for ingredients that are required to be disclosed under current TTB 
regulations (FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame) 
to differentiate from the “Contains” statement for major food allergens? 
It is considered that mentioning the ingredients in the list is sufficient to inform consumers, 
as they can easily identify them on the label. Alternatively, it is proposed to use electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital media, or websites) to display allergen information, thus avoiding 
overloading the physical product label. 
5. Would requiring all mandatory disclosures to be in one place on the label, including 
the proposed major food allergen statement, make it easier for consumers to find this 
information? Would such a requirement impose additional costs or regulatory burdens 
on industry members as compared to allowing the mandatory disclosures to appear 
separately? 
Mandating specific wording and placement for allergen information may raise trade barriers 
and increase costs. 
According to studies by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), presenting too much information together can make it difficult for consumers to 
identify important data.  To avoid this, it is suggested to consider the use of electronic 
labeling (QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to display additional allergen information, 
thus avoiding overloading the physical label. 
  
6. Should TTB mandate specific placement, type size, and presentation requirements 
for major allergen labeling statements in addition to the requirements already 
applicable to all mandatory information on alcohol beverage labels? For example, 
should the required allergen disclosure statement be set off by a box? Or, to the extent 
practicable, should TTB mandate formatting consistent with FDA requirements for 
major allergen labeling? 
It is not advisable to establish specific location, size, and presentation requirements for 
allergen declarations, as this offers no benefits to the consumer and generates additional 
costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This imposition of additional costs 
could be considered a technical barrier to trade, which contravenes Article 2.2 of the World 
Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which seeks to avoid the 
creation of unnecessary trade barriers. This agreement est ablishes that technical 
regulations should not be implemented that hinder international trade without valid 
justification in the legitimate objectives of member states.  
In the recent revision of the General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 
1-1985): Provisions for Allergen Labeling of the CODEX Alimentarius, it has been established 
that the presentation of allergens should preferably be done through the ingredient list. 
Should a separate declaration be necessary, it should begin with the term ""Contains 
________"" (or an equivalent term) and be placed directly below or very near the ingredient 
list, when present. This provision avoids the use of a more exte nsive legend, which could 
confuse the consumer. 
 
 
   
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Based on the arguments presented, it is suggested that allergen information in alcoholic 
beverages be presented clearly and concisely to the consumer, avoiding additional costs 
and barriers to international trade. Likewise, it is proposed that the declarat ion of major 
allergens in alcoholic beverages be limited to their inclusion in the ingredient list. Should an 
additional declaration be required, it is suggested that it be concise, as proposed by the 
CODEX Alimentarius and the Voluntary Major Allergen Declaration Standard (T.D. TTB-53 (71 
FR 42260), using only the legend ""Contains"" followed by the allergen, without the need for a 
more extensive text. It is essential that the possibility of using electronic labeling (through 
QR codes, digital platforms, or websites) to provide additional information or legends about 
major allergens be considered. This method facilitates access to relevant information for 
the consumer and avoids the imposition of unnecessary regulatory and commercial 
burdens.

Re: Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notices No. 237 and 238 – Alcohol 
Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and 
Malt Beverages; and Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
Dear Director, 
 
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide comments to The 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regarding  Docket No. TTB -2025-0002; Notice 
No. 238 on Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
The SWA is the Scotch Whisky industry ’s trade association . We have over 90 member 
companies, from multinational spirits producers through to small family -run distillers, bottlers, 
blenders, and brand owners. Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky 
industry by production.  
 
Any rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the 
Scotch Whisky’s biggest market by value, with exports worth £971 million in 2024. In addition, 
many of our larger members are also investors in the United States. 
 
The SWA appreciates TTB’s approach regarding allergens labelling for distilled spirits. As stated 
in the Notice, the production of spirits involves the distillation of raw materials in such a way that 
no protein, allergenic or otherwise, remains in the distilled product or distilled ingredient. It is 
therefore appropriate that the mandatory labelling requirements do not apply to major food 
allergens used before the distillation process.  Due to the same reasoning, the SWA does not 
recommend the adoption of allergen advisory labelling for distilled spirits . Proper distillation 
practices ensures that no protein is contained in the distilled product or distilled ingredient . 
Furthermore, allergen advisory labelling such as “May contain: [ ]” has the potential to create 
more confusion for consumers and does not provide clear actionable messaging regarding the 
presence of a major food allergen in the final product. 
 
We also support the method of verifying compliance when ingredients containing protein are 
added to the distilled spirits product after distillation, and no major food allergens are listed on 
the label.  
 
SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice 238 
 
2 
 
For those products where the presence of allergens would have to be disclosed, the SWA 
welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. In addition, we would like to request the 
possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on t he market before the 
proposed rule comes into effect. 
 
We would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts 
Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its 
implementation is aligned with that of Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, along with any other ingredient labeling proposal TTB might 
be considering. 
 
 
Yours sincerely,

Comment on Major Food Allergen Labeling  Docket No. TTB-2025-0003, Notice No. 238, RIN 1513-AC94  I support the proposed rule requiring labeling disclosure of all major food allergens used in the production of alcoholic beverages, but I would like to emphasize the critical need for a requirement specifying a minimum font size for allergen notifications on labels. Many individuals, including those with visual impairments, older consumers, and those with limited literacy skills, struggle to read small print on product labels. Clear and legible allergen notifications are essential for ensuring that all consumers can easily identify potential allergens and make informed decisions about the products they consume. For individuals with food allergies, the ability to quickly and accurately read allergen information can be a matter of life and death. Ingesting an allergen due to unreadable labeling can lead to severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Therefore, it is imperative that allergen notifications be presented in a font size that is easily readable by all consumers. To respond to a specific question posed by the TTB regarding the format of allergen notifications, I propose that the phrase “Contains:” followed by the potential allergen(s) is sufficient to convey the needed information. This succinct approach avoids unnecessary elaboration or wordiness, ensuring the label remains clear and easy to understand. There is no need to prominently state ""Major Food Allergen"" or similar terms on the label. Consumers concerned about particular allergens only need to see the specific allergen identified, and this will adequately serve the cautionary purpose. To enhance the readability of allergen notifications, I recommend that the TTB establish a minimum font size of at least 10 points for allergen declarations. (This is equivalent to a size of approximately 3.53 millimeters.) This recommendation aligns with best practices in labeling and ensures that the critical information is accessible to a broad audience. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have established minimum font size requirements for  2 
important label information to ensure readability. Adopting a similar approach for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels would be consistent with these established practices and promote consumer safety. Studies have shown that larger font sizes significantly improve readability and comprehension of label information. According to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), increasing font size on medication labels improved patient understanding and compliance. Additionally, organizations advocating for individuals with food allergies and visual impairments have consistently highlighted the importance of readable labeling. Groups including the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) and the American Council of the Blind (ACB) have called for larger font sizes to ensure that critical health information is accessible to all consumers. Establishing a minimum font size for allergen notifications on alcoholic beverage labels is a necessary and logical step to enhance consumer safety and accessibility. I strongly urge the TTB to incorporate this requirement into the final rule to ensure that all consumers, regardless of visual ability, can easily access and understand allergen information.   Thank you for considering this important issue.

More than 33 million Americans currently have food allergies, and this number is only projected to increase, meaning the people who would be helped by this passing would only increase. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in passing this regulation.<br/>",0,-1,"[-1, -1, -1]",-1,-1,-1,gratitude,0.8649840354919434,"{'admiration': 0.0008524376316927373, 'amusement': 0.00015864247689023614, 'anger': 0.0001407450035912916, 'annoyance': 0.00032820753403939307, 'approval': 0.002972618443891406, 'caring': 0.0033537261188030243, 'confusion': 0.0002610339433886111, 'curiosity': 0.00020605673489626497, 'desire': 0.0035268713254481554, 'disappointment': 0.00015329652524087578, 'disapproval': 0.0003725948045030236, 'disgust': 9.737125947140157e-05, 'embarrassment': 4.15163958678022e-05, 'excitement': 0.00035666063195094466, 'fear': 0.00013606289576273412, 'gratitude': 0.8649840354919434, 'grief': 9.551333641866222e-05, 'joy': 0.0005555083625949919, 'love': 0.00025276787346228957, 'nervousness': 6.0529171605594456e-05, 'optimism': 0.11808343976736069, 'pride': 0.00018812509370036423, 'realization': 0.0005374972824938595, 'relief': 0.00034058946766890585, 'remorse': 0.0005614956608042121, 'sadness': 0.000218975284951739, 'surprise': 0.00010302999726263806, 'neutral': 0.0010607732692733407}"

 The  immune  response  can  be  described  as  a  defense  mechanism  by  which  the  
body
 
rids
 
its
 
of
 
potentially
 
harmful
 
antigens.
 
An
 
immune
 
response
 
that
 
persists
 
and
 
causes
 
damage
 
to
 
the
 
host
 
can
 
be
 
termed
 
as
 
a
 
hypersensitivity.
 
Type
 
I
 
hypersensitivities
 
are
 
commonly
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
allergies
 
and
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
antigens
 
that
 
trigger
 
type
 
I
 
hypersensitivities
 
are
 
called
 
allergens.
 
Examples
 
of
 
common
 
food
 
allergens
 
include
 
peanuts,
 
milk,
 
eggs,
 
fish
 
and
 
soybeans.
  
According
 
to
 
FARE,
 
Food
 
Allergy
 
Research
 
and
 
Education,
 
approximately
 
33
 
million
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
food
 
allergy.
 
These
 
reaction
 
symptoms
 
vary
 
from
 
uncomfortable
 
hives
 
and
 
angioedema
 
on
 
the
 
skin,
 
to
 
more
 
serious
 
conditions
 
like
 
asthma,
 
rhinitis
 
or
 
anaphylaxis.
 
  Currently,the  Food  Allergen  Labeling  and  Consumer  Protection  Act  (FALCPA)  
that
 
was
 
passed
 
in
 
2004
 
created
 
essential
 
guidelines
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
by
 
requiring
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
labeling
 
of
 
major
 
food
 
allergens
 
on
 
packaged
 
food
 
products.
 
The
 
proposed
 
regulation
 
from
 
The
 
Alcohol
 
and
 
Tobacco
 
Tax
 
and
 
Trade
 
Bureau
 
(TTB)
 
to
 
require
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
alcohol
 
beverages
 
is
 
an
 
initiative
 
that
 
is
 
substantial
 
for
 
public
 
health.
 
The
 
comments
 
provided
 
in
 
this
 
document
 
lay
 
out
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
expand
 
on
 
the
 
minimal
 
requirement
 
of
 
providing
 
an
 
allergen
 
list
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
and
 
how
 
industry
 
can
 
best
 
adjust
 
to
 
the
 
new
 
compliance.
 
  There  are  alternative  ways  of  displaying  a  major  food  allergen  disclosure,  such  
as
 
the
 
example
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
TTB,
 
by
 
allowing
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
available
 
through
 
a
 
website
 
using
 
a
 
quick
 
response
 
code
 
(QR
 
code)
 
or
 
website
 
address
 
on
 
the
 
label.
  
A
 
QR
 
code
 
enhances
 
accessibility
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
modern
 
consumers
 
by
 
offering
 
detailed
 
information
 
without
 
cluttering
 
labels.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
reduce
 
printing
 
costs
 
and
 
allow
 
real-time
 
updates
 
to
 
ingredient
 
disclosures
 
online.
 
However,
 
reliance
 
on
 
digital
 
methods
 
alone
 
may
 
not
 
adequately
 
serve
 
all
 
consumers,
 
particularly:
 
older
 
individuals
 
or
 
those
 
without
 
smartphones,
 
and
 
consumers
 
in
 
areas
 
with
 
limited
 
internet
 
access.
 
I
 
recommend
 
to
 
allow
 
alternative
 
disclosures
 
like
 
QR
 
codes
 
or
 
URLs
 
only
 
as
 
a
 
supplement,
 
not
 
a
 
replacement,
 
for
 
on-label
 
allergen
 
declarations.
   The  U.S.  Tape  &  Label  highlights  the  importance  of  a  well-designed  label  to  
capture
 
attention
 
and
 
communicate
 
a
 
brand’s
 
essential
 
information
 
about
 
their
 
product’s
 
cautionary
 
warnings.
 
A
 
survey
 
by
 
Label
 
Insight
 
reveals
 
that
 
94%
 
of
 
consumers
 
are
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
loyal
 
to
 
that
 
brand's
 
products
 
through
 
transparency
 
from
 
detailed
 
labels.

communicating
 
allergens
 
to
 
consumers
 
to
 
increase
 
brand
 
loyalty.
  
 
The  proposed  compliance  date  appears  to  strike  a  reasonable  balance  between  
consumer
 
safety
 
and
 
industry
 
adaptation.
 
A
 
sufficient
 
transition
 
period
 
allows:
 
exhausting
 
existing
 
label
 
inventories,
 
spreading
 
out
 
reformulation
 
or
 
redesign
 
costs,
 
and
 
training
 
staff
 
on
 
new
 
compliance
 
protocols.
 
For
 
small
 
businesses
 
especially,
 
an
 
extended
 
compliance
 
window
 
helps
 
absorb
 
costs
 
and
 
avoid
 
disruptions
 
to
 
operations.
 
While
 
a
 
shorter
 
compliance
 
period
 
could
 
offer
 
quicker
 
consumer
 
protection
 
benefits,
 
the
 
practical
 
challenges
 
for
 
small
 
businesses,
 
like
 
supply
 
chain
 
disruptions
 
and
 
label
 
redesign
 
timelines,
 
may
 
outweigh
 
the
 
marginal
 
gains.
 
However,
 
TTB
 
could
 
consider
 
a
 
tiered
 
compliance
 
approach,
 
in
 
that
 
larger
 
manufacturers
 
meet
 
earlier
 
deadlines,
 
and
 
small
 
businesses
 
are
 
granted
 
additional
 
time.
 
So
 
as
 
recommended,
 
if
 
consumer
 
safety
 
risks
 
are
 
substantial,
 
a
 
phased
 
rollout
 
based
 
on
 
company
 
size
 
or
 
product
 
type
 
could
 
offer
 
a
 
compromise.
 
Many  industry  members  may  begin  adopting  new  allergen  labeling  practices  in  advance  
of
 
the
 
final
 
compliance
 
date,
 
especially
 
during
 
routine
 
label
 
redesign
 
cycles.
 
Benefits
 
of
 
early
 
compliance
 
include:
 
improved
 
consumer
 
trust
 
and
 
transparency,
 
reduced
 
risk
 
of
 
allergen-related
 
incidents
 
sooner,
 
smoother
 
industry
 
transition
 
by
 
spreading
 
out
 
implementation.
  A  Canadian  study  utilized  a  discrete  choice  experiment  to  assess  consumer  
preferences
 
for
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling.
 
The
 
findings
 
indicated
 
that
 
consumers
 
place
 
high
 
importance
 
on
 
clear
 
allergen
 
labeling,
 
suggesting
 
that
 
earlier
 
implementation
 
could
 
enhance
 
consumer
 
safety.
 
However,
 
the
 
study
 
also
 
implies
 
that
 
a
 
balance
 
must
 
be
 
struck
 
to
 
avoid
 
imposing
 
undue
 
burdens
 
on
 
small
 
businesses.
  The  proposed  rule  is  a  positive  step  toward  enhanced  consumer  safety  and  industry  
transparency.
 
With
 
appropriate
 
accommodations,
 
such
 
as
 
hybrid
 
disclosure
 
methods,
 
staggered
 
compliance
 
timelines,
 
and
 
support
 
for
 
small
 
businesses.
 
The
 
regulatory
 
goals
 
can
 
be
 
met
 
effectively
 
and
 
efficiently.

Re:  
Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket 
No. TTB-2025-0003) 
To Whom It May Concern: 
On behalf of AAFA, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, thank you for the 
opportunity to offer comments on proposed mandatory major food allergen labeling 
for wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages with alcohol content.  AAFA is the leading 
patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma 
and allergy patient group in the world.  We are dedicated to improving the quality of 
life for people with allergic diseases and asthma through education, advocacy and 
research.   
AAFA strongly supports the proposal to mandate major allergen labeling on the 
alcoholic beverages under the Bureau’s jurisdiction.  Our position, and responses to 
some of the specific questions posed by the Bureau, are detailed below. 
The importance of mandatory major allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages 
Many consumers of alcoholic beverages have food allergies.  Over 10 percent of 
adults in the United States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have 
experienced at least one food-allergy-related emergency department visit.1  
Exposure to an allergen can trigger reactions ranging from mild symptoms like 
isolated hives to a more severe, multi-system reaction called anaphylaxis, which is 
potentially life-threatening.

and Severity of Food Allergies Among US Adults.  JAMA Open Network. 2019; 2: e185630

Concerns about allergens in alcoholic beverages are not theoretical.  Wines, distilled 
spirits and beers can contain undisclosed allergens, either used as processing agents 
or as ingredients.2  For example, wine may contain residue from egg albumen, casein 
(milk protein), chitin (fiber from crustacean shells), fish oil, gelatin (protein from 
boiling animal parts) and isinglass (gelatin from fish bladder membranes).
3 
Consuming these particles in wine can trigger reactions for people allergic to these 
foods.4  Craft beers and liqueurs can also contain allergenic ingredients.   
To prevent a reaction, people with allergies must avoid foods and beverages 
containing their allergen.  For over two decades, the Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) has required major allergen labeling for 
FDA-regulated foods and beverages, making it far easier for people navigating food 
allergies to stay healthy.  FALCPA applies to the “top nine” allergens – milk, egg, fish, 
crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.   
Alcoholic beverages do not fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction.  However, when FALCPA 
was enacted, a House committee report noted that the committee expected the Tax 
and Trade Bureau to develop allergen labeling for alcoholic beverages.
5  As the 
preamble details, TTB has taken a long route to reaching the current proposal, and 
we strongly support its finally being enacted.  Mandatory labeling is crucial to provide 
consistent, reliable information to consumers.

Committee expects, consistent with the November 30, 1987 Memorandum of Understanding, that 
the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the Department of Treasury will pursuant 
to the Federal Alcohol Administration Act determine how, as appropriate, to apply allergen labeling 
of beverage alcohol products and the labeling requirements for those products. The Committee 
expects that the TTB and the FDA will work together in promulgation of allergen regulations, with 
respect to those products.”

While not directly addressed by this proposed rule, AAFA also strongly supports the 
mandatory inclusion of an ingredient list for alcoholic beverages.  Many people have 
allergies to foods that are not in the “top nine,” and need to know when their allergens 
are present in a food or drink.  In addition, this basic requirement would simply bring 
alcoholic beverages in line with what consumers are entitled to know about the 
ingredients of their FDA-regulated foods.  Similarly, to ensure the health and nutrition 
of all consumers, AAFA believes information on nutrition and serving sizes should be 
required on labels.  This would allow consumers to assess both their intake of alcohol, 
to stay within recommended safety guidelines,6 and their overall consumption of 
calories from alcoholic beverages,7,8 helping address obesity and related disease.  
 
Wording and Placement of the Labeling Statement 
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, in our 2024 comments AAFA 
encouraged TTB to hew as closely as possible to allergen labeling on FDA-regulated 
foods.9  Consumers with food allergies are familiar with FDA labeling, and would be 
able to most easily transition to a model that looks similar. 
We understand that this proposed rule does not address full ingredient listing 
requirements, and that the presence or absence of such a requirement could 
influence the allergen labeling.  Therefore: 
- If there is no full ingredient labeling requirement, AAFA supports TTB’s proposal 
to require “Contains Major Food Allergens:” followed by the relevant food

sources.  We agree that using the modifier “Major” can help reduce confusion 
regarding whether other, non-“top” allergens are addressed.  We do not 
support the inclusion of allergens in a voluntary ingredients statement 
because this would create inconsistency across products for consumers.  
Other ingredients (such as sulfites) should be listed in a statement that is 
separate from the “Contains Major Allergens” statement. 
 
- In the context of full ingredients listing, we would support TTB echoing the FDA’s 
requirements for major allergen labeling (permitting inclusion of allergens in 
the ingredients list or in a Contains statement). 
 
In either scenario, AAFA encourages TTB to require that all disclosures appear in one 
place on the label, with standard placement, type, size and presentation 
requirements to ensure consumer ease.  We note that a 2022 meta-analysis of 
studies that assessed health warning labels on alcohol bottles found that placement 
of the label, as well as size, were associated with attention paid to them by 
consumers.10  While allergen labels are somewhat different from other alcohol 
warnings because consumers with allergens will likely specifically seek them out, TTB 
should still consider minimum size requirements and consistent placement to ensure 
that this information is easy for consumers to find and read. 
AAFA strongly urges TTB to ensure that, as for FDA-regulated foods, major allergen 
information is included on the label itself, and not provided separately via QR code or 
any other electronic link.  On-package labeling is the standard for FDA-regulated 
products and ensures that all consumers, regardless of technology access or skills, 
can understand the information and make decisions to protect their health. 
Compliance Date 
AAFA encourages TTB to establish a compliance date of 3.5 years or less from the 
date of publication of a final rule.  This policy has been under discussion for decades, 
and producers of alcoholic beverages should be able to accomplish this on that

timeframe.  TTB should work to assist any small producers who present with questions 
or need technical support to comply. 
Conclusion  
AAFA strongly supports common-sense regulation to mandate major allergen 
labeling for wine, distilled spirits and malt beverages, to align with FDA’s requirements 
and consistently protect consumer health.  If you would like any further information

Requiring the consumer to use technology such as a QR code creates accessibility barriers on various layers and may lead to undue risk. Whether in a retail store or at a commercial establishment, there are many liquor-based products that require dairy in their formulation as a primary example, it may be difficult for someone with an allergy or sensitivity to work through the technology hurdle to access the information they require with haste and certainty of accuracy.

visits
 
increased
 
throughout
 
the
 
15
 
years.
 
With
 
this
 
rising
 
trend
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
wise
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
proactive
 
regulation
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
reactionary
 
regulation.
 
  According  to  the  National  Survey  on  Drug  Use  and  Health  of  2023,  there  were  224.3  million  
people
 
ages
 
12
 
and
 
older
 
or
 
79.1%
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
had
 
drunk
 
alcohol
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
in
 
their
 
life.
 
A
 
rough
 
calculation
 
would
 
determine
 
that
 
approximately
 
13.7
 
million
 
people
 
have
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
consume
 
or
 
have
 
consumed
 
alcohol.
 
With
 
such
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
population
 
consuming
 
alcohol,
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
presents
 
a
 
health
 
risk
 
to
 
some
 
individuals.
 
Most
 
other
 
processed
 
products
 
and
 
products
 
that
 
contain
 
added
 
ingredients
 
require
 
there
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
allergen
 
label.
 
Though
 
the
 
products
 
that
 
fall
 
under
 
these
 
regulations
 
are
 
guided
 
by
 
the
 
FDA
 
while
 
alcohol
 
is
 
not.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
detriment
 
to
 
consumers
 
as
 
most
 
Americans
 
would
 
infer
 
that
 
since
 
the
 
Food
 
Allergen
 
Labeling
 
and
 
Consumer
 
Protection
 
(FALCPA)
 
Act
 
of
 
2004
 
and
 
Food
 
Allergy
 
Safety,
 
Treatment,
 
Education
 
and
 
Research
 
(FASTER)
 
Act
 
of
 
2021
 
that
 
alcohol
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
covered.
 
It
 
would
 
inherently
 
be
 
sensible
 
for
 
commonly
 
consumed
 
products
 
to
 
also
 
have
 
food
 
allergen
 
labeling.
 
  Another  concern  for  not  labeling  major  allergens  besides  the  health  ramifications  of  some  groups  
is
 
the
 
moral
 
and
 
religious
 
aspect
 
to
 
it.
 
There
 
are
 
certain
 
religious
 
groups
 
that
 
consume
 
alcohol,
 
but
 
maintain
 
dietary
 
restrictions
 
for
 
some
 
food
 
items.
 
In
 
Catholicism
 
and
 
Eastern
 
Orthodoxy
 
some
 
fasting
 
periods
 
can
 
restrict
 
meat,
 
dairy,
 
and
 
fish.
 
In
 
Judaism,
 
the
 
Kosher
 
laws
 
prohibit
 
foods
 
such
 
as
 
pork
 
and
 
shellfish,
 
meat
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
consumed
 
if
 
kosher-slaughtered,
 
and
 
forbid
 
meat
 
and
 
dairy
 
from
 
mixing
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
meal.
 
Additionally
 
some
 
grains
 
are
 
restricted
 
during
 
passover.
 
Without
 
clear
 
labeling
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages,
 
it
 
may
 
make
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
adhere
 
to
 
their
 
faith
 
and
 
could
 
inadvertently
 
consume
 
ingredients
 
that
 
conflict
 
with
 
their
 
religious
 
beliefs.
  That  being  said,  there  are  people  who  avoid  certain  foods  due  to  general  moral  concerns  such  as  
milk,
 
eggs,
 
and
 
other
 
animal-derived
 
ingredients.
 
These
 
concerns
 
could
 
rise
 
from
 
industry
 
standards
 
or
 
practices
 
that
 
make
 
people
 
more
 
concise
 
of
 
what
 
they
 
consume.
 
The
 
addition
 
of
 
major
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
allows
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
choose
 
thoroughly
 
what
 
they
 
put
 
into
 
their
 
own
 
bodies.
 
Providing
 
clear
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
could
 
assist
 
people
 
in
 
choosing
 
what
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
personal
 
values
 
and
 
dietary
 
restrictions.
 
  Implementing  allergen  labeling  on  certain  alcoholic  beverages  is  a  matter  of  public  health,  the  
rights
 
of
 
a
 
consumer,
 
and
 
can
 
assist
 
ethical
 
considerations.
 
Without
 
clear
 
transparency
 
in
 
labeling
 
individuals
 
with
 
allergies
 
could
 
be
 
at
 
risk
 
and
 
consumers
 
could
 
mistakenly
 
by
 
breaking
 
ethical
 
or
 
religious
 
observances.
 
Especially
 
with
 
the
 
rise
 
of
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
the
 
dangers
 
that
 
come
 
with
 
them,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
alcohol
 
to
 
have
 
similar
 
labeling
 
requirements
 
as
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
drinks.

I agree with this proposition and advocate for its approval as keeping the labeling legislation for alcoholic beverages poses severe risks to consumers with those major allergies. Most advocates on this matter believe the FDA and its allergen and nutritional label guidelines are sufficient regulations to be placed upon the wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The opposition to this issue is very little as to oppose such a motion may paint that party in a negative light and make them an indisputable opponent to public health in the United States. I will lay out my argument for the approval of this regulation and for it to follow FDA standards of transparency for the products affected.

Firstly, I would like to explain and expose the issues with the current labeling system imposed by the TTB and its inadequacy. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms current policy of product transparency focuses on warning consumers of general safety and possible harm from the product. While important, they neglect to inform people of what is inside these products (Quinn). These safety warnings can be acceptable for some of the items this bureau is responsible for, such as firearms, but it is woefully inadequate for consumed products like alcohol. This is especially apparent when other products that are ingested like food, soft drinks, etc. are controlled by a completely different entity with the FDA and under that department face much stricter regulatory guidelines as products that are meant for ingestion, if left unregulated, pose a much greater risk to all members of society. When compared to firearms for example, which not all people interact with nor have to as opposed to drink products which are universally consumed. While I am not advocating for the transition of responsibility of wine, distilled spirts, and malt beverages to move from the TTB to the FDA, I still believe a lot can be achieved by imposing similar labeling system for similar products under their respective jurisdiction, like the case with alcohol.

There are millions of adults in the U.S. with food allergies, and they are at risk of coming into contact with their allergens inside alcohol. “Over 10 percent of adults in the Unites States have food allergies, and 38% of these adults have experienced at least one foo-related emergency department visit” (Mendez). The nine major food allergens are Milk, Sesame, Soybeans, wheat, Peanuts, Tree nuts, Crustations, Shellfish, Fish and Eggs (Program). While some of these ingredients seem impracticable in a beverage with alcohol, many of these food products find their way into drinks like casein, chitin, fish oil, gelatin, etc. (Mendez). Even more allergens are added in the middle of production to add qualities and are removed later on but can still leave trace amounts (Quinn). Even with these possible exposures, there are very few cases of reactions to alcoholic beverages, but this number many be affected by underreporting as only the FDA has the proper reaction reporting system in place (Quinn) Still, many of these adults are in fear as many products have been proven to contain allergen particles, but the industry as a whole has refused to disclose this possibly life-saving information.

Despite the necessity, there is some possible pushback from the industry as they are concerned about loss of profit. For the producers, entering into a mandatory allergen disclosure, similar to the FDA’s, would mean facilities would have to be inspected and factories would be responsible for controlling the handling of allergen material (Program). They would also have to remake transparent packaging and possibly incur loss of consumers once they become aware of the possible allergens in the product (Quinn). However, it should be argued that regulations like this should already have been implemented upon the production of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages as a consumable product. Just because it is controlled by another agency does not mean it can have special exceptions to general safety procedures to protect the people and public health as a whole. I believe any outward opposition, regardless of the reasoning or possible personal loss, should be viewed as an opponent to public health of all United States adults and their point be disregarded. It could even be argued that an increase of transparency between consumer and producer would increase sales as those with allergens who have been skeptical in the past could be assured safety in consumption of the product.

In conclusion, the safety and wellbeing of all adult Americans who drink alcohol will be affected whether the vote is affirmative or not. I have come here to voice my opinion that the TTB should move forward with a mandatory allergen labeling system and that it would be beneficial to consumers for it to resemble that of the FDAs. This would allow for an easy transition in systems and consistent transparency across the U.S. food and beverage industries.

major
 
food
 
allergens
 
that
 
are
 
present
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.
 
Consumers
 
have
 
a
 
right
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
is
 
in
 
their
 
drinks;
 
therefore,
 
I
 
am
 
very
 
optimistic
 
about
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule.
 
Having
 
clear
 
and
 
concise
 
labels
 
that
 
involve
 
popular
 
allergies,
 
like
 
dairy
 
and
 
peanuts,
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
significantly
 
positive
 
impact
 
on
 
consumers.
 
Although
 
I
 
completely
 
agree
 
with
 
this
 
proposal,
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
add
 
additional
 
comments
 
and
 
opinions.
 
   An  article,  by  the  “Center  For  Science  In  The  Public  Interest,”  mentioned  how  11%  of  
adults
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
live
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
to
 
over
 
170
 
different
 
food
 
products
 
(2024).
 
Although
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
huge
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
population,
 
it
 
still
 
affects
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
Americans
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
handled
 
lightly.
 
Alcoholic
 
beverages
 
should
 
have
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
guidelines
 
for
 
ingredient
 
labeling
 
that
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
beverage
 
companies
 
do.
 
Not
 
only
 
is
 
this
 
making
 
it
 
fair
 
for
 
the
 
consumers
 
who
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
careful
 
with
 
what
 
foods
 
they
 
consume,
 
it
 
will
 
also
 
benefit
 
curious
 
individuals
 
who
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
more
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
putting
 
into
 
their
 
bodies.
 
Considering
 
many
 
wines
 
and
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
well
 
detailed
 
list
 
of
 
every
 
single
 
ingredient
 
listed,
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
individuals
 
who
 
do
 
not
 
get
 
to
 
enjoy
 
these
 
beverages
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
unknown
 
of
 
what
 
it
 
contains.
 
While
 
some
 
drinks
 
clearly
 
contain
 
allergens,
 
others
 
use
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
production
 
process
 
which
 
can
 
inhibit
 
consumers
 
from
 
realizing
 
these
 
ingredients
 
are
 
present
 
(Food
 
Labeling,
 
2024).
 
In
 
an
 
article
 
about
 
food
 
labeling,
 
it
 
explains
 
how
 
cross-contact
 
of
 
certain
 
ingredients
 
are
 
unavoidable
 
(2024).
 
With
 
this
 
being
 
said,
 
requiring
 
a
 
label
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
potential
 
allergens
 
would
 
provide
 
much
 
needed
 
transparency
 
and
 
safer
 
consumption
 
for
 
consumers.
 
  In  my  opinion,  there  are  a  lot  of  details  that  need  to  be  revised  before  the  proceeding  of  
this
 
rule.
 
One
 
concern
 
is
 
whether
 
the
 
rule
 
will
 
require
 
labeling
 
for
 
allergens
 
that
 
are
 
barely
 
detected
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
products.
 
Could
 
there
 
still
 
be
 
a
 
potential
 
allergic
 
reaction
 
to
 
an
 
ingredient
 
that
 
has
 
very
 
low
 
levels
 
present?
 
There
 
should
 
be
 
clear
 
and
 
concise
 
guidelines
 
about
 
what
 
ingredients
 
to
 
disclose
 
on
 
the
 
label.
 
It
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
have
 
“may
 
contain”
 
ingredients
 
so
 
consumers
 
can
 
be
 
cautious
 
of
 
the
 
cross
 
contamination
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
present
 
during
 
the
 
production
 
process
 
(Cross-Contact,
 
2025).
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
in
 
allowing
 
enough
 
warning
 
to
 
buyers
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
list
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
added
 
ingredients
 
that
 
may
 
only
 
be
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
making
 
process
 
and
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
finished
 
product.
 
  Another  thing  I  would  like  to  address  is  the  compliance  period.  Although  there  is  a  five  
year
 
phase
 
in
 
period,
 
businesses
 
would
 
still
 
be
 
affected
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
extra
 
work
 
and
 
costs
 
that
 
go
 
into
 
this
 
new
 
rule.
 
According
 
to
 
an
 
article
 
about
 
government
 
affairs
 
updates,
 
the
 
TTB
 
struck
 
down
 
ideas
 
of
 
creating
 
a
 
separate
 
compliance
 
rule
 
for
 
smaller
 
producers
 
(Sorini,
 
2025).
 
However,
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
for
 
TTB
 
to
 
consider
 
funds
 
to
 
help
 
with
 
smaller
 
wineries
 
and
 
breweries
 
to
 
assist
 
the
 
transition
 
for
 
safer
 
and
 
more
 
in
 
depth
 
labeling.
 
Alcoholic
 
beverage
 
producers
 
would
 
also
 
have
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
their
 
products
 
to
 
be
 
thoroughly
 
tested
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
different
 possible  allergens.  The  strain  that  this  would  put  on  companies,  especially  smaller  businesses,  
could
 
be
 
detrimental
 
to
 
them
 
(Sorini,
 
2025).
  Another  concern  that  I  have  is  the  labeling  needs  to  be  clear  and  large  enough  for  
consumers
 
to
 
read
 
and
 
understand.
 
Not
 
only
 
will
 
this
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
buyers
 
to
 
quickly
 
identify
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
possible
 
allergens
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
present,
 
it
 
also
 
will
 
not
 
allow
 
for
 
any
 
confusion
 
or
 
possible
 
discrepancies.
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
proposed
 
rule
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
step
 
for
 
making
 
all
 
food
 
and
 
beverages
 
transparent
 
in
 
the
 
ingredients
 
used
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
product.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
understand
 
why
 
consumer
 
safety
 
is
 
not
 
already
 
a
 
huge
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
alcohol
 
industry.
 
If
 
all
 
other
 
food
 
and
 
drink
 
labeling
 
require
 
adequate
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
ingredients
 
present,
 
why
 
would
 
alcohol
 
not
 
fit
 
into
 
the
 
same
 
category?
  In  conclusion,  I  support  the  proposed  allergen  labeling  rule  because  it  will  help  protect  
people
 
with
 
food
 
allergies
 
and
 
provide
 
greater
 
transparency.
 
However,
 
I
 
urge
 
TTB
 
to
 
take
 
more
 
action
 
to
 
help
 
smaller
 
producers
 
during
 
this
 
transition.
 
I
 
would
 
also
 
like
 
for
 
the
 
consideration
 
of
 
“may
 
contain”
 
labels
 
and
 
ensuring
 
the
 
allergens
 
present
 
are
 
easy
 
to
 
read.
 
With
 
these
 
considerations
 
in
 
mind,
 
this
 
rule
 
can
 
be
 
both
 
practical
 
and
 
effective
 
for
 
helping
 
allergy
 
awareness
 
in
 
alcoholic
 
beverages.

This is for the safety of the public and for those choosing to engage in such activates. In 2006, food allergies in the nine categories were “estimated to affect about four million individuals in the United States” (Porter, 2006). Today, it could be more. The labeling of products is important to the public to ensure that everyone knows what they are ingesting. This could have a positive impact on business because those who are unsure whether a beverage contains any allergies, they may choose to avoid beverage out of caution. However, if labels are implemented onto either the packaging or onto the bottles/cans one could indulge as well creating more business.   A 2020 study showed that the way labels are implemented does have some impact. For instance, there was an 80% preference for bold facing the allergenic ingredients (Blom, 2020). This would immediately draw the eye to the components that would be most important clarifying and visually acknowledge ingredients that could be harmful. Additionally, 71% of the labels had a separate allergenic section (Blom, 2020). Once again, clarifying normal ingredients to ingredients that could be of harm. Having a section dedicated specifically to allergies could be more beneficial to someone who knows they have an allergy, as they would need to spend less time looking through the ingredients to determine if the beverage is safe for them to consume.   Further with labeling, the regulation mentioned the use of QR codes to easily display nutrients, allergies, and other information that may be of importance. There are some benefits to QR codes, especially for small business. “The most important advantage is that the QR Code can carry more information in a small space because they can be read vertically or horizontally” (Brabazon, 2014). With this, a smaller code that is big enough to be read by a cellphone can have a price benefit for business. Labels, and the production of them, can consume a lot of space and be costly of the manufacturer. Usually, when there is more of something, the price rises. By keeping a barcode small, but accessible, it would allow business consumers to apply these labels, inform consumers of the product, all while keeping the price at a reasonable cost. Some countries, such as the Australian winemaker, Jacob’s Creek (Brabazon, 2024) has already added QR codes onto the back of the bottles. This allows for the information that isn’t directly on the bottle to be placed in a separate location that is easily accessible to majority of the public.  I feel these changes to beverages such as wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages should be considered. The categories mentioned as major food allergies “are estimated to cause more than 90% of all food reactions” (Porter, 2006). Because of the amount of people that have potentially life-threatening allergies, they should be able to consume beverages without the worry of being in danger. I feel that it should be a right, just like with all other consumable for people to know what they are consuming. Therefore, the ingredients list should clearly specify the ingredients of the drink. I do believe that incorporating “Contains Major Food Allergens…” over “Contains:…” would be a good incorporation into specifying that not every allergen would be included but rather the major allergies. Today, there are a lot of different allergies not including the nine major categories. Other allergies such as food dyes, have been a common allergy and should also be incorporated into the labeling process. Recent discoveries have made the FDA aware about the dangers of red food dye. Beforehand, however, this dye was used in many foods and drinks, but since then has stopped. Likewise, a study found that a yellow-brown dye was used in some foods and in color liqueurs. The reaction from ingesting the dye caused anaphylactic reactions but also “chronic urticaria,” or also known as welts. The proportion of people with hypersensitive reactions was very small only affecting “.01-0.23% of the population but 2-7% of people with atopic backgrounds” (Treduler, 2022). Although the proportion is small, it is still a danger and people have the right to know for their own safety what is in the drinks. Safety, both for individuals and for a company should be a priority.   I believe that adding these changes, in a consistent and in a timely manner, do make a difference. Ease of access is a priority for a lot of people, and knowing the ingredients of food and beverages is a source of comfort for a lot of people as well. I think with additions such as labeling can make a difference in the consumer rate of some of these products. As a result, increasing business, and reaching new consumers that this business may not have reached before, but also providing those with allergies comfort and inclusion to activities they may have not had before.   Thank you for your consideration.  Citations  Blom, W.

2 of 3Comments from P. R. China on United States Notification
G/TBT/N/USA/2183
The draft regulation stipulated that distilled liquor products with ""no protein residue
after complete distillation"" may be exempted from the requirement of labeling major
food allergen statements. However, TTB will evaluate compliance by using
scientifically effective analytical methods to verify the absence of proteins in the
distilled components, which can reliably detect the presence of proteins or protein
fragments in the finished product. According to the transparency principle of
WTO/TBT, it is recommended to clarify the testing methods and verification
procedures of regulatory agencies.
Comments in Chinese are as below:
法规提案规定 “完全蒸馏后无蛋白质残留” 的蒸馏酒产品可豁免标注主要食
物过敏原声明标签要求， 但 TTB 将通过使用科学有效的分析方法验证蒸馏成分中

I’m writing as the owner of Three Sisters Winery, aka, Chestatee Valley Vintners to
share my concerns about TTB’s proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and No. 238, which
would require new “Alcohol Facts” labels on wine bottles.
While I support educating consumers, this rule would create serious financial challenges
for small wineries in Georgia. Redesigning labels and testing for nutritional content is
costly and time-consuming—especially for small producers like us.
There are better ways to promote health awareness without hurting local businesses.
Public campaigns or online education tools could inform consumers without forcing
costly label changes.
Please consider the impact of this rule on Georgia’s wine industry and the small
businesses that support our state’s economy and agriculture.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
Sharon V. Paul

I’m writing as the owner of Three Sisters Winery, aka, Chestatee Valley Vintners to share my concerns about TTB’s proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and No. 238, which would require new “Alcohol Facts” labels on wine bottles.



While I support educating consumers, this rule would create serious financial challenges for small wineries in Georgia. Redesigning labels and testing for nutritional content is costly and time-consuming—especially for small producers like us.



There are better ways to promote health awareness without hurting local businesses. Public campaigns or online education tools could inform consumers without forcing costly label changes.



Please consider the impact of this rule on Georgia’s wine industry and the small businesses that support our state’s economy and agriculture.



Thank you for your time and attention.



Sincerely,





Sharon V. Paul

​For just about 20 years, there has been ​ongoing rulemaking about allergen labeling. ​There have been some changes but mostly small ones. Today, I believe more and more people think this ​allergen labeling is important and that​ it is a good thing for the labeling rules to adjust to.

Over the past twenty years, studies have shown an increase in allergies. Some attribute this to better testing and therefore identification. But others believe we have more allergies because of the environment around us. I also think that more and more Americans are finding that they react to allergens in different ways than before. ​Some​ ​just get a minor reaction but more are reacting more severely while others are getting more chronic allergies. It’s good to revisit whether to make allergen labeling mandatory.

As a starting point, there has ​also been a proliferation of creators of alcoholic beverages. There are now thousands of ​makers of vodka​ and other speciality alcoholic beverages. ​Many are local makers and they are regulated locally​ for production. However, I think that nationwide labeling is needed.

At this point, I believe it is important to have mandatory allergen labeling​ because there are so many brands and because so many people have allergies. I support the labeling on milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree, nuts, wheat, peanuts, soy beans, sesame. I also think that they should consider seeking comments on some of the various additive chemicals that might be present in alcohol beverages.

For just about 20 years, there has been ongoing rulemaking about allergen labeling. There have 
been some changes but mostly small ones.  Today, I believe more and more people think this 
allergen labeling is important and that it is a good thing for the labeling rules to adjust to.
Over the past twenty years, studies have shown an increase in allergies.  Some attribute this to 
better testing and therefore identification.  But others believe we have more allergies because of 
the environment around us.  I also think that more and more Americans are finding that they 
react to allergens in different ways than before. Some just get a minor reaction but more are 
reacting more severely while others are getting more chronic allergies.  It’s good to revisit 
whether to make allergen labeling mandatory.
As a starting point, there has also been a proliferation of creators of alcoholic beverages. There 
are now thousands of makers of vodka and other speciality alcoholic beverages. Many are local 
makers and they are regulated locally for production.  However, I think that nationwide labeling 
is needed.
At this point, I believe it is important to have mandatory allergen labeling because there are so 
many brands and because so many people have allergies. I support the labeling on milk, eggs, 
fish, shellfish, tree, nuts, wheat, peanuts, soy beans, sesame. I also think that they should 
consider seeking comments on some of the various additive chemicals that might be present in 
alcohol beverages.
As a young person (I am 21 years old), I believe that allergen labeling should be mandatory and I 
support this rulemaking going forward. I am open to how exactly the beverages should be 
labeled (in terms of wording), but I think that more information is better.

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

As the proprietor of Georgia Winery, | am writing to express my concerns regarding the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposed rule, Notice No. 237 and
Notice No. 238, which would mandate the inclusion of “Alcohol Facts” statements on wine
labels. While | support initiatives that promote informed consumer choices, | am
apprehensive about the economic and operational challenges this requirement may impose
on Georgia’s wine indugtry, particularly for small and family-owned wineries.

Economic Impact on Georgia’s Wine Industry

Georgia’s wine industry significantly contributes to the state’s economy, supporting local
agriculture, creating jobs, and attracting tourism. The proposed labeling changes would
necessitate comprehensive label redesigns, leading to increased production costs. For
small wineries operating with limited budgets, these additional expenses could be financially
burdensome, potentially resulting in higher product prices for consumers and reduced
competitiveness in the market.

Is more regulation really needed to help support this growing industry or harm it? | ama
believer that allowing free market forces without tight regulation provides the best platform
for successful businesses and communities. Should the government instead focus on the
root cause of allergies or other chronic illnesses instead of regulating small businesses that
are under constant attacks? We, as producers, assume all the risks of the products we
produce and are therefore naturally incentivized to produce a non-harmful products. The
more red tape, hoops to jump through, and restrictions create less growth. Conversely,
shrinking government overreach allows consumers and producers to do business freely
allowing for a mutually beneficial relationship.

Operational Challenges

Implementing the “Alcohol Facts” labeling would require wineries to conduct detailed
analyses of their products to determine accurate nutritional content. This process involves
laboratory testing and compliance verification, demanding both time and financial
resources. Small wineries may find it particularly challenging to absorb these costs without
compromising other critical aspects of their operations.

Alternative Approaches for Consumer Education

While understanding the heaith implications of alcohol consumption is essential, there are
alternative methods to educate consumers without imposing stringent labeling
requirements. Public health campaigns and digital platforms can effectively disseminate
information about responsible drinking and health risks associated with alcohol. These
approaches can reach a broad audience without adversely affecting the economic stability
of local wineries.
A blanket statement regarding the number of alcoholic drinks recommended per person is
flawed as everybody is different. Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it
does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks
consumed.

Conclusion

| urge you to consider the potential economic and operational impacts of the proposed
labeling requirements on Georgia’s wine industry. By exploring alternative strategies for
consumer education, we can achieve the goal of informed decision-making without placing
undue burdens on small businesses that are vital to our state’s economy and cultural
heritage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. | am committed to promoting responsible
consumption and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that educate
consumers while supporting the sustainability of the wine industry.

I have read the rule and questions proposed by TTB for comment and I have a few recommendations that could potentially improve the rule. <br/><br/>First, I do not believe that using an alternative method such as a website or QR code would be adequate to provide the same information to the consumer. These methods would likely cost the industry the same amount as a website as it would still require an adjustment to the label of the product. Additionally, it may be harder for consumers to access this information if they do not have compatible technology. The industry may lose business as this would be more time consuming for consumers and they will likely be less inclined to purchase the product all together. Therefore, major food allergen disclosures should be on the actual labels of the alcohol products in a position that makes it easy to read. <br/><br/>Second, while the 5-year proposed compliance date will likely reduce the cost to small businesses, however, if possible, I would recommend an incentive be imposed for businesses that comply prior to the proposed compliance date. This could help offset the cost of testing for allergen proteins and changing labeling, which would reduce the burden on the industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected. It is currently difficult to find allergen information for many of the major alcoholic beverage companies via their websites and company representatives, and even more difficult to locate this information for smaller companies and brands. The sooner the industry starts making these changes, the more likely consumers will feel comfortable purchasing products since they will confidently know whether or not it is safe for them to consume. <br/><br/>Finally, it is important for the rule to state that there shall be no amount of an allergen protein in the beverage in order for a company not to list that allergen on their label. Any trace amount of allergen protein can be detrimental for a consumer with an allergy. According to FARE (Food Allergy Research &amp; Education), 33 million Americans have food allergies and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction. TTB should require companies that claim to have distilled their beverage so that there is no allergen protein to submit these test results to TTB to ensure compliance. While this may impose a slight burden, it will also save companies from potential lawsuits that may arise from people suffering life threatening reactions to products without allergens listed. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time reviewing my comment and I appreciate your consideration of this important issue. <br/><br/>Zoe Myers<br/>Baltimore, Maryland<br/>",ma2-tx09-28j3,,Comment(s),0,,,Baltimore,MD,,United States,,Zoe,Myers,,,,,2025-04-29 00:00:00,0,2025-06-24 22:03:28,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"Docket No. TTB-2025-0003, Notice No. 238, RIN 1513-AC94<br/><br/>I am writing as an individual with allergies in support of the proposed rulemaking requiring the disclosure of all major food allergens both in and used in the production of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on said products labels.

modifications
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
rule’s
 
effectiveness
 
while
 
reducing
 
unnecessary
 
burden
 
on
 
industry.
 
The  proposed  rule  addresses  an  important  public  health  concern.  According  to  the  Centers  for  
Disease
 
Control
 
and
 
Prevention,
 
food
 
allergies
 
affect
 
approximately
 
6.2%
 
of
 
adults
 
in
 
America
 
(

For
 
these
 
people,
 
exposure
 
to
 
allergens
 
can
 
cause
 
severe
 
reactions
 
including
 
anaphylaxis,
 
a
 
potentially
 
life-threatening
 
condition
 
requiring
 
immediate
 
medical
 
attention.
 
The
 
lack
 
of
 
consistent
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
on
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
creates
 
many
 
avoidable
 
health
 
risks
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
could
 
possibly
 
be
 
allergic
 
to
 
the
 
product.
 
 
The  current  legal  framework  leaves  a  scary  gap  in  consumer  protection.  The  Food  Allergen  
Labeling
 
and
 
Consumer
 
Protection
 
Act
 
requires
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
for
 
most
 
packaged
 
foods,
 
but
 
alcoholic
 
beverages
 
that
 
are
 
regulated
 
by
 
TTB
 
have
 
been
 
free
 
from
 
these
 
requirements.
 
Being
 
free
 
from
 
these
 
requirements
 
creates
 
confusion
 
and
 
risk
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
rely
 
on
 
constant
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
when
 
buying
 
the
 
product.

However,
 TTB  has  issued  a  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking,  Notice  No.  62,  71  FR  42329,  which  proposes  to  make  the  labeling  of  major  food  allergens  mandatory.  They  also  have  published  an  interim  rule,  T.D.  TTB-53,  71  FR  42260,  which  sets  forth  standards  for  optional  allergen  labeling  statements.  The  interim  rule  went  into  effect  on  July  26,  2006  (U.S.  Department  of  Treasury.

The  proposed  rule’s  approach  to  major  allergen  disclosure  lines  up  with  established  
international
 
standards.

I  support  the  inclusion  of  all  eight  major  allergens  and  including  sesame  in  the  labeling  
requirements.
 
However,
 
I
 
think
 
these
 
following
 
modifications
 
should
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
rule:
 
1.  Shortening  the  application  period  while  the  proposed  5  year  compliance  period  might  
ease
 
industry
 
burden,
 
making
 
the
 
consumer
 
exposure
 
to
 
unlabeled
 
allergen
 
risks
 
way
 
longer
 
than
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
be.
 
The
 
food
 
industry
 
successfully
 
put
 
into
 
place
 
FALCPA
 
requirements
 
within
 
2
 
years.
 
Given
 
that
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
alcohol
 
producers
 
already
 
maintain
 
allergen
 
control
 
programs
 
and
 
documentations,
 
a
 
3
 
year
 
application
 
period
 
would
 
probably
 
work
 
better
 
to
 
balance
 
the
 
industry
 
needs
 
with
 
consumer
 
safety.
 2.  The  rule  should  clearly  address  allergens  present  in  the  processing  aids  even  if  they  are  
not
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
products.
 
This
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
finding
 
possible
 
allergens
 
used
 
in
 
wine
 
production
 
such
 
as
 
milk,
 
fish,
 
and
 
egg.
 
Even
 
though
 
these
 
processing
 
aids
 
may
 
be
 
removed,
 
little
 
amounts
 
can
 
remain
 
and
 
trigger
 
reactions
 
in
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
highly
 
sensitive.
 3.  The  rule  should  make  clear  standards  for  voluntary  “may  contain”  statements  that  
contain
 
potential
 
cross
 
contamination
 
with
 
allergens
 
during
 
production.
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
manufacturers
 
communicate
 
possible
 
risks
 
while
 
protecting
 
themselves
 
from
 
liability.
 4.  TTB  should  consider  allowing  certain  allergens  information  to  be  provided  through  digital  
means
 
such
 
as
 
QR
 
codes
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
show
 
more
 
informational
 
package
 
declarations.
 
This
 
could
 
allow
 
manufacturers
 
to
 
give
 
more
 
information
 
than
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
put
 
on
 
the
 
packaging.
 
The  economic  impact  of  putting  these  requirements  into  place  is  justified  by  the  public  health  
benefits.
 
Industry
 
costs
 
mostly
 
involve
 
label
 
redesign
 
and
 
printing,
 
which
 
many
 
manufacturers
 
do
 
regularly
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
normal
 
business
 
operations.
 
These
 
costs
 
are
 
minimal
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
potential
 
medical
 
expenses
 
and
 
lost
 
productivity
 
associated
 
with
 
allergic
 
reactions
 
if
 
the
 
consumer
 
affected
 
chooses
 
to
 
take
 
action
 
against
 
the
 
business.
 
International  experience  shows  that  allergen  labeling  requirements  do  not  significantly  impact  
the
 
market
 
competition
 
or
 
consumer
 
choice.
 
They
 
help
 
producers
 
to
 
better
 
serve
 
health-conscious
 
consumers
 
and
 
possibly
 
expand
 
their
 
market
 
reach.
 
Many
 
craft
 
producers
 
have
 
already
 
voluntarily
 
adopted
 
allergen
 
labeling,
 
showing
 
both
 
its
 
attainability
 
and
 
market
 
value.
 
Finally,  while  supporting  the  fundamental  framework  of  the  proposed  rule,  I  urge  TTB  to  
strengthen
 
consumer
 
protections
 
by
 
taking
 
into
 
consideration
 
the
 
recommended
 
modifications
 
listed
 
above.
 
The
 
growing
 
widespread
 
presence
 
of
 
food
 
allergies,
 
combined
 
with
 
increased
 
consumer
 
demand
 
for
 
transparency,
 
makes
 
easy
 
to
 
understand
 
allergen
 
labeling
 
both
 
a
 
public
 
health
 
necessity
 
and
 
a
 
market
 
opportunity.
 
The
 
proposed
 
rule
 
with
 
the
 
suggested
 
changes
 
would
 
establish
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
standard
 
that
 
protects
 
consumers
 
while
 
providing
 
the
 
industry
 
with
 
achievable
 
requirements.

Comments on Notice No. 238 - Major Food Allergen 
Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. 
 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
 
To Whom It May Concern,  
We are writing on behalf of the ""Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C."" (CIVYL), 
the united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of 
spirits wines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, 
Casa Cuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and 
Pernod Ricard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and 
implementation of public policies related to alcoholic beverages. 
Firstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and 
contribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is 
dedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of 
alcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately 
inform consumers without causing confusion. 
In this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code 
of Federal Regulations under Notice No. 238, regarding the labeling of major food allergens for 
wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. 
While we recognize the importance of providing consumers with relevant information, including 
ingredients that may cause allergies, we believe that several aspects of this proposal could lead to 
unnecessary regulatory burdens. We consider that in addition to declaring the allergen, requiring an 
additional legend or statement on labels such as “CONTAINS MAJOR FOOD ALLERGEN” 
follow by a colon and the name of the food source, may not provide additional benefits to consumers 
while potentially increasing costs for manufacturers, importers, and distributors. This may also 
not align with Article 2.2 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which states that 
technical regulations should not be developed, adopted, or applied with the effect of creating unnecessary 
obstacles to international trade to achieve the legitimate objectives of member states.  
In the other hand, the approach to allergen labeling in various regulatory frameworks emphasizes clarity 
and minimal disruption to trade, in the case of Mexico, NOM-142-SSA1/SCFI-2014 establishes that 
food allergens must be included in the ingredient list only when they are present in the final 
product, without requiring a specific warning and exclusively for liqueurs or creams, cocktails, 
and prepared beverages. 
Similarly, the Codex Alimentarius General Standard for the Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (CXS 
1-1985), was recently revised to recommend that major allergens be declared preferably within the 
ingredient list. If a separate declaration is required, it should be limited to a brief ""Contains ___"" follow 
by the name of the allergen, statement placed directly below or near the ingredient list. 
And in the case of the United States, the current voluntary major allergen declaration standard (interim 
rule, T.D. TTB-53 (71 FR 42260)) allows wines and distilled spirits to voluntarily declare allergens 
on labels using the term ""Contains,"" followed by the allergen name (e.g., ""Contains: egg"").  
As part of this, we understand the importance of declaring major food allergens to protect public health. 
It is suggested to consider two alternatives for their declaration. 
 
 
 
  
The first option is to consider presenting the name of the allergen as part of the ingredient list, 
which should only appear on the label of prepared alcoholic beverages, liqueurs, or creams, as 
well as any alcoholic beverages that, after distillation and/or before bottling, use optional 
ingredients and/or additives that may cause hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy and are present in 
the final product. 
The second option is to consider the declaration allergens immediately after the ingredient list 
using only the phrase ""Contains __."" This approach fulfills the legitimate objective of protect 
public health, provide clearer information for consumers and align with existing regulations. 
However, if it is decided to proceed to modify alcoholic beverage labeling to include allergen information, 
we strongly recommend allowing technological tools on the label to provide this additional 
information, such as electronic labeling (via QR code, digital platform, or website). 
This tool offers the following advantages: 
• Provides unlimited space for consumer information. 
• Gives consumers more information in a user-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 
• Facilitates compliance with regulatory changes. 
• Help deliver information to one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent 
harmful and excessive alcohol consumption. 
• Allows the development of engaging, educational, and interactive content for consumers. 
 
By incorporating electronic labeling, necessary information can be provided to consumers 
without overcrowding the labels of alcoholic beverages, ensuring clarity and accessibility. 
For these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less 
burdensome solutions. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Panambí Garcés 
General Manager

Notice of proposed rulemaking: Major Food Allergen Labeling 
for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages 
 
 
The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (“BNIC”) is a private institution financed by the Cognac 
professionals (producers and trade houses) and entrusted with public service missions. The objectives of 
BNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all 
Cognac stakeholders overall. 
 
On 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in 
the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring a labeling disclosure of all major food 
allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages, except for distilled spirits.   
 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exclusion for distilled spirits to label food allergens.  
 
In the case that the proposed exclusion for distilled spirits is not maintained and that distilled spirits come 
to be included in this proposed rulemaking:  
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This 
will largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized 
businesses.  
 
BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years.  
 
BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements

  De  Maison  Selections  Inc.  is  a  small  business  with  20  employees  that  imports  fine  wines,  ciders,  
and
 
spirits
 
from
 
small,
 
family-owned
 
wineries
 
in
 
France
 
and
 
Spain.
 
We
 
are
 
addressing
 
the
 
questions
 
the
 
TTB
 
raised
 
in
 
the
 
notice
 
of
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.
   
  Overall  Comment  on  Proposed  Rulemaking:  Complying  with  the  proposed  regulation  would  result  in  up-front  costs  in  both  time  and  money.  
While
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
adding
 
allergen
 
information
 
for
 
primary
 
ingredients
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
consumers,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
think
 
that
 
including
 
allergen
 
information
 
for
 
fining
 
agents
 
on
 
our
 
back
 
labels
 
would
 
enhance
 
consumer
 
health
 
and
 
safety.
 
Fining
 
agents
 
pose
 
a
 
very
 
low
 
risk
 
of
 reaction  (Peñas  et  al.,  2015;  Vassilopoulou  et  al.,  2011;  Wüthrich,  2018),  and  most  wine  intolerances  are  due  to  sulfite  sensitivity,  histamines  (not  from  fining  agents),  and  diamine  oxidase  deficiency  (Wüthrich,  2018).    Label  Wording:  The  back  label  of  wine  and  spirits  is  limited,  making  the  space  valuable.  Adding  more  
requirements
 
to
 
this
 
label
 
detracts
 
from
 
the
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
winery
 
and
 
pairings.
 
If
 
an
 
addition
 
is
 
necessary,
 
we
 
would
 
prefer
 
that
 
the
 
TTB
 
either
 
use
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
or
 
the
 
wording
 
""Contains:"".
 
We
 
favor
 
a
 
single
 
statement
 
that
 
combines
 
the
 
mandatory
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
and
 
allergens.
 
  Allergen  Placement:   We  request  that  the  arrangement  of  the  warning  labels,  allergen  labels,  and  alcohol  facts  be  left  
to
 
the
 
discretion
 
of
 
the
 
manufacturer
 
and
 
importer.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
ask
 
that
 
no
 
specific
 
requirements
 
regarding
 
placement,
 
type
 
size,
 
or
 
presentation
 
be
 
mandated.
 
Furthermore,
 
we
 
request
 
that
 
fining
 
agents
 
be
 
excluded
 
from
 
this
 
regulation.
  Peñas  et  al.  (2015),  Vassilopoulou  et  al.  (2011),  and  Wüthrich  (2018)  found  that  any  remaining  
casein,
 
isinglass,
 
or
 
egg
 
from
 
the
 
fining
 
process
 
presents
 
a
 
very
 
low
 
risk
 
of
 
allergic
 
reactions.
 
Therefore,
 
fining
 
agents
 
should
 
be
 
exempt
 
from
 
the
 
allergen
 
listing.
 
However,
 
if
 
fining
 
agents
 
must
 
be
 
listed,
 
we
 
would
 
prefer
 
the
 
allergen
 
to
 
be
 
noted
 
with
 
'processing
 
aid'
 
in
 
parentheses.
  
  Implementation  Time:    We  prefer  coordination  with  the  proposed  regulation  implementing  Alcohol  Facts  Statements  for  
labeling
 
wines,
 
distilled
 
spirits,
 
and
 
malt
 
beverages.
 
We
 
also
 
request
 
a
 
QR
 
code
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
label
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
permanent
 
allergy
 
label
 
for
 
easier
 
updates
 
per
 
vintage.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
prefer
 
a
 
5-year
 
compliance
 
timeline
 
that
 
coincides
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
Alcohol
 
Facts
 
implementation
 
timeline,
 
which
 
allows
 
our
 
producers
 
to
 
use
 
their
 
current
 
printed
 
back
 
labels.
 
  Ongoing  Costs:    Consumers  prefer  wine  labels  that  are  authentic,  unique,  and  have  personality  (Lunardo  &  
Guerinet,
 
2007);
 
however,
 
the
 
ongoing
 
regulations
 
requiring
 
warnings,
 
allergens,
 
and
 
alcohol
 
facts
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
label
 
diminish
 
the
 
information
 
that
 
consumers
 
value.
 
Therefore,
 
we
 
could
 
lose
 
sales
 
if
 
a
 
back
 
label
 
can
 
no
 
longer
 
convey
 
the
 
wine's
 
authenticity,
 
uniqueness,
 
and
 
personality.
 
  Small  Business  Impact:   As  a  small  business  importing  wine  and  distilled  spirits  from  family-owned  vineyards,  the  new  
proposed
 
requirements
 
will
 
increase
 
costs
 
for
 
our
 
business
 
and
 
foreign
 
producers.
 
The
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury
 
in
 
2022
 
found
 
that
 
some
 
laws
 
at
 
both
 
state
 
and
 
federal
 
levels
 
may
 
impose
 
a
 
disproportionate
 
burden
 
on
 
small
 
and
 
medium-sized
 
producers
 
without
 
adequate
 
justifications.
 
We
 
concur
 
with
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Treasury’s
 
findings
 
regarding
 
the
 
burdensome
 
nature
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
mandatory
 
labeling
 
measures
 
that
 
would
 
raise
 
entry
 
barriers
 
and
 
reduce
 
competition
 
in
 
an
 
already
 
highly
 
regulated
 
industry
 
(Department
 
of
 
Treasury,
 
2022).
 
We
 
contend
 
that
 
this
 
will
 
foster
 
further
 
exclusionary
 
practices
 
by
 
large
 
producers,
 
distributors,
 
and
 
retailers
 
who
 
are
 
better
 
positioned
 
to
 
absorb
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
these
 
proposed
 
labeling
 
requirements.
 
  Importer:    Data  Analyst:   Reporting  fining  material  is  requested  but  not  mandatory  for  our  information  collection.  
Therefore,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
gather
 
this
 
information
 
from
 
our
 
producers
 
and
 
enter
 
it
 
into
 
our
 
database,
 
which
 
would
 
take
 
about
 
5
 
to
 
10
 
hours
 
of
 
an
 
employee’s
 
time.
 
An
 
average
 
data
 
analyst
 
earns
 
$40
 per  hour  ( Salary ,  2025).  This  amounts  to  $200  to  $400  to  file  and  record  this  information.   Label  Making:   According  to  our  graphic  designer,  adding  a  QR  code  or  wording  to  each  label  would  take  20  
minutes.
 
Assuming
 
that
 
half
 
of
 
our
 
current
 
labels
 
require
 
allergy
 
labeling,
 
that
 
amounts
 
to
 
5,000
 minutes  or  83  hours.  An  average  graphic  designer  earns  $27  per  hour  ( Graphics  Designer  Salary ,  2025).  Adding  allergen  information  or  a  QR  code  to  our  labels  would  cost  $2,250.    Total  Cost:   The  total  cost  to  our  importing  business  for  adding  allergen  information  ranges  from  $2,450  to  
$2,650.
 
  Concluding  Statement:  We  understand  that  the  TTB  was  tasked  by  the  Department  of  Treasury  to  reexamine  its  
labeling
 
and
 
other
 
practices
 
to
 
protect
 
consumers
 
and
 
public
 
health
 
while
 
reducing
 
or
 
eliminating
 
regulatory
 
requirements
 
that
 
generate
 
compliance
 
costs
 
and
 
serve
 
as
 
barriers
 
to
 new  entrants  or  burdens  to  small  businesses  (Department  of  Treasury,  2022).  However,  this  proposed  regulation,  which  includes  fining  agents,  increases  regulatory  requirements  that  create  
compliance
 
costs
 
and
 
heighten
 
barriers
 
for
 
new
 
entrants
 
while
 
imposing
 
burdens
 
on
 
small
 businesses.  The  TTB  proposed  these  new  regulations  in  good  faith,  but  the  spirit  of  EO  14036  
has
 
been
 
lost
 
in
 
this
 
proposed
 
rulemaking.

People that consume alcohol are aware of the risks thanks to the existing government warning that is already mandatory.  These are responsible adults who are consciously choosing to imbibe with all the existing information.  Furthermore, these allergens do not survive the distillation process, and are therefore redundant and unnecessary.  This is government overreach due to misplaced good intentions.

The fact it has taken so long to require allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is quite alarming, especially while the market for alcoholic beverages and breweries has exploded. According to the Brewers Association, the number of breweries has grown six-fold over the past decade and a half [1]. However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption.<br/>To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t count&rdquo; yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public.<br/>When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 74% of respondents said they were in support of adding ingredients to the labeling, 65% supported adding allergens, and 66% supported adding calorie content [4].

Despite the favoritism, the government has made the majority of labeling policies voluntary. The CSPI found that only &ldquo;17% of labels contained an ingredients list&rdquo; [5]. In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4. This fact highlights the ongoing problems with alcohol regulation in the nutritionary field. If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that &ldquo;it gives you wiiings&rdquo; to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.<br/>",m74-1rvb-bewe,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,United States,,Lawrence,Kelly,,,,,2025-02-13 05:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:41,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 238:  Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0003,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7",2025-00955,90 FR 5763,5763 - 5778,DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT),"I believe that the proposed rule will be of much benefit to the American consumer, primarily to the reinforcement of informed consent in the purchasing of products.

I believe that the proposed rule will be of much benefit to the American consumer, primarily to the reinforcement of informed consent in the purchasing of products. The fact it has taken so long to require allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is quite alarming, especially while the market for alcoholic beverages and breweries has exploded. According to the Brewers Association, the number of breweries has grown six-fold over the past decade and a half [1]. However, I believe this rule should be amended further to include nutritional labels on all alcoholic beverages; if they are required on all other foods and drinks, they deserve to be under the same umbrella of provisions. This could potentially have immense benefits to the overall health of the American public, specifically regarding the calorie labels. According to a study by the University College London, they found that those who purchased alcohol with calorie labels went on to purchase 500 fewer calories of alcohol than those who purchased no labels [2]. At the same time, they concluded that there was little evidence to support the claim that health warning labels could reduce alcohol consumption.

To further this point of nutritional labeling being added to alcoholic beverages, an initiative should be implemented to promote education surrounding dieting and calorie counting. According to a study in 1992 conducted by New England Journal of Medicine, it was found the obese individuals in the study underreported their calorie intakes on average by 47%, while simultaneously underreporting their physical activity by 51% [3]. Through this, one can draw the conclusion that nutritional labeling is either not being read or not being understood correctly. To further this, as a college student, many of us tend to miscount or disregard calorie intake as a whole, particularly discounting alcoholic beverages when it comes to calories. I myself, along with many others I have talked to, did not realize just how many calories were in specific alcoholic beverages themselves; we were also shocked to learn just how many calories were in them. I used to ironically think that the calories “didn’t count” yet simultaneously proceeded to gain weight during heavier drinking periods. Thus, the education of calorie and nutritional labeling should see more initiatives undertaken to better inform the public.

When looking into the attitudes of customers, surveys have shown that Americans are in favor of adding labeling to alcoholic beverages. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 74% of respondents said they were in support of adding ingredients to the labeling, 65% supported adding allergens, and 66% supported adding calorie content [4]. On top of this, the CSPI found that “more than 75% of respondents” preferred reading this information on the label rather than through an online resource. Despite the favoritism, the government has made the majority of labeling policies voluntary. The CSPI found that only “17% of labels contained an ingredients list” [5]. In the ingredients claims, the amount stating they were gluten free or contained no high fructose corn syrup outnumbered the amount containing allergens by more than a factor of 4. This fact highlights the ongoing problems with alcohol regulation in the nutritionary field. If practically all other foods and beverages require nutrition labels, aside from fresh fruits, single-ingredient products, small-package foods, or on-site foods, this should be applied to alcoholic beverages too. Nutritional labels at their base serve as a vector for informed consent, particularly to prevent legal action from being taken in case of harm toward consumers. If Red Bull has to say that “it gives you wiiings” to avoid false advertising [6], and Costco has recall tens of thousands of butter due to the label not mentioning it contains butter [7], then there is no reason why any alcoholic beverage should not be required to contain a nutritional label, let alone an allergen statement.

Considering the address by the Treasury in 2022 that suggested the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau should undertake an initiative to revise the practices of labeling in regards to “protect[ing] consumers and public health”, it is appropriate to say that the support for this bill from all parties and stakeholders is present [8]. While the markets for alcoholic beverages have had distinct differences in terms of regulatory practices over the past century, lots of the market has remained unchecked. The Treasury report mentioned above highlighted the concern of the massive consolidation of the brewer market, citing that “two brewers… account for an estimated 65%” of the nation’s market for beer. Introducing labeling could potentially shift consumer preferences toward smaller brands that provide higher transparency over their beverages, potentially shrinking the faintly duopolistic beer market in present day.

Overall, it is evident that the introduction of allergen labels onto alcoholic beverages is needed and supported, and there is a strong case to be made that nutritional labels overall should be added too. Though the alcoholic beverage market is complex, it still deserves to be treated like the rest of the foods you buy in a supermarket.

Proposed Rule Assignment

Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau,

While I read through the proposed rule, I believe that food allergen labels for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages would help facilitate the buying of specific types of wine for consumers and would overall have a positive impact on commerce regarding these products. Creating a more transparent label for individuals with certain types of food allergies could help boost sales in specific types of wine, spirits, and malts as people with food allergies, such as the identified products in the proposed rule, would know to look at these kinds of beverages. Depending on the extent to which one may have an allergic reaction could be hard to pinpoint and, perhaps, vary from person to person, so having greater transparency on the bottle could relieve some stress for people with food allergies by not having to do things, such as research a bottle of wine or another beverage due to the fact there are undisclosed allergens used to make it. According to an article by Amy Greenberg of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, “over 10 percent of adults in the United States have food allergies, and 38 percent of these adults have experienced at least one food allergy related emergency department visit,” (Greenberg). This letter concerning the re-labeling and advertising of wines, spirits, and malts, also, mentions how the individual may react to a food allergen, as the response could range from shortness of breath, mild hives, or in extreme cases death. Another statistic worth noting comes from the National Library of Medicine and an article about allergic and intolerant reactions to wine. The data states that 10% of Americans are affected by hypersensitivity reactions to alcoholic beverages, one example given is red wine in particular (Wuthrich). The causes of the intolerant reactions ranged from fish gelatin to dairy products, which are some of the identified major food allergens the proposed rule discusses in its framework. This is an easily avoidable risk to prevent if the undisclosed allergens were to simply be placed on the bottle, and this is one reason the relabeling proposed rule would have my support. Another reason, I believe the proposed rule should have a fair amount of support is the fact that the framework of the rule does seem quite sound. For example, the rule’s says their definition of “major food allergen,” is consistent with that of the FD&C Act, the rule also goes on to list which specific products, for example milks, eggs, and fish, are fall under the statutory definition provided by the FD&C Act. This reason is, basically, an extension of my previous reason for supporting the proposed rule as with clear definitions consistent with other acts and statutes the process of labeling should be more streamlined, as companies would not have possible stress of ensuring their products may fall in one definition of major food allergens, but not in another. According to an article from the National Library of Medicine, 1 in every 20 Americans are burdened by cow’s milk allergy or CMA (Warren). So it is clear that ignoring having warnings or proper labeling disclosing the ingredient within a particular product could prove problematic and, perhaps, make the consumer more cautious of specific products from certain companies and potentially harm the market and have an overall negative impact on commerce. With this point, it can most definitely be argued to the extent of whether the impact on commerce would be substantial. Now, moving away from the labels themselves and the ingredients listed on them, I am also in support of the proposed rule because of the effective date and compliance with the proposed regulations the rule is suggesting. The proposed rule suggests a five year compliance period and this is good for two reasons, which the act seems to make as main concerns. The first reason being for the five year compliance period is to limit the impact on small businesses, which the consideration of small business within the proposed rule may create further support for the proposed rule amongst people within small communities where local business may be more prominent. The second reason the framework provides is that the five year compliance period would prove to be less costly than, for example, a 2 year compliance period. The framework of the cost analysis of the act shows to those who are to view the proposed rule that the longer compliance is more beneficial for the public and government spending as a whole, as the two year period would demand about $161.7 million per year, whereas the five year period would demand about $40.2 million a year. Overall, I would say the proposed rule would be beneficial for reasons of safety and the overall cost it would need to come to fruition. The definitions and parallels with existing regulations and acts would make the proposed rule one that compliments other regulations nicely, and the positive affect would be seen in the market.

RE: Docket No.  TTB-2025-0003; Notice No. 238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for  Wines, 
Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages - Request for 120-Day Extension for Comments  
 
Dear Ms. Greenberg, 
 
Wine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California 
wineries and affiliated businesses.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the 
nation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of U.S. wine exports .  Distilled Spirits 
Council of the United States (“DISCUS”) is the principal trade association for the leading 
producers and importers of distilled spirits products sold in the  U.S. and represents 
distillers of all sizes .  The Beer Institute (“BI”) represents the $ 409.2 billion beer industry –  
an industry that includes over 6,600 brewers and more than 2.4 million American jobs.  BI is 
a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing both large and 
small brewers, as well as importers and industry suppliers.  The Brewers Association (“BA”) 
seeks to promote and protect the interests of craft brewers and the craft brewing 
community, including beer consumers and home brewers. Today the BA  has roughly 5,000 
full voting brewery members – including members in every state – as well as over 1,000 allied 
trade members and over 30,000 home brewer and beer enthusiast members.   The National 
Beer Wholesalers Association’s (“NBWA”) purpose is to provide leadership, which 
enhances the independent beer and beverage distribution industry; to advocate before 
government and the public; to encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol ; and to 
Page 2 of 4 
 
provide programs and services that will benefit its members.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of 
America (“WSWA”) is the only national membership organization of wine and spirits 
distributors.  On behalf of its more than 380 member companies, WSWA advocates on their 
behalf with regards to federal, state, regulatory, and legal issues impacting distributors and 
the beverage alcohol industry.   WineAmerica is the National Association of American 
Wineries, representing wineries, winery associations, and wine industry supply companies 
across the country.  WineAmerica’s mission is to encourage the dynamic growth and 
development of American wineries  and winegrowing through the advancement and 
advocacy of sound public policy.  The American Craft Spirits Association (“ACSA”) the only 
national registered non-profit trade association representing the U.S. craft spirits industry. 
Its mission is to elevate and advocate for the community of craft spirits producers, and 
membership in ACSA is open to anyone.  American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) is a 
trade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in 
the manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and 
around the world.   
 
We refer to Wine Institute , DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA 
collectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   
 
The Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in Notice No. 
238: Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (“Notice  
238”).  The comment period for Notice 2 38 is scheduled to end on April 17, 20 25. The 
Associations request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would extend 
to August 15, 2025. 
 
As a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily 
regulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of 
the new administration.  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in 
the final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the 
first day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries 
they regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into 
place since Notice 238 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and 
midsize wineries , craft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great  costs and 
operational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even 
meaningfully participating in the comment process means  they must redirect time and 
resources. 
 
Notice 238 is expansive—i.e., 16 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10- point, single -spaced 
font—and poses at least 14 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It is 
also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that  it raises.  
Indeed, TTB acknowledges in Notice 238 that it had been almost 20  years since it last 
solicited comments on these issues .  Accordingly, it undertook two “virtual listening 
sessions” in February 2024, however, there was no proposed rule at that time and the notice 
issued just 28 days in advance of the sessions .  A ddressing these issues in response to a  
proposed rule, and nearly two decades since the last proposed rule, will necessarily require 
updated input.  That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of the proposed Page 3 of 4 
 
rule—including the many questions and requests for comments in Notice 238—and for our 
members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit the overall 
process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. 
 
It is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 23 8 will 
impact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance 
of the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey 
the input of all  our members to ensure their perspectives are  included and well-reflected.  
TTB acknowledges that the Codex Committee on Food Labelling has been discussing food 
allergen standards, allergen labeling provisions, and a possible framework for evaluating 
exemptions for food allergens .  Our members need time to review and consider that same 
work and related issues that evolved in the nearly two decades since TTB last addressed 
these issues with a proposed rule.   Moreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 23 8 on 
important but s weeping areas of interest such as comments on “ whether there are better 
alternatives” to what it proposes.  Our members will need additional time to consider other 
options available for those purposes  and then explain and discuss them  in submitted 
comments. 
 
Last, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that 
impact our members .  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing alcohol 
facts statements in the labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same 
day as Notice 238 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 238’s 
publication, the FDA published a rulemaking propos ing front-of-package labeling for 
nutrition which will also impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 
238, propose new rules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration .  We 
therefore believe a 120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. 
 
We would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request.

This requirement is essential for several reasons.<br/> <br/>Firstly, food allergies are a significant public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 32 million Americans suffer from food allergies. Currently, many consumers remain unaware that alcohol beverages often lack proper ingredient labeling, including allergen labeling requirements established by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). By requiring comprehensive ingredient disclosure, TTB would empower consumers to make safer choices, mitigating the risk of unforeseen reactions, including triggering allergic responses.<br/> <br/>Secondly, transparency in labeling aligns with modern consumer expectations and public health advocacy. In 2021, various consumer groups and public health advocates called for mandatory labeling, emphasizing that consumers should have full access to information about the content of the products they consume. The public has expressed dissatisfaction with the current voluntary labeling system, which upholds ambiguity. A standardized disclosure of all ingredients would be a significant step toward greater transparency and consumer protection.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, the TTB possesses the statutory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act to ensure that consumers receive &quot;adequate information&quot; about the identity and quality of alcohol products. The absence of mandatory ingredient labeling represents a gap in consumer protection that the TTB is well-positioned to address. Implementing such regulations would not only enhance consumer awareness but also foster trust in alcohol brands that prioritize transparency and safety.<br/> <br/>Lastly, the proposed regulations align with the TTB&#39;s mission to protect public health and well-being. By establishing uniform ingredient labeling requirements, the TTB would not only fulfill expectations set forth in previous public health initiatives but also adhere to the discussions and recommendations highlighted in the Treasury&rsquo;s Competition Report on alcohol markets.

This requirement is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, food allergies are a significant public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 32 million Americans suffer from food allergies. Currently, many consumers remain unaware that alcohol beverages often lack proper ingredient labeling, including allergen labeling requirements established by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). By requiring comprehensive ingredient disclosure, TTB would empower consumers to make safer choices, mitigating the risk of unforeseen reactions, including triggering allergic responses.

Secondly, transparency in labeling aligns with modern consumer expectations and public health advocacy. In 2021, various consumer groups and public health advocates called for mandatory labeling, emphasizing that consumers should have full access to information about the content of the products they consume. The public has expressed dissatisfaction with the current voluntary labeling system, which upholds ambiguity. A standardized disclosure of all ingredients would be a significant step toward greater transparency and consumer protection.

Furthermore, the TTB possesses the statutory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act to ensure that consumers receive ""adequate information"" about the identity and quality of alcohol products. The absence of mandatory ingredient labeling represents a gap in consumer protection that the TTB is well-positioned to address. Implementing such regulations would not only enhance consumer awareness but also foster trust in alcohol brands that prioritize transparency and safety.

Lastly, the proposed regulations align with the TTB's mission to protect public health and well-being.

This regulation proposes to require disclosure of all major food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages subject to TTB&#39;s regulatory authority, and under the proposed regulations, labels must declare milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as ingredients that contain protein derived from these foods, if used in the production of the alcohol beverage and unless one of three exceptions apply. TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register.<br/>I strongly support this proposed regulation to adopt RIN 1513-AC94.<br/>As incoming medical professionals, one rationale behind our support is ensuring accessibility of allergen advisories and safety to everyone purchasing alcoholic beverages. 33 million Americans are living with food allergies, some of whom with allergies so severe they would experience a life-threatening emergency if not adequately informed. After this regulation was first introduced, the majority of comments during public hearings were universally supportive of RIN 1513-AC94. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, a patient advocacy organization, stated that &ldquo;To the extent possible, labeling information should be displayed on alcoholic beverages similar to labeling on FDA-regulated foods. Consumers with food allergies are accustomed to FDA labeling, and would be able to easily transition to a similar model for checking the safety of alcoholic beverages . . .&rdquo;.<br/>Our support is further guided by input from professional organizations providing medical guidance related to allergen labelling. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology explains that, &ldquo;Teens and young adults may need to be reminded or taught anew that the Food Allergen Labeling Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) does not cover alcoholic beverages. Therefore, this is an unregulated area which may make determination of the ingredients of mixed alcoholic drinks difficult to ascertain. Additionally, they may encounter inconsistencies in how well educated restaurants and bar staff are about food allergy, anaphylaxis and cross-contact issues with food proteins.&rdquo;<br/>We agree that these labels should be written clearly on food products, and should not be shared via QR code, as this may disadvantage individuals without smartphones or the internet, particularly affecting older adults, low-income individuals, and those in rural or tribal areas.
