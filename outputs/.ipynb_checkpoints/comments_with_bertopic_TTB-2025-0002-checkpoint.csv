0,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'I am in complete agreement with this proposed rule. It is only fair that alcoholic beverages like every other beverage and food item on the market contain per-serving information about calories, nutrients, and, when necessary, alcohol content. The reasons why I believe this proposed rule should go into effect are the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcoholic consumption, and the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are drinking. Firstly, this proposed rule is beneficial because of the number of calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages like everything else we consume contain calories and if too many calories are consumed every day it can lead to weight gain, which we already have too much of in this country as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ldquo;on a given day, consumers of alcoholic beverages obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from alcoholic beverages&rdquo; (Nielsen et al, 2012). Assuming the consumers follow the recommendation of 2,000 calories a day that would equal 320 calories from alcoholic beverages every day. Without the proper labeling, consumers cannot know exactly how many calories they are consuming, making it extremely difficult to follow the recommended daily caloric intake if they are trying to follow it. Secondly, this proposed rule should go into effect because the United States is known to be an obese country with around 40% of adults being obese (Emmerich et al, 2024), as well as some research showing increases in obesity and heavy alcohol consumption in adults in the United States. Between 2017-2020 the combination of heavy alcohol consumption and obesity was 3.1% of adults in the United States which is up from 1.8% in 1999-2000, and it has increased 72% over time (Raza et al, 2023). That shows that not only is obesity and heavy alcohol consumption linked, but it is also on the rise. It very well could be on the rise because of the lack of consistent labeling on alcoholic beverages that do not always include the caloric value which can lead to an overconsumption of calories which in turn can cause obesity. Finally, this proposed rule should go into effect because of the benefit of knowing what is in the product you are consuming. When there is no consistent labeling among alcoholic beverages it can lead to confusion or if there is a lack of any labeling it can lead consumers to be uninformed about what they are consuming. A study of college students showed that 65% were unaware of the caloric content of the alcoholic beverages they consumed (Lloyd-Richardson et al, 2008). 65% of college students not knowing the caloric content of their alcoholic beverages is astronomically too high and this proposed rule could help lower that number by a large margin. Also, another study suggests that alcohol labeling can be effective in increasing consumers&#39; knowledge and understanding of the health risks involved in drinking alcoholic beverages (Edmunds et al, 2023). Just knowing the risks will not stop people from consuming alcoholic beverages, but it will allow them to make informed decisions moving forward, which could allow consumers to live healthier lives. Being informed about what is consumed is extremely important and is already in place for every other consumable good so it only makes sense to hold alcoholic beverages to the same standards. In conclusion, the caloric content of alcoholic beverages, the amount of obesity tied to alcohol consumption, and the benefit of increased information on alcoholic beverages are all reasons why I believe this proposed rule should become regulation under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.<br/>References: Edmunds, C.

Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \nComment for Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and \nMalt Beverages \nDear Director, \nAs the CEO of a major import and distributing company, working with hundreds of small wine \nproducers on every continent around the globe, we respectfully submit our opposition to the proposed \nAlcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. \nSince the beginning of wine making (probably dating back 7000 years), wine has been made in very \nmuch the same way. It is important to note that most wine is 85% biologically pure water, taken up \nthrough the roots and delivered to the grapes on the vine. The remaining 15% is made up essentially of \nalcohol, plus minute quantities of organic acids, sugars, minerals and tannins. \nTo analyze the minute quantities that might be considered nutritional in the wine would be a huge \nburden for the many small producers we represent. Each producer makes many different wines, some in \nvery small quantities; a separate analysis would have to be done for each individual wine, leading to a \nprohibitive burden in terms of both time and cost. This is time and money that most wineries simply do \nnot have. Additionally, the American consumer would not realty benefit from the nutritional information \n— if any— which would result from such analyses and labeling. \nIn conclusion: We already have so many regulations regarding labeling; adding this will just burden the \nindustry further, without really enlightening the American consumer. \nThank you for giving us the opportunity to share our thoughts. We hope you will give serious \nconsideration to our objections. \nSincerely, \nMordy Herzog, CEO \nRoyal Wine Corporation \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See Attached'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0090,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-09 15:34:41,,False,Comment 87:  Royal Wine Corp.,0900006486a8153e,2025-04-09 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,See Attached,m9a-2wid-o96u,,Comment(s),0,,,Bayonne,NJ,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-04-09 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:14,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,32,"[32, -1, -1]",32,-1,-1

Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated 2.6 million deaths per year were attributable to alcohol consumption and 2 million of alcohol attributable deaths were among men (World Health Organization,2024). Therefore, government and partners need to intensify actions in the following areas, increase awareness, strengthen prevention and treatment, train health professionals, implement SAFER package, increase efforts on capacity-building and knowledge transfer, engaged organizations/professional associations, improve monitoring systems and research, and increase resource for funding mechanisms to improve capacity of health and social systems (World Health Organization, 2024). \n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0An action by the government and partners to increase awareness is being executed by the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They are allowing additional time to submit comments about a proposed rule to include labels on wines, distilled spirits and malt liquors. Historically, alcoholic beverages were never regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These beverages are regulated by TTB and comprehensive labeling was not required. The TTB is responding to the Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 report on “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits,”. In the report, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the TTB renew their rulemaking on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. This is Notice No. 237. \xa0The information that TTB is proposing is the alcohol facts which includes calorie and nutrient content to consumers. Goldstein (2024) reported consumers need or want to know about the additives and ingredients in alcoholic beverages to avoid for health, safety, religious, or other reasons. Also, on certain types of beer and wine, TTB is proposing a statement of alcohol content because these certain beverages (malt beverages, beer, wine) are not required to have an alcohol content statement previously. To begin the improvements of the labeling, TTB published Notice No. 232.  This notice announced two virtual listening sessions which were February 28 and February 29, 2024. Basically, Notice No. 232 allowed input from the public on labeling of food allergens, and/or ingredients. The outcome of the two virtual listening sessions was 5,000 plus written comments received and 47 speakers were heard during the listening sessions.\xa0Since nine alcohol industry trade associations requested to extend the comment period, the original closing date of April 17, 2025, has been changed to August 15, 2025.\xa0\n\nBackground\n\n     Prior to the 2022 report by the Department of the Treasury, Notice No. 73 was published by the TTB on July 31, 2007. Notice no. 73 was entitled “Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits and Malt Beverages” in the Federal Register (72 FR 41860). But, TTB did not finalize the rulemaking.  The intentions of Notice 73 were to amend the TTB regulations which means there would be requirements for mandatory alcohol content labeling and mandatory calorie and nutrient information (“Serving Facts”) panel.  Plus, the “Serving Facts” would include the number of servings per container and serving size. \n\n     Since TTB did not finalize the rulemaking, on May 28, 2013, TTB published TTB Ruling 2013-2, Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. In this ruling, “Serving Facts” statement could be on a voluntary basis.  As a result, in the fall of 2017, TTB withdrew the “Serving Facts” rulemaking from the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Four years later, several consumer groups and public health advocates urged TTB to finalize the “Serving Facts” rulemaking in the “2021 CSPI letter”.  In other words, these consumer groups and public health advocates demanded a response. These consumer groups included the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Alcohol Justice, the American Institute for Cancer Research, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, the Consumer Federation of America, the National Consumers League, and the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.  Overall, the TTB is making progress and taking the necessary approaches in having appropriate information to be labeled for alcoholic beverages. \n\nCall to Action \n\n\xa0 Thirty percent of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States is due to overconsumption of alcohol (Goldstein, 2024). Not only are there traffic crash fatalities, but there are numerous health problems that are linked to the overconsumption of alcohol.

Street NW, Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \nRE: Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of \nWines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages - Request for 120-Day Extension for Comments  \n \nDear Ms. Greenberg, \n \nWine Institute is the public policy advocacy association representing over 1,000 California \nwineries and affiliated businesses.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the \nnation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of U.S. wine exports .  Distilled Spirits \nCouncil of the United States (“DISCUS”) is the principal trade association for the leading \nproducers and importers of distilled spirits products sold in the  U.S. and represents \ndistillers of all sizes .  The Beer Institute (“BI”) represents the $ 409.2 billion beer industry – \nan industry that includes over 6,600 brewers and more than 2.4 million American jobs.  BI is \na national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing both large and \nsmall brewers, as well as importers and industry suppliers.  The Brewers Association (“BA”) \nseeks to promote and protect the interests of craft brewers and the craft brewing \ncommunity, including beer consumers and home brewers. Today the BA  has roughly 5,000 \nfull voting brewery members – including members in every state – as well as over 1,000 allied \ntrade members and over 30,000 home brewer and beer enthusiast members.   The National \n \nPage 2 of 4 \n \nBeer Wholesalers Association’s (“NBWA”) purpose is to provide leadership, which \nenhances the independent beer and beverage distribution industry; to advocate before \ngovernment and the public; to encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol; and to \nprovide programs and services that will benefit its members.  Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of \nAmerica (“WSWA”) is the only national membership organization of wine and spirits \ndistributors.  On behalf of its more than 380 member companies, WSWA advocates on their \nbehalf with regards to federal, state, regulatory, and legal issues impacting distributors and \nthe beverage alcohol industry.   WineAmerica is the National Association of American \nWineries, representing wineries, winery associations, and wine industry supply companies \nacross the country.  WineAmerica’s mission is to encourage the dynamic growth and \ndevelopment of American wineries and winegrowing through the advancement and \nadvocacy of sound public policy.  The American Craft Spirits Association (“ACSA”) the only \nnational registered non-profit trade association representing the U.S. craft spirits industry. \nIts mission is to elevate and advocate for the community of craft spirits producers, and \nmembership in ACSA is open to anyone. American Distilled Spirits Alliance (“ADSA”) i s a \ntrade association comprised of 29 leading companies with common needs and interests in \nthe manufacturing, importation, and marketing of distilled spirits products in the U.S. and \naround the world.  ADSA member companies represent over 70 percent of all distilled spirit \nsales nationwide. \nWe refer to Wine Institute, DISCUS, BI, BA, NBWA, WSWA, WineAmerica, ACSA, and ADSA \ncollectively as “the Associations” in this joint letter.   \n \nThe Associations respectfully request an extension of the comment period in  Notice No. \n237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages \n(“Notice 237”).  The comment period for Notice 237 is scheduled to end on April 17, 2025. \nThe Associa tions request a 120-day extension to the current comment period that would \nextend to August 15, 2025. \n \nAs a threshold matter , we note that these rulemakings come at a time when heavily \nregulated industries, and the agencies that regulate them , are adjusting to the priorities of \nthe new administration .  There were many potentially impactful rulemakings published in \nthe final days of the previous administration and then a regulatory freeze put in place on the \nfirst day of the new administration.  Additional time will allow agencies, and the industries \nthey regulate, to better understand new priorities, expectations, and directives put into \nplace since Notice 237 issued.  This is particularly important for the thousands of small and \nmidsize wineries , c raft brewers, and craft distillers, who will bear great costs and \noperational burdens that a new and sweeping mandatory labeling regime imposes .  Even \nmeaningfully participating in  the comment process means they must redirect time and \nresources. \n \nNotice 237 is expansive—i.e., 53 pages in the Federal Registers’ 10-point, single -spaced \nfont—and poses more than 90 questions and expressly solicits comments in other areas.  It \nis also the first opportunity in a long while to comment on the important issues that it raises.  \nIndeed, it has been over 17 years since TTB last raised these issues and it rightly recognizes  \nPage 3 of 4 \n \nin Notice 237 that the comments received almost two decades ago “may no longer fully and \naccurately reflect the opinions ” of industry members, trade associations, and other \ninterested parties.  We agree with TTB that addressing this issue again years later necessarily \nrequires updated input  and add that the beverage alcohol landscape has fundamentally \nevolved over the past 17 years.   That said, it will take time to conduct a detailed analysis of \nthe proposed rule —including the many questions and requests fo r comments in Notice \n237—and for our members to provide comprehensive and useful feedback that will benefit \nthe overall process and TTB’s objectives with this rulemaking. \n \nIt is important to keep in mind that the  issues and questions addressed in Notice 237  will \nimpact small, midsize, and large industry members in different ways.  Given the importance \nof the issues, the Associations will need substantial time to collect, deliberate, and convey \nthe input of all our members to ensure their perspectives are included and well-reflected.  \nMoreover, TTB seeks comments in Notice 237 on important but sweeping areas of interest \nsuch as comments on “ any other options available to reduce regulatory burdens and \neconomic costs while still providing the consumer with adequate information about the \nproducts in question .”  Our members will need additional time to consider other options \navailable for those purposes and then explain and discuss them in submitted comments. \n \nLast, additional time is necessary due to several ongoing and overlapping rulemakings that \nimpact our members.  As you know, TTB also published a rulemaking proposing major food \nallergen labeling for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages on the same day as Notice \n237 and with the same deadline for comments.  One day prior to Notice 237’s publication , \nthe FDA published a rulemaking proposing front-of-package labeling for nutrition which will \nalso impact industry members.  All these rulemakings, including Notice 237, propose new \nrules with many potential impacts that de serve due consideration.  We therefore believe a \n120-day extension is appropriate and necessary. \n \nWe would be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have about this request. \n \n[ SIGNATURES ON FOLLOWING PAGE ] \n   \nPage 4 of 4 \n \n \n  \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n \n \nRobert P.

Therefore,  we  endorse  the  linear  label,  which  contains  all  the  information  required  by  the  TTB  while  also  allowing  for  listing  wine  attributes.

R. China on United States Notification\nG/TBT/N/USA/2182\n1. The draft regulation required all alcohol beverage labels regulated by TTB to\ndisclose the alcohol content, calories, and nutritional information of each beverage in\nthe ""alcohol content"" statement. Due to the fact that alcoholic beverages are mainly\ncomposed of ethanol and water, and do not contain conventional nutrients such as\nprotein, fat, carbohydrates, etc., for example, distilled spirits almost do not contain\nthese components. If the product does not add nutritional fortifiers or make nutritional\nclaims, labeling the nutritional content table is meaningless; Fermented alcoholic\nbeverages (such as beer and fruit wine) may contain small amounts of carbohydrates,\nand it may consider adding only labeled carbohydrates as appropriate. However, beer\nlabels also require labeling malt content, therefore, labeling carbohydrates is not very\nmeaningful for consumers. For ordinary consumers, the nutritional value of alcoholic\nbeverages is limited, and labeling indicators such as carbohydrates may be misleading\n(such as implying that they have nutritional supplementation functions). The\nadditional and unnecessary laboratory analysis costs incurred are also a heavy burden\nfor producers or traders.\nAccording to the relevant standards of the CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission),\nmost countries do not require the labeling of conventional nutrients such as protein,\nfat, carbohydrates, etc. for alcoholic beverages. The provision of Regulation (EU) No\n1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Provision of Food\nInformation to Consumers concerning the ingredient list and nutrition declaration for\nalcoholic beverages with an alcohol content exceeding 1.2% is non-mandatory. When\nthe nutrition statement for alcoholic beverages is voluntarily provided, it is limited to\nenergy values only.\nBased on the principle of scientific evidence and necessity, it is recommended that the\nUnited States should coordinate its requirements for alcoholic beverage labeling with\ninternational standards, or differentiated the requirements according to the different\nproduct forms of alcoholic beverages: consider not mandating the labeling of\nconventional nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc. on ordinary alcoholic\nbeverage labels as appropriate; If additional ingredients such as sugar, juice, or other\nnutritional enhancers are added to alcoholic beverages, the carbohydrate content or\nother nutrient content may be indicated according to the actual situation. To avoid\nexcessive regulation, reduce compliance costs for businesses, and alleviate the burden\non small and medium-sized enterprises.\n2. The draft regulation required the addition of new subpart L - alcohol factual\nstatements in Parts 4, 5, and 7 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\nThe current regulations require the display of information such as alcohol content,\ncarmine, sulfite, etc. The proposed rule required an addition of alcohol factual\nstatements such as single portion size, number of portions per container, and liquid\nounces per unit of pure ethanol, and the liquid ounce information per unit of pure\nethanol should be accurate to one tenth of the liquid ounce. The provision differs from\ninternational standards and may impose additional costs and burdens on alcoholic\nbeverage manufacturers and importers, especially small businesses. It is\nrecommended that the United States should maintain the current regulations without\n3 of 4adding the provision and not mandating the labeling of information such as ""single\nportion size, number of portions per container, and number of ounces of pure ethanol\nper serving"" to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade.\nComments in Chinese are as below:\n1、 规章修订提案中要求所有受TTB 监管的酒精饮料标签“酒精含量”声明\n中必须披露每份饮料的酒精含量、 卡路里及营养成分信息。 由于酒精饮料的主要\n成分为乙醇和水， 基本不含蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素，比如蒸馏\n酒几乎不含这些成分， 若产品未添加营养强化剂或未进行营养声称， 则标示营养\n成分表毫无意义；发酵酒（如啤酒、果酒）可能含有少量碳水化合物，可以酌情\n考虑仅添加标示碳水化合物， 但啤酒标签也已要求标注麦芽度， 因此标示碳水化\n合物对于消费者也无太大意义。对普通消费者而言，酒精饮料的营养价值有限，\n标注碳水化合物等指标可能产生误导（如暗示其具有营养补充功能） 。其产生额\n外的、不必要的实验室分析费用对生产商或贸易商来说也是繁重的负担。\n根据食品法典委员会的相关标准， 国际上绝大多数国家对酒精饮料不强制要\n求标注蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物等常规营养素。欧盟（EU）第 1169/2011 号条\n例《关于向消费者提供食品信息》涉及酒精含量超过 1.2%的酒精饮料提供成分\n清单、营养声明的规定属于非强制性条款，当酒精饮料营养声明是自愿提供时，\n营养声明仅限于能量值。\n本着科学性与必要性， 建议美方对酒精饮料标签的要求与国际标准协调一致，\n也可根据酒精饮料的不同产品形式区分要求： 酌情考虑不强制普通酒精饮料标签\n标注蛋白质、 脂肪、 碳水化合物等常规营养素； 若酒精饮料中额外添加了糖、果\n汁等配料， 或使用其他营养强化剂的， 可根据实际情况要求标示碳水化合物含量\n或其他营养素含量。以避免过度监管，降低企业合规成本与中小企业的负担。\n2、规章修订提案中要求在《美国联邦法规》第27 篇第 4、5、7 部分中分别\n增加新的子部分 L——酒精事实陈述条款。 现行法规已要求显示酒精含量、 胭脂\n红、 亚硫酸盐等信息， 该拟议规则要求增加单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯\n乙醇的液体盎司数等酒精事实声明， 且每份纯乙醇的液体盎司信息需精确到液体\n盎司的十分之一。 该条款与国际通行标准存在差异， 会给酒精饮料制造商和进口\n商， 特别是小企业带来额外的成本和负担。 建议美方维持现行法规， 不增加该条\n款， 不强制要求标示 “单份份量、 每个容器的份数和每份纯乙醇的液盎司数”等\n信息，以避免对贸易造成不必要的障碍。\n4 of 4'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'The attached comments are submitted (in English and in Chinese) on behalf of Jiao Yang, Deputy Director General of China&#39;s WTO/TBT National Notification &amp; Enquiry Center.<br/>'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0065,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-02 14:31:40,,False,Comment 64: People's Republic of China,0900006486a1e605,2025-03-24 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,"The attached comments are submitted (in English and in Chinese) on behalf of Jiao Yang, Deputy Director General of China&#39;s WTO/TBT National Notification &amp; Enquiry Center.<br/>",m8j-866j-4ly2,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,People's Republic of China - WTO/TBT National Notification & Enquiry Center,,,2025-03-21 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:04:24,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,28,"[28, -1, -1]",28,-1,-1

TTB–2025–0002 and TTB–2025–0003). \nThis issue is especially meaningful to me on a personal level. Over the past three years, I have \nundergone a major transformation in my health and lifestyle, losing over 100 pounds through \ndeliberate choices and a commitment to understanding the nutritional content of what I consume. \nAfter years of struggling with my weight and related health issues, I’ve learned ﬁrsthand how crucial \ntransparent labeling is in making informed, health-conscious decisions. \nAlcohol is often part of our culture, tied to celebrations and social occasions. I do not want to avoid \nthese moments; I simply want to be able to make informed decisions when I participate in them. \nUnfortunately, unlike nearly every other consumable product, alcohol is not required to disclose \nbasic information such as calories, ingredients, or allergens. This lack of transparency is unfair, \noutdated, and out of step with consumer expectations and health needs. \nI strongly urge the TTB to move forward with ﬁnalizing these proposals and to require full ingredient, \nnutrition, and allergen labeling on all alcoholic beverages for several key reasons: \n1. Empowering Health-Conscious Consumers – People like me who are managing their \nhealth need accurate nutritional information to make intentional choices. This information \nis essential—not optional—for supporting long-term health. \n2. Consumer Right to Know – It is only reasonable that consumers be given the same level of \ntransparency for alcohol as is provided for food, soda, or even bottled water. We deserve to \nknow what’s in the products we consume. \n3.

Importantly, this regulation is at the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) stage \nwhich invites public comments prior to finalization.1 As a student studying public health policy, I \nrealize that this phase is a vital opportunity for stakeholders, public, researchers and \nprofessionals to shape regulations that directly impact the health and lives of people.1 Public \ncommenting is not just a democratic mechanism but it is a critical tool that aligns regulatory \nactions with evidence and equity.\nHealth Risks of Alcohol Consumption:\nRoad traffic accidents are a pressing public health issue in the US with 32 people dying of \nautomobile crashes each year involving alcohol impaired driving accounting for 1 death in every \n45 minutes.2 According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), driving \nunder influence deaths were highest among young individuals aged 21 to 24 yrs (29%) and 25-34 \nyrs (28%).3 Excessive consumption of alcohol causes 178,000 deaths each year in the US, and \nleads to chronic heart and liver diseases, stroke, digestive issues, cancer and weakened immune \nsystem.4,5 It also has caused shorter life span leading individuals to die by an average of 24 \nyears.4 Effective regulations like TTB-2025-0002 can help reduce deaths by making people \nchoose to limit their alcohol consumption.4 \nEvidence-Based Impact of Labelling Alcoholic Beverages:\nAccording to Vasiljevic, M. et al. (2018), a randomized controlled trial found that when \nalcoholic beverages are labeled with clear information about Alcohol by Volume (ABV), and \namount of pure alcohol content per serving, individuals aged 18-40 years, social and non-\ndependent drinkers are significantly less likely to select high strength drinks.6 These finds show \nthat quantitative labels of alcoholic drinks reduces the appeal to strong alcoholic beverages \nespecially among individuals with low literacy levels about the risks of alcohol consumption, and \ngroups that are at an elevated risk of binge drinking and impaired driving.6 Another study done by Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), conducted a national survey with an aim to \nreceive consumer’s opinion about transparency in labeling alcoholic beverages with information \nsuch as calories, serving size, nutritional content, and alcohol content, that are a part of the \nregulation, TTB-2025-0002, along with other alcohol facts.7 The sample for the survey was \nnationally representative with US adults from all demographics.7 This study found that 63% to \n77% respondents supported policies that required the inclusion of nutrition and alcohol content \ninformation on the labels of alcoholic beverages, either somewhat or strongly.7 Whereas, 72% to \n90% respondents supported having more information on the labels as it would impact their \nchoice to purchase alcohol.7 A systematic review done in the UK also shows moderate evidence \nof labeling calories and ABV on purchasing choices of consumers showing increased preference \nfor alcoholic beverages with calorie count labels, and reduction in purchase of high calorie \nalcohol.8 While there is not much research done on evaluating the direct impact of labeling on \n“Driving While Intoxicated” (DWI) and alcohol related health issues among people in the US, \nthe above evidence-based research shows the psychological impact of labelling on consumers \npurchasing and alcoholic beverage choices based on content, that in turn suggests an increase in \nconsumer awareness about alcohol risks and a reduction in driving under influence and health \nissue prevalence due to alcohol consumption.6,7,8 While labeling alcoholic beverages alone \ncannot eliminate the issue of impaired driving, it can be a valuable evidence-informed strategy to \ncomplement other policy tools such as age limits, taxes and enforcement to help people make \ninformed health choices.9\nAddressing Health Equity:\nStandardized “Alcohol Facts” panel on labels of alcoholic beverages would be an equitable and \nlow cost strategy in bridging information gap.10 Rural and low-income communities often lack \naccess to resources and education.11 Labeling helps people from all socioeconomic and \neducational backgrounds stay informed about alcohol risks through clear information on labels of \nalcoholic beverages.12 If standardized labels are not clearly presented, it would perpetuate lack of \naccess to resources and education about alcohol risks among communities causing them to face \nalcohol-related health issues.\nRecommendations:\nIntegrating linguistic competency in the labels would help communities who don’t have literacy \nin English understand the information on the labels. Having alcohol facts panels on labels in \ndifferent commonly spoken languages in the US would help people understand it and make \ninformed health choices.\nConclusion:\nI commend the proposed regulation, TTB-2025-0002, as it supports evidence based strategies. \nThe nation has witnessed horrifying incidences such as the case of Jacqueline Saburido, who had \nto suffer from third degree burns due to her car being hit by a heavily intoxicated.13 The people \nof our country must never have to go through such experiences. TTB-2025-0002 can make this \nhappen. Therefore, I request the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to immediately \nfinalize and implement the regulation to protect the lives and health of all communities in the \nUnited States.1 TTB-2025-0002 ensures equity, helps alcohol risk communication and reduces \nalcohol-related harm.1References\n1.

Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \nRe: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages \n(Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) \n \nTo Whom it May Concern, \n \nThe American Society for Nutrition (ASN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on Alcohol \nFacts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. Founded in \n1928, ASN is the nation’s leading society for nutrition research and practice, representing more \nthan 8,000 professional members across 100 countries. Our members – including nutrition \nscientists, physicians, dietitians, and other stakeholders – are dedicated to advancing our mission \nof “A Healthier World Through Evidence-Based Nutrition.” ASN supports the Alcohol and \nTobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) efforts to implement labeling of alcohol content and \nnutritional information on alcoholic beverages, as this will impart important information to \nconsumers that they need to make informed health and nutrition-related purchases and decisions. \n \nThe “Alcohol Facts” panel in the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a \npercentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the \nnumber of calories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.” \nThis information is important to promote transparency regarding the contents of alcoholic \nbeverages, and to highlight health and safety information for those who consume alcohol. \nAlcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after \ntobacco and obesity, increasing risk for at least seven types of cancer\n1. Alcoholic beverages can \nbe calorie-dense and therefore contribute to diet-related chronic diseases. On average, alcohol \naccounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.2 Many alcoholic beverages also contain \nadded sugars and other nutrients to limit. \n \nAs such, the proposed rule could be strengthened by also requiring additional nutritional content, \nincluding total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in \nmilligrams, and a percent Daily Value for each of these nutrients based on a 2,000-calorie diet. \n \n \n1 Alcohol and Cancer Risk 2025: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory. US Department of Health and Human \nServices, Office of the Surgeon General. January 3, 2025. \n2 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory \nCommittee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.   \n \nThe final rule should also require the number of standard drinks per container (instead of the \nproposed number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving), and the conversion between \nstandard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. TTB may also consider dual-column \nlabeling for certain alcoholic beverages for those that are customarily consumed in one sitting. \nThis label has two columns, one for listing the nutritional facts related to a single serving and one \nlisting the nutritional facts for the contents of the entire package. \n \nASN supports the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on \nalcoholic beverage packages and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a \nwebpage), as this would specifically disadvantage populations that may be less likely to utilize \ntechnology to gain this important health and safety information.  \n \nASN urges TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts \nrule to ensure that Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to \ndrink. To ensure timely consumer access to this important information, the final rule should \nadopt a shorter compliance period of 3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed. \n \nThank you in advance for your consideration of the American Society for Nutrition’s comments \non Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. \nPlease contact Sarah Ohlhorst, MS, RD, ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer \n(sohlhorst@nutrition.org; 240-428-3647) for more information. \n \nSincerely, \n \nJohn E.

In fact, as a non-alcoholic beverage researcher, I recently evaluated non-alcoholic beer labels and found that all of the sample evaluated included both alcohol by volume percentage and relevant terminology on their labels, suggesting that a new requirement to include both would not involve an overhaul of current labeling practices.<br/><br/>With regard to nutritional content, the Food and Drug Administration requires that soft drinks (e.g., sodas, juices) include nutritional content on their labels and, if the TTB proposal is approved, full-strength alcohol would follow suit. A question from the TTB is whether non-alcoholic beers should be exempt from the nutritional content requirement. There is no reason for non-alcoholic beers to be exempt from this &ndash; caloric content influences beverage purchasing decisions(4) and consumers have a right to nutritional information to make informed decisions. To offer a clinical perspective, as a clinical psychologist, I have provided therapy for a client who had alcohol use disorder and who found value in using non-alcoholic beers to support abstinence from alcohol use, yet the client also had concern about carbohydrate intake due to co-occurring diabetes. Nutritional content on non-alcoholic beers would support awareness of carbohydrate content, with potential to shape health behavior. Further, in my assessment of  non-alcoholic beers, the majority assessed included calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content on their labels, indicating that most producers would be amenable to a new nutritional content requirement.<br/><br/>Also worth comment and absent from the TTB proposal is consumer communication about who should avoid non-alcoholic beers (and other non-alcoholic beverages that mirror alcohol). Certain kombucha companies voluntarily include on their label a warning against consumption for people avoiding alcohol (e.g., due to pregnancy, sensitivities), as the fermentation process can yield up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. A similar warning on non-alcoholic beers may be worthwhile. While non-alcoholic beers can be a helpful substitute for some,(5) their alcohol cues may activate craving for full-strength alcohol.(6) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included the mandated government health warning for alcohol. Arguably, a consumer communication that is tailored to the specific (non-alcoholic) product would be more relevant and informative than simply using the warning required for full-strength alcohol. Another consideration is whether minors should be permitted to consume non-alcoholic beers(7,8) &ndash; labels that clearly note to avoid consumption if avoiding alcohol may guide parent considerations about providing non-alcoholic beers to their children.(9) A minority of non-alcoholic beer labels I evaluated included an age-restriction. As federal and state regulations evolve regarding at what age non-alcoholic beers can be purchased, relevant labeling will need to track.<br/><br/>At present non-alcoholic beer labeling is largely self-regulated. I appreciate the opportunity to offer comment, informed by both my research and clinical experiences, to support effective labeling strategies of non-alcoholic beers.<br/><br/>References<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>NielsenIQ.

(CIVYL), \nthe united voice of eleven leading companies dedicated to the production, packaging, and importation of \nwines and liquors in Mexico: Bacardi, Beam Suntory, BLN, Brown-Forman Casa Herradura, Casa \nCuervo, Campari, Diageo, Pedro Domecq, La Madrileña-Bepensa, Moët Hennessy, and Pernod \nRicard. CIVYL’s mission is to contribute effectively and timely to the development and implementation \nof public policies related to alcoholic beverages. \nFirstly, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this process and \ncontribute to the development of regulations that benefit both the industry and consumers. CIVYL is \ndedicated to promoting responsible and transparent practices in the production and marketing of \nalcoholic beverages, and we value the importance of maintaining updated regulations that accurately \ninform consumers without causing confusion. \nIn this regard, we would like to express our concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Code \nof Federal Regulations under Notice No. 237, which would mandate the inclusion of an ""Alcohol \nFacts"" panel on the labeling of alcoholic beverages. \nWe understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect consumers. However, we believe \nthat requiring the inclusion of nutritional information on labeling may not provide significant benefits to \nconsumers as the primary objective of alcoholic beverage labeling, from a public health perspective, is to \npromote responsible alcohol consumption and prevent harmful alcohol use. Including nutritional \ninformation on these beverages may create the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" \npotentially leading to consumer confusion. \nAlcohol should not be considered a product that provides nutrients to the consumer. Including \nnutritional information on labels could mislead consumers into believing that alcoholic beverages are part \nof a balanced diet or provide essential nutrients. This could influence purchasing decisions in a way that \ndiverts attention from critical aspects such as alcohol content. Additionally, comparing the \nnutritional values of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages may be misleading, as their \ncharacteristics and intended purposes are fundamentally different. Factors such as caloric content, \ncarbohydrates, sugars, or fats in alcoholic beverages should not be equated with those of conventional \nfoods, given that alcohol itself is the primary differentiating component. In Mexico, legislation prohibits \nalcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits, as well as therapeutic, curative, or \nrehabilitative properties. \nIn Mexico, according to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising for these products must be \nlimited to informing them about their characteristics, quality, and production techniques, without \npresenting them as sources of well-being or health. Furthermore, Article 307 states that the advertising \nof food and non-alcoholic beverages should not be directly or indirectly associated with the consumption \nof alcoholic beverages nor induce harmful eating habits. Lastly, Article 6 of the General Health Law \nRegulations on Advertising establishes that product advertising must not attribute preventive, \ntherapeutic, rehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or other qualities to them. This reinforces the \nprohibition of attributing nutritional value or properties that do not correspond to alcoholic beverages. \nRather than being useful, these statements could directly cause consumer confusion. \n \n \n \n  \nFurthermore, implementing this measure would represent an additional cost for manufacturers, \nimporters, and distributors of alcoholic beverages. This would contravene Article 2.2 of the WTO \nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which prohibits imposing technical regulations that \ncreate unnecessary obstacles to international trade without a justification based on legitimate \nobjectives of member states. We understand the inclusion of alcohol content as a measure to protect \nconsumers. However, we believe that the labeling requirement should be limited to declaring only the \nalcohol content. \nConsidering all the above, we respectfully request that the implementation of this modification \nregarding the inclusion of the “Alcohol Facts” panel be reconsidered, as it may not provide \nsignificant additional benefits to consumers and could, instead, lead to unintended confusion \nregarding the nature and nutritional value of alcoholic beverages and it must be limited to \ndeclaring only the alcohol content. Additionally, increasing regulatory and financial burdens on \nproducers, in particular small and medium-sized ones. \nHowever, if the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel is approved, it is recommended that the \ninformation should be allowed to be presented through electronic labeling (QR code, digital platform, or \nwebsite). This approach would facilitate access to information without imposing unnecessary regulatory \nor commercial burdens. \nThis tool offers the following advantages: \n• Unlimited information space for consumers. \n• Provides consumers with more information in a user-friendly and easily understandable \nformat.  \n• Easily accommodates changes in regulatory provisions. \n• Allows information to reach one of the most vulnerable groups (young people) to prevent \nexcessive and harmful alcohol use.  \n \nThe above is consistent with the "" Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food Information \nin Food Labelling”, which is being developed within the framework of the Codex Alimentarius Labeling \nCommittee. \nFinally, if this requirement is implemented, a gradual implementation period of five years would be the \nbest way to adopt such measures, allowing small producers to modify their supply chain for distribution \nin the U.S. \nFor these reasons, we urge TTB to reconsider the proposed amendments and explore alternative, less \nburdensome solutions. \nSincerely, \n \n \nPanambí Garcés \nGeneral Manager \n \n \n \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0073,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-02 17:54:51,,False,"Comment 71:  Comisión para la Industria de Vinos y Licores, A.C.

I offer these comments as a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to specific requests for comment.\n\n\n\nTitle of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”\n\nWhich title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?\n\nAre consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?\n\nAlternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?\n\n\n\nIn many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts and dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to as “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is presented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the term “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol Facts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by seeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on a non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently providing alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. \n\n\n\nMandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information\n\nShould TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?\n\nFor greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?\n\nWould the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?\n\nShould TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?\n\nDo consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? \n\n\nSome aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include calories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily value for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars or other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to allow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for calories, fat, etc. \n\nI think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks cited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense balance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently giving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  \n\nFrom personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving of alcohol and what constitutes a serving. Having alcohol facts available is useful in making choices to maintain healthy weights and consume responsibly. \n\nCalculating Panel Elements & Tolerance Levels\n\nTTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still specific enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Specifically, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set.\n\nTTB should be mindful of tolerances that are so exact that it would cause undue financial burden to small operations to comply with little benefit to public health. I agree with the approach TTB is proposing.\n\nMandatory Listing of Alcohol Content by volume on Malt Beverages\n\nShould TTB require alcohol content statement on a beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act, but is subject to the IRC? \n\nShould TTB increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the statement amount for all malt beverage and beers? This would alleviate the need for expensive specialized equipment needed to test for alcohol content to a sufficient degree of certainty to meet the current tolerance standards. Would consumers receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance is increased? \n\nShould TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as the statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume?\n\nYes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements on beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act. Most consumers do not understand the regulatory distinction, so not seeing alcohol content on some products would be confusing and implementing the requirements “across the board” provides parity among producers. \n\nOn the matter of increasing labeling tolerances, as long as the tolerance is backed with evidence that shows that consumers would not suffer harm if the alcohol content was one percentage point higher than what is stated on a product, I support the proposal. A proposal that would require purchase of expensive equipment to test alcohol content for certainty if there is no public health reason makes no sense and only serves to reduce competition in the marketplace. \n\nI agree with TTB’s proposal to require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages and a statement that adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume. \n\nPlacement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of Alcohol Facts Statement\n\nWould it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?\n\nAlternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?\n\n\n\nAs a consumer, I do not feel strongly as to whether the alcohol content information is located on the Alcohol Facts statement or elsewhere on the label. However, I believe there should be a designated place where the information is required with options to provide it elsewhere (in addition) if a producer would like to include it as part of the label elsewhere. I think since the labels are changing so drastically, consumers should get used to finding important information in one spot on the container. By allowing the option to provide the information in more than one place, if producers have front of container labels that contain ABV, they would not need to redesign and reprint those labels in addition to having to comply with Alcohol Facts and/or allergen labeling requirements. \n\n\n\nMandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving\n\nTTB proposes to amend the regulations to require the listing of the number of U.S. fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, expressed to the nearest tenth of a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the information would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume statement.\n\nWould including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?\n\nIs there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?\n\nTTB notes that the\xa0Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025,\xa0use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.\n\nShould the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the\xa0Dietary Guidelines'\xa0advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?\n\nTTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide useful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and whether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and regulatory burdens.\n\nThe public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that many consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts. When thinking about adding alcohol facts and possibly ingredients and allergens to a label on an alcohol beverage container, there are a couple of considerations. First, can all of the required information reasonably fit on the containers and second, will consumers be overwhelmed with information, such that the information becomes useless to them. This proposal may be one to consider in the future while education and outreach efforts are made to help consumers understand the concepts and how they relate to alcohol by volume. \n\n\n\nLinear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\nLinear Display\n\nThough this may be more difficult for some consumers to read, allowing this as an option may be reasonable for certain containers. \n\nType Size\n\nUnless there is a good reason why type size should be limited, TTB should allow for flexibility and innovative marketing and label design where reasonable. \n\nElectronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\nWhile it is understandable for business owners to desire less costly ways to meet regulatory requirements, allowing mandatory disclosure information online in lieu of on a physical label does create a disadvantage for those with limited access to internet or computers, generally. I reside in Alaska. In some communities, all cell providers do not have coverage in all parts of the state. Some people are uncomfortable utilizing QR codes and others have limited data plans. We are just not yet at a point where we can rely exclusively on electronic means to convey important information to consumers. \n\nDual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display\n\nDoes dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?\n\nShould dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than five servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?\n\nThese are difficult questions. On one hand, FDA implemented dual-column nutrition facts panels because some products appeared to contain one serving when they contained two or even three or more servings, leading consumers to overindulge. In the case of alcohol beverages, the caloric content is less important than the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One could make a case either way as to whether providing whole container alcohol facts might imply a recommendation or expectation of consumption of multiple servings. There almost needs to be more of a warning statement as opposed to a facts statement to draw to a consumer’s attention that consumption of the entire drink may lead to overconsumption that they may not have intended. \n\nOnce again, thank you for the opportunity to express my overall support of this project to provide consumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of alcohol beverages. \n\nKimberly Stryker""}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0123/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': ""Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt \nBeverages\nDocket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237] \nRIN 1513-AC93\nDear Reviewer,\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed mandatory alcohol facts \nstatement labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. I offer these comments \nas a consumer. I am supportive of the proposal and offer the following in response to \nspecific requests for comment.\nTitle of Alcohol Beverage Information Statement – “Alcohol Facts”\n1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to \nconsumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information \nprovided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol \ncontent information?\n2. Are consumers accustomed to finding nutrient content information in a \nServing Facts statement? Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause \nconfusion?\n3. Alternatively, does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to \nreadily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?\nIn many ways, the answer relates to TTB’s decisions on serving size reference amounts \nand dual-column alcohol facts panel display proposals. If the entire panel is referred to \nas “Alcohol Facts” and then serving size reference amounts and a dual column is \npresented with facts about the entire container, that wording makes sense. Use of the \nterm “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” would already distinguish alcohol beverages \nfrom other food items, where “Nutrition Facts” is the title of the panel, but “Alcohol \nFacts” provides more distinction.  I do not believe consumers would be confused by \nseeing “Alcohol Facts” on a container of an alcohol beverage versus “Nutrition Facts” on \na non-alcohol beverage, especially since many alcohol beverages are not currently \nproviding alcohol fact labeling. There is already an expectation that labeling is different. \nMandatory Calorie & Nutrient Information\n1. Should TTB's proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent \nwith the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA's labeling \njurisdiction? Alternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and \nother foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient \nlabeling required on food labels that are under FDA's labeling jurisdiction? For \nexample, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed \nnutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers? \nAlternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they \nmay rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient \nrequirements?2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts \nstatements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and \ncholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?\n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol \nbeverages (such as trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading?\n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of \nalcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could \nsuch a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol \nbeverage has nutritional value or other health-related benefits?\n5. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? \nHow might consumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate \ninformation about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol \nbeverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? \nSome aspects of Alcohol Facts labeling make sense for consumers. Those elements include \ncalories, fat, carbohydrates (including sugar), sodium, and protein. Providing percent of daily \nvalue for alcohol beverages should be no different than providing the information on candy bars \nor other foods that are no source of nutrition for consumers. The purpose of the percentages is to \nallow a consumer to factor in how their choices affect their recommended daily maximum for \ncalories, fat, etc. \nI think there is little to no value in including vitamins and minerals. Given the public health risks \ncited by different groups during previous public comment periods, there must be a commonsense \nbalance between disclosing information to assist consumers in making choices and inadvertently \ngiving the impression that alcohol beverages provide a source of nutrition.  \nFrom personal experience, I believe few consumers know how many calories are in each serving \nof alcohol and what constitutes a serving. Having alcohol facts available is useful in making \nchoices to maintain healthy weights and consume responsibly. \nCalculating Panel Elements & Tolerance Levels\nTTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to \nfacilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for \ncalculating calorie and nutrient content, but still specific enough to provide \naccurate information to consumers. Specifically, TTB seeks comments on \nwhether it should instead propose the same tolerances set.\nTTB should be mindful of tolerances that are so exact that it would cause undue financial burden \nto small operations to comply with little benefit to public health. I agree with the approach TTB \nis proposing.\nMandatory Listing of Alcohol Content by volume on Malt Beverages\n1. Should TTB require alcohol content statement on a beer that is not a “malt \nbeverage” under the FAA Act, but is subject to the IRC? 2. Should TTB increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or \nbelow the statement amount for all malt beverage and beers? This would alleviate \nthe need for expensive specialized equipment needed to test for alcohol content to \na sufficient degree of certainty to meet the current tolerance standards. Would \nconsumers receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt \nbeverages if the tolerance is increased? \n3. Should TTB require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt beverages, \nbut not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by volume as long as \nthe statement adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less than \n0.5% alcohol by volume?\nYes, I believe TTB should use its authority under the IRC to require alcohol content statements \non beer that is not a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act. Most consumers do not understand the \nregulatory distinction, so not seeing alcohol content on some products would be confusing and \nimplementing the requirements “across the board” provides parity among producers. \nOn the matter of increasing labeling tolerances, as long as the tolerance is backed with evidence \nthat shows that consumers would not suffer harm if the alcohol content was one percentage point \nhigher than what is stated on a product, I support the proposal. A proposal that would require \npurchase of expensive equipment to test alcohol content for certainty if there is no public health \nreason makes no sense and only serves to reduce competition in the marketplace. \nI agree with TTB’s proposal to require an Alcohol Facts statement for non-alcoholic malt \nbeverages and a statement that adequately informs the consumer that the product contains less \nthan 0.5% alcohol by volume, but not require a specific statement of percentage of alcohol by \nvolume. \nPlacement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of Alcohol Facts Statement\n1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label \nif it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?\n2. Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element \nof the Alcohol Facts statement?\nAs a consumer, I do not feel strongly as to whether the alcohol content information is located on \nthe Alcohol Facts statement or elsewhere on the label. However, I believe there should be a \ndesignated place where the information is required with options to provide it elsewhere (in \naddition) if a producer would like to include it as part of the label elsewhere. I think since the \nlabels are changing so drastically, consumers should get used to finding important information in \none spot on the container. By allowing the option to provide the information in more than one \nplace, if producers have front of container labels that contain ABV, they would not need to \nredesign and reprint those labels in addition to having to comply with Alcohol Facts and/or \nallergen labeling requirements. \nMandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving1. TTB proposes to amend the regulations to require the listing of the number of \nU.S. fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, expressed to the nearest tenth \nof a fluid ounce, on the mandatory Alcohol Facts statement. In a panel, the \ninformation would be required to be indented under the alcohol-by-volume \nstatement.\n2. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per \nserving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers \nto follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and \nhealth agencies, if they so choose?\n3. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? \nSpecifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or \nin addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?\n4. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms \n“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of \nthose terms should be used or defined for use on labels.\n5. Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of \nthe Dietary Guidelines' advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any \nchanges in the guidelines over time)?\n6. TTB also specifically seeks comments on whether these proposals would provide \nuseful information to consumers or would instead be confusing or misleading, and \nwhether inclusion of these elements would affect the costs of compliance and \nregulatory burdens.\nThe public health reasoning behind this proposal is strong; however, I am not confident that \nmany consumers would understand the significance without some sort of outreach efforts.

The proposed \nlabel would require the disclosure of per-serving alcohol content, calorie count, and nutrient \ninformation. This action is long overdue and urgently needed, as it represents an important step \ntoward improving public health, enhancing consumer transparency, and encouraging more \ninformed and responsible alcoholic consumption. I respectfully urge the TTB to adopt this rule \nand to maintain the proposed five-year compliance period as it is both practical and reasonable \nfor industry application. \nThere are several compelling reasons as to why mandatory alcohol facts labeling should be \nimplemented. \n1. Enhancing Consumer Protection by Implementing Beverage Transparency  \nOne of the most important public health justifications for this rule is the urgent \nneed for transparency regarding the composition and nutrition of alcoholic beverages. \nUnlike packages foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \nalcoholic beverages regulated by the TTB are not currently required to include nutrition \nlabels. While the reasoning for this stems from decisions made in the 1930s, these \npolicies are outdated and no longer align with modern consumer expectations or health \npriorities.1  \nThe absence of transparency means that consumers continue to be unaware of \ningredients that could pose health risks, especially for those with allergies and dietary \nrestrictions. Many people are unaware that alcoholic beverages can contain sulfites, \nartificial colors, sweeteners, preservatives, or grains that may cause adverse reactions.2 A \nproduct that was once safe to consume may change formulations without the consumer’s \nknowledge. This lack of labeling creates unnecessary risk for individuals with food \nsensitivities or health conditions. While this proposed rule does not address allergen \ndisclosure, like that of Docket No. TTB-2025-0003,3 it lays the foundation for consumer \ntransparency among alcoholic beverages. Additionally, this rule supports health equity by \n \n1 admin-bluelabel, “Beer, Wine, Spirits Labels: Ingredients Labeling & Serving Facts,” Blue Label Packaging, \nFebruary 22, 2019, https://www.bluelabelpackaging.com/blog/why-dont-beer-wine-and-spirits-labels-have-to-\ndisclose-ingredients-or-serving-facts-on-labels/. \n2 “Alcohol Intolerance-Alcohol Intolerance - Symptoms & Causes,” Mayo Clinic, accessed April 21, 2025, \nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-intolerance/symptoms-causes/syc-20369211. \n3 “Major Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages,” Federal Register, January 17, \n2025, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00955/major-food-allergen-labeling-for-wines-\ndistilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages. making it easier for people with chronic conditions and dietary needs to make safe and \ninformed choices.  \n2. Promoting Nutritional Awareness \nAlcoholic beverages are a significant source of “hidden” calories. Without \nlabeling, many individuals unknowingly exceed their recommended daily intake for \ncalories or sugar through alcohol consumption alone. For example, a 1.5 ounce shot of \nhard liquor contains anywhere from 100 to 120 calories and that is before any mixers are \nadded.4  \nRequiring calorie and nutrient content labeling would encourage consumers to \nbetter track their intake and make more intentional decisions that correspond to their \nhealth goals. In a society that is increasingly focused on improving their health and \npreventing disease, transparency among consumed alcohol is essential. Emerging studies \nhave revealed an association between alcohol consumption and obesity.5 Thus, \ntransparency in labeling can contribute to nutritional awareness among consumers and \nsupport more conscious drinking habits. \n3. Reducing Risky Consumption and Binge Drinking Through Informed Choices \nTransparent alcohol labeling also plays a critical role in preventing \noverconsumption and binge drinking. According to the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), binge drinking is defined as consuming five or more \ndrinks for males or four or more for females within a two-hour period.6 However, without \nclear labeling of alcohol content and serving size, many individuals underestimate the \namount of alcohol within a beverage, particularly with ready to drink cocktails or \noversized containers. \nStudies have shown that alcohol labeling can influence drinking behavior and \nreduce the intentions to drink alcohol.7 More accurate labeling could encourage \nmoderation and promote responsible drinking habits, especially among casual drinkers or \nyounger consumers who may not be aware of the recommended limits. By implementing \na label, consumers would be able to gauge how much they are actually consuming, which \ncould potentially reduce binge drinking. \nThe proposed alcohol facts labeling rule is a critical step towards improving consumer \ntransparency, health equity, and public safety. This change would bring the labeling standard of \nalcoholic beverages to that of the same caliber of the labeling for food and non-alcoholic \nbeverages, thus allowing consumers to make informed decisions regarding their health. This rule \nalso fosters accountability and transparency.

The objectives of \nBNIC are to develop and promote Cognac, to facilitate market access and to defend the best interests of all \nCognac stakeholders overall. \n \nOn 17th January 2025, the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) published in \nthe Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring the disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, \nand nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to \nTTB’s regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.  \n \nOn TTB’s request for comments regarding the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” or “Serving Facts” \n(both are currently being considered by the TTB): \nBNIC is favorable for the use of the title “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”. Indeed, the \ninformation included in the proposal refers to nutritional information in a serving of an alcoholic beverage \nwhich will be specific to the beverage in quest ion, rather than information on alcohol. Therefore, the title \n“Alcohol Facts” could be misleading or a cause of confusion for consumers.  \n \nOn TTB’s display proposals: \nLabeling space is limited and in efforts to reduce the ecological impacts of labeling (printing, use of ink etc.) \nit is desirable to limit the information which is printed out. Therefore,   \n- BNIC s trongly u rges the TTB to authorize the use of digital means to display the nutritional \nstatement. Authorizing the use of digital tools would present many advantages. Firstly, this would \nsave space on the label itself, reducing the use of paper, glue and ink to print the labels. Secondly, \nit would allow industry members to share further information with consumers about the product, \ni.e. the production process, list of ingredients, health and responsible consumption guidelines,  \nBUREAU NATIONAL INTERPROFESSIONNEL DU COGNAC \n23, Allées Bernard Guionnet • BP 90018 • 16101 Cognac Cedex France  \nT : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr \npackaging collection and sorting details and sustainability information. Digital tools such as QR \ncodes also allow for the information to be easily shared in different languages, allowing a greater \nnumber of consumers to understand and have readily access to information on the product. Finally, \ndigital tools also for easy updates, low compliance costs and avoid label waste which allows \nbusinesses to update their labels with minimal cost incurred. In the European Union, the wine \nindustry must only include the number of calories per 100ml on the bottle, with further information \nsuch as energy values and the list of ingredients being readily available via a QR Code in all 24 \nofficial languages of the European Union. This is very important for the alcoholic beverages sector \nwhich is made up of largely exported products.   \n- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly urges the TTB to remove the black box around the \ndeclaration which will unnecessarily use up space on the label. Removing the black box will allow \nindustry members more flexibility on the presentation of the required information.  \n- In the case of physical labeling, BNIC strongly u rges the TTB to authorize a linear display on all \nbottles, regardless of their content. A linear display, rather than a columned table display, will allow \nindustry members to save space on their labels and offer them more flexibility in the declaration \npresentation.   \n \nOn TTB’s proposal regarding the information to be included in the declaration:  \n- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to allow sugar content statements to remain as an optional \nelement. This flexibility will allow industry members the possibility to align as much as possible \nwith international practices regarding this matter. For example, in E urope, many spirit industry \nmembers voluntarily disclose additional nutritional information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, \nprotein and salt.  \n- BNIC asks for the removal of the Alcohol by volume from the declaration. Firstly, the alcohol by \nvolume percentage is already presented on the front label, in the same field of vision as the \nCommercial name and the Legal name of the product. Repeating the alcohol by volume percentage \nwill not share any further information with the consumer as this information is already easily \navailable on the front label. However, it would take up more room unnecessarily for industry \nmembers.  \n- BNIC would like to inform TTB that the expression of alcohol in fluid ounces may lead to \nconfusion among consumers. Fluid ounces are not commonly used in other countries, particularly \nforeign speaking countries. We therefore recommend the option of using international standards \nsuch as ml or cl. \n- BNIC welcomes TTB’s proposal to not align the declaration on distilled spirits with the FDA \nNutrition Facts label. The inclusion of such information is unnecessary due to the differences \nbetween alcohol beverages and other foods, Cognac for example does not contain sodium.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposal regarding serving sizes:  \nBUREAU NATIONAL INTERPROFESSIONNEL DU COGNAC \n23, Allées Bernard Guionnet • BP 90018 • 16101 Cognac Cedex France  \nT : +33 (0)5 45 35 60 00 • F : +33 (0)5 45 82 86 54 • contact@bnic.fr • cognac.fr \n- BNIC recommends avoiding the use of nutritional information for the whole bottle as this could \nlead to consumer confusion who may believe the information relates to a serving size rather than \nthe whole bottle.  \n- BNIC would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes. Serving sizes may \nvary between different countries and may also differ depending on the specificity of the product. \nFor example, a typical serving size in France for a distilled spirit would be 30ml.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposal to permit a 20% tolerance above or below the labeled amount for calories, \ncarbohydrates, protein and fat: \nBNIC kindly welcomes and supports this proposal. Indeed, BNIC and Cognac industry members have \ncalculated average nutritional values for Cognac with an ABV of 40%. TTB’s current proposal would allow \nfor this average nutritional value to be used by our industry members and facilitate small and medium-sized \nbusinesses in implementing the new rule.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposed exclusion of requesting a new COLA request: \nBNIC kindly welcomes the proposed exemption from requesting a new COLA for industry members. This \nwill largely reduce the administrative burden for our industry members, particularly small and medium-sized \nbusinesses.  \n \nOn TTB’s proposed transition period:  \n- BNIC kindly welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic \nclimate for our industry, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for industry members.  \n- BNIC would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was \nput on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. As a premium product, Cognac stock \nturnover can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits, especially during the \ncurrent particularly difficult economic conjuncture of industry.  \n- BNIC would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238 : Major Food \nAllergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  is adopted, that its entry into \nforce is aligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.  \n '}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0099,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-04-16 13:30:34,,False,"Comment 96:  Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC),",0900006486a9540e,2025-04-16 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,See attached file(s),m9j-px6y-11r8,,Comment(s),0,,,Cognac,,,France,,,,,,,,2025-04-16 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:03:58,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,0,"[0, -1, -1]",0,-1,-1

Even in our required TIPS alcohol license certification, it does not recommend basing the intoxicated level of a person merely upon number of drinks consumed.  <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>I urge you to consider the potential economic and operational impacts of the proposed labeling requirements on Georgia&rsquo;s wine industry. By exploring alternative strategies for consumer education, we can achieve the goal of informed decision-making without placing undue burdens on small businesses that are vital to our state&rsquo;s economy and cultural heritage.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am committed to promoting responsible consumption and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that educate consumers while supporting the sustainability of the wine industry.<br/><br/>",m9x-38zc-f3j6,,Comment(s),0,,,Ringgold,GA,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-04-23 04:00:00,1,2025-06-24 22:03:31,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,-1,"[-1, 10, 38]",-1,10,38

1,"[{'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0003/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': ' 1 \nComments on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  Docket No. TTB-2025-0002, Notice No. 237, RIN 1513-AC93  I appreciate the opportunity to offer my individual comments on the proposed rule regarding Alcohol Facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The intent and purpose of this rule are commendable, as it aims to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the alcohol content and nutritional value of these beverages. Such transparency is crucial for informed consumer choices and aligns with public health objectives. The general outline of the proposed rule is a significant step forward in enhancing label clarity and consumer awareness. However, I would like to offer a few specific comments and suggestions to further improve its implementation, effectiveness and fairness. Linear Display I believe that a linear display of the required information should not only be allowable but actually preferable. It is more cost-effective, efficient, informs consumers sufficiently, and requires less label real estate. Additionally, a linear display is less disruptive to the label\'s overall design, and avoids impairing the seller’s branding and presentation. Compliance Timeline I propose extending the compliance timeline to six years. Considering the industry standard of a five-year label turnover, a six-year period would better align with this cycle, significantly reducing the regulatory burden. This extension would enable producers to comply without incurring unnecessary costs or causing undue harm to the marketplace and consumers. Given the lengthy development of this rule, an abrupt compliance period shorter than the industry\'s label turnover timeframe would be impractical and ill-advised.    2 \nCategorization of Hard Ciders The rule would benefit from including a separate categorization of hard ciders due to their unique characteristics, rather than jamming them into a non-germane category. Hard ciders differ from other alcoholic beverages in alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. Alcohol Content: Hard ciders vary significantly in alcohol content, from low-alcohol variants to levels comparable to wine or beer. Clear guidelines based on alcohol content would help consumers make informed choices and enable producers to comply with specific requirements. Packaging Sizes: Hard ciders come in various packaging sizes, requiring different labeling considerations. A separate categorization would allow for tailored labeling requirements to accommodate diverse packaging options. Fermentation Variability: The fermentation process for hard ciders differs from that of other alcoholic beverages. Factors like apple type, fermentation duration, and additional ingredients impact the final product. Regulations that account for these variabilities would ensure consumers receive accurate product information. Nutritional Profiles: Hard ciders have distinct nutritional profiles, with varying levels of sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients. A separate categorization would allow for more accurate labeling, ensuring consumers understand the nutritional content. Therefore, I recommend that TTB establish a distinct category for hard ciders within the regulatory framework. One way to do this is by creating specific guidelines that address the unique aspects of hard ciders, including their alcohol content, packaging sizes, fermentation processes, and nutritional profiles. This approach would improve clarity and compliance, benefiting both consumers and producers. Lessened Requirements for 50 ml Minibottles I recommend lessened requirements for 50 ml minibottles of hard liquor/spirits due to the significant challenges posed by limited labeling space. Prioritizing essential information ensures readability and design integrity. Since minibottles are often sold in sets with comprehensive outer packaging, extensive individual labeling is unnecessary. Their small portion size presents a lower risk, justifying less stringent requirements. Lessened compliance for minibottles benefits consumers by keeping  3 \nlabels uncluttered and clear, streamlining regulatory processes, and reducing the burden on producers, especially small businesses.  I recommend implementing guidelines for minibottles that specify minimum required information, such as alcohol content and a general warning, to maintain essential disclosures while allowing flexibility. Other Issues § 7.63 Mandatory Label Information ""Mandatory label information"" should be capitalized for consistency with other section titles: ""Mandatory Label Information."" Examples in Figures In the linear display example for distilled spirits (§ 5.212): ""Serving Size 1.7 fl oz (50 mL)"" should read ""Serving Size 1.5 fl oz (44 mL)"" to maintain consistency with other serving sizes. Rounding Rules The rules for rounding percentages and numerical values (such as alcohol content and nutritional information) should be explicitly stated to ensure consistency. For instance, specifying how to handle rounding for values like 14.95% alcohol by volume would provide clarity and avoid discrepancies. I suggest stating: ""All percentages and numerical values should be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percent (0.1%) for clarity and consistency."" Optional Information The conditions for including optional information, such as additional statements of alcohol content or total sugars, should be clearly defined. This clarity would help prevent inconsistent labeling practices and ensure uniform presentation of all necessary information.    4 \nLabeling for Small Containers The labeling requirements for very small containers, where space is limited, need clarification. Specifying minimum font sizes and prioritizing information can help producers comply without compromising readability.  I suggest: “For containers smaller than 50 ml, the minimum font size for mandatory information should be 1.0 mm. Priority should be given to listing alcohol content, serving size, and allergens.” Definitions of Terms Terms like ""non-alcoholic,"" ""alcohol free,"" and ""low alcohol"" might be interpreted differently by consumers. Providing clear definitions and consistent usage in the regulations would help prevent ambiguity and ensure consumer understanding. One way to do this would be: ""Non-alcoholic: Contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Alcohol free: Contains 0.0% alcohol by volume. Low alcohol: Contains less than 1.2% alcohol by volume."" Scope of Mandatory Information Clarify what is considered mandatory versus optional information within the Alcohol Facts statement to avoid confusion. Clear distinctions between mandatory and optional information will help ensure consistent labeling practices across the industry. I suggest: ""Mandatory information includes alcohol content, serving size, and nutrient information. Optional information may include additional health claims or ingredient details, provided they are accurately labeled as optional."" Product Variability The rule should address products with variable compositions, such as cocktails with different fruit content that may absorb spirits. Providing guidance on labeling these products will help ensure consumers receive accurate information about their beverages.   5 \nA suggested guideline could be: “Products with variable compositions should list average alcohol content and nutrient information based on standard recipes. Any significant variations should be noted in the labeling to inform consumers.” Compliance Date and Small Businesses TTB asked:  Does the proposed compliance date suffice to limit the negative impact on small businesses and reduce overall costs of compliance while ensuring that consumers receive adequate information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the alcohol beverage products they are purchasing and consuming? In my view, the costs of label compliance are substantial, especially for smaller producers. Much of this cost could be avoided by setting the compliance timeframe slightly longer than the average industry label turnover, which is approximately five years. Therefore, I recommend a six-year compliance timeframe. This period would apply to both small and large producers, allowing them to comply earlier on a voluntary basis, while the mandatory requirement would only take effect after six years. This approach would be economically efficient and impose less regulatory burden. Benefits of Alcohol Content Statements TTB asked:  What are the potential benefits to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products? I believe that alcohol content expressed as a percentage by volume has been familiar and useful for consumers for years. It provides a clear and straightforward measure that helps consumers make informed decisions. This approach avoids many of the complications associated with alcohol quantity, serving sizes, and package sizes. Therefore, I support requiring alcohol content percentage on all beverages. Alcohol Content Tolerances TTB asked:  Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers? If so, does the same argument apply to wines, which currently have a 1.5 percentage point tolerance for wines up to 14 percent alcohol by volume, and a 1 percentage point tolerance for wines with an alcohol content of over 14 percent alcohol by volume?  6 \nIn my experience, consumers do not focus on decimal points and fractions. A reasonable tolerance level is acceptable for consumers, as they do not require precise laboratory measurements. Aligning the tolerance for malt beverages with that for wines should be adequate. Broader tolerances accommodate natural product variations and reduce the need for frequent batch testing for alcohol content. Labeling for Non-Alcoholic Malt Beverages TTB asked:  Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume? Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements? It seems evident that non-alcoholic malt beverages absolutely must have a label disclosing that they contain small (or trace) amounts of alcohol. This is important for individuals who avoid alcohol for religious, dietary, medical, or legal reasons. If these beverages are already subject to labeling requirements from other agencies, TTB need not impose further labeling. However, if there is an oversight gap, TTB should ensure proper labeling. Alcohol Content Range for Table Wines TTB asked:  Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers? It seems to me that to reduce the disproportionate burden on small wineries and importers, they should be allowed to indicate alcohol content as a range for table wines. This approach would provide sufficient information to consumers while relieving some of the regulatory burden. Allowing a range would be consistent with the reasons discussed in the NPRM and would not unfairly penalize consumers by depriving them of important information. Dietary Guidelines on Moderate Drinking TTB asked:  Should the proposed mandatory Alcohol Facts statement include a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking (to be updated based on any changes in the guidelines over time)?  7 \nMy thoughts are that including dietary advice on moderate drinking has no place on these labels. The purpose of the labels is to disclose the contents of the beverage container to consumers, not to provide general education on drinking habits. Such information does not add to the purchasing decision process and is outside the scope of the rule. While it may be useful in some contexts, it is not appropriate for product labeling.  Thank you for considering my comments. I hope they provide valuable insights and contribute to the successful finalization of the Alcohol Facts labeling regulations.

In order to reduce \nthe burden on businesses in both countries as much as possible and to prevent any \nproblems regarding trade, Japan would like to make the following requests: \n \n[Comment 1] \nRegarding nutrient labeling requirements, we would like nutrients to be listed only if \nmentioned nutrients are present at a certain level or higher. In the case of alcoholic \nbeverages, most products do not contain, or contain only a de minimis amount of, \nfat and protein. We believe that it should not be mandatory to label substances that \nare not present or that are present only a small amount in a product. \n \n[Comment 2] \nTTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule is \npublished in the Federal Register. As it is necessary to ensure that businesses have \nsufficient time to prepare for making changes to labels of their products, we request \nthat the proposed 5-year period be maintained, and not be shortened. \n \n[Comment 3] \nGiven that label space is limited, in order to reduce  the burden on businesses we \nwould like it to be possible to provide Alcohol Facts through electronic  means such \nas QR codes. By allowing the use of electronic means, we believe that businesses \nwill find it easier to accommodate different languages and to update information, \nthereby reducing the burden of displaying Alcohol Facts. If this request is not granted, \nthis will become a trade barrier. \n \n[Comment 4] \nAlthough the proposal does not make analytical testing mandatory, nevertheless we \nwould like the TTB website to clearly state proper analytical testing methods for each \nnutrient for reference. When we examined TTB website, w e found we were unable \nto confirm the contents of the Official TTB method described in the TTB Procedures \n2020-1, and we were also unable to access the AOAC method for free. It would be  \n \n2 \n \nmuch appreciated if a document containing all of  the information necessary for \nanalysis would be made publicly available free of charge, for reference. We also ask \nthat the proposed tolerance of 20 percent, either above or below the stated amount \nof calorie, carbohydrate, protein and fat, not be altered. \n \nWe would also like the U.S. to answer the following questions: \n \n[Question 1] \nRegarding the serving size, given that a serving size  for sake i s not explicitly \nmentioned in the proposal, do you anticipate that sake will use the reference amount \nfor wine? \n \n[Question 2] \nThe proposal allows b usinesses to rely on  published databases rather than on \nanalytical testing. Would it be acceptable to quote and use databases published by \nany organization in any country? If you expect any specific published databases to \nbe referenced, we would appreciate it if you could share that information with us.

These labels will help fulfill the administration’s goals of \npreventing and reducing chronic disease. \nThe “First Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health” was issued in 1971, but even by that time \nthe health risks of consuming alcohol had already been well documented.1 As the evidence on alcohol’s health \nrisks continues to mount, our organization recommends the current warning label on alcoholic beverages, which \nfirst appeared in 1989, be updated to better protect Americans by listing specific health risks, as well as nutrition \nand allergen information. \nThe label, which has not been updated in more than 35 years, currently reads: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) \nAccording to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the \nrisk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate \nmachinery and may cause health problems.”2 \nUsing the vague term “health problems” leaves Americans unaware of the true toll alcohol consumption can have \non health, including a growing understanding of how it raises the risk of several types of cancer. It is vital that this \nlabel be updated to reflect the increased evidence and understanding of the specific risks of alcohol consumption. \nIn January 2025, the Surgeon General released “Alcohol and Cancer Risk,” an advisory report that cites scientific \nevidence on the link between alcohol consumption and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, \nincluding breast (in women), colorectum, esophagus, laryngeal, liver, mouth, and throat.3 The report recommends \nthat the existing Surgeon General’s health warning label on alcohol-containing beverages be updated to include a \nwarning about the risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption. Our organization, which has 17,000 doctor \nmembers, already recommends avoiding alcohol as part of our Let’s Beat Breast Cancer campaign, which \nprovides healthcare providers and the public with evidence-based resources and powerful steps to reduce breast \ncancer risk.4 This campaign echoes the recently passed policies of the American Medical Association, which \nsupport not only clearer alcohol labelling but also efforts to educate the public about the benefits of lifestyle \nchanges that may reduce breast cancer risk, including limiting alcohol intake, regular physical activity, \nmaintenance of a healthy body weight, and a healthy plant-based diet.5 This policy also encourages physicians to \nregularly discuss with their individual patients the benefits of lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk.  In addition to adding a cancer warning, we recommend that the label also address other health risks to the liver, \nbrain, gut, pancreas, lungs, cardiovascular system, immune system, and other parts of the body, as detailed by the \nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.6  \nIngredient information should also be included for those looking to avoid allergens—such as sulfites and grains \nlike wheat, rye, or barley—or animal products that are sometimes used as flavoring or fining agents, which are \nused to filter out impurities and improve the clarity of some alcoholic beverages. 7 Common animal-based fining \nagents include milk byproducts including whey, casein, and lactose. Other ingredients commonly found in \nalcoholic beverages include eggs; isinglass, which is derived from fish bladders; and gelatin, which is derived \nfrom animal skin, bones, and cartilage.8 Consumers who wish to avoid consumption of these ingredients, whether \nfor health or other reasons, should have access to this information. \nUpdated warning labels on alcohol are long overdue and should reflect current knowledge about the health risks \nof alcohol, as well as allergen and ingredient information that will help Americans make well-informed decisions. \nThank you for your attention to this important issue. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nStephanie McBurnett, RDN, LDN \nNutrition Educator \nPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine \n \n \n \nReferences: \n \n1 National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Ryan \nAdministrator \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) \nU.S. Department of Treasury \n \nComment on Proposed Rules re Alcohol Facts Statements, Major Food Allergens in the Labeling of \nWines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Dockets No. TTB-2025-0002; TTB-2025-0003) \nVIA ONLINE SUBMISSION \nDear Administrator Ryan:  \nConsumer Federation of America appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important \nrulemaking. As noted in our joint comments with the Center for Science in the Public Interest \n(CSPI) and other public health and consumer advocates, we strongly support the Alcohol and \nTobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rules to mandate AlcoholௗFacts panels and \nMajorௗFoodௗAllergen disclosures on wines, spirits, and malt beverages, and encourage TTB to \nstrengthen the rule by requiring disclosure elements such as added sugars in grams, saturated fat in \ngrams, and sodium in milligrams, within the “Alcohol Facts” panel, and by further specifying the \nformat and location of allergen disclosures on labels. We write separately here to underscore how \nthis rulemaking advances the Administration’s stated “Make America Healthy Again” objectives, and \nto urge you to follow through with ingredients labeling requirements that will give consumers the \nbasic information on alcoholic beverage labels that they have come to expect when buying all other \nbeverages and food. \nLeading wellness influencers have called attention to the lack of transparency in alcohol \nlabeling. The “Food Babe” Vani Hari has pointed out that “the government agency that regulates \nalcoholic drinks does not require alcohol manufacturers to label their ingredients or tell consumers \nwhat’s actually in their drinks,”1 and cited various brands that “are trying to slowly poison us with \ncheap and harmful ingredients.”2 In response to the question of how alcohol fits with MAHA, \nCalley Means, a special advisor to HHS Secretary Kennedy, stated “Phase 1 of MAHA is full \ntransparency on what’s making us sick to the American people.”3 \nCFA welcomes this call for full transparency, which we have been asking for in alcohol \nlabeling for over 20 years. Better labeling will not eliminate all alcohol-related harms, but the \navailable evidence indicates that it will help reduce those harms. For instance, researchers have \ndocumented that consumers are aware of calorie counts for alcohol on restaurant menus,4 and that \n \n1 hƩps://foodbabe.com/alcoholic-drink/  \n2 hƩps://foodbabe.com/the-shocking-ingredients-in-beer/  \n3 hƩps://www.statnews.com/2025/01/14/alcohol-health-risks-rŅ-jr-maha  \n4 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.17269/s41997-021-00599-0  enactment of state laws requiring menu calorie labeling for alcohol were correlated with a small but \nsignificant decline in reported alcohol consumption.5  \nSimilarly, researchers have found that labels with information about the number of standard \ndrinks per container and low risk drinking guidelines help consumers to more accurately estimate \ntheir alcohol consumption than percentage alcohol by volume (%ABV) alone.6 Even consumers that \ndo not pay attention to alcohol labels may still benefit from a broader population shift towards more \nconscientious consumption. Across the world, research shows that declines in the overall level of \nalcohol consumption—the average per capita consumption—coincide with reduced alcohol-related \nharms.7  \nThese spillover effects support a broad range of policies to provide accurate information to \nconsumers about alcohol, both on and off the label. In particular, as President Trump’s nominee for \nSurgeon General, Casey Means, has pointed out, “people don’t realize [] that alcohol is the third \nbiggest risk factor for cancer other than smoking and obesity,” and that “[e]ven 1 drink per day can \nincrease the risk of some cancers.”8 The combined high public health burden, and low public \nawareness, of alcohol attributable cancers support lower recommended limits for “moderate \ndrinking” in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and a cancer warning on alcohol labels. Updating \nthe health warning statement on labels will require Congress to amend the Alcoholic Beverage \nLabeling Act of 1988, and so the Administration will need to exercise leadership to accomplish that \nworthy objective. In the meantime, however, TTB should follow through on this rulemaking and its \npledge to propose a rule requiring ingredients disclosure.  \nThere is no good reason for alcohol labels to omit the standard information consumers see \non the labels of every other food and beverage product. This era of alcohol labeling exceptionalism \ncan end with this Administration and absolutely should if the MAHA agenda is to be taken seriously.   \nThank you for your consideration of these comments.  \nSincerely,  \n  \nThomas Gremillion \n Director of Food Policy \n Consumer Federation of America \n \n \n5 hƩps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/arƟcle/abs/pii/S0091743517302359  \n6 hƩps://link.springer.com/arƟcle/10.1186/s12889-023-16327-x  \n7 Rossow I, Mäkelä P.

These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record\n\n4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails Legal, Truth, and\nAnalytical Requirements\n\n5. The Biden-proposed Aicohol Facts Rule Fails Legal, Benefit-Cost, and\nAnalytical Requirements\n\neR RE\n\n1. The Biden-proposed Rules Aim Directly at the Small Businesses\nThat Constitute Most of the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Indust\n\nCensus Bureau data from 2017 published by the Treasury Department? shows that\nsmall businesses (here those with fewer than 20 employees) constitute most of the\nbeer, wine, and spirits industry:\n\nLine of Number of Firms That Had\n\nBusiness Total No. ofFirms Fewer Than 20 Employees Percentage\nBreweries 3,214 2,609 81%\nWineries 3,576 2,975 83%\nDistilleries 760 659 86%\n\nIn the Treasury Department report Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and\nSpirits (February 2022), the Department stated that the United States had more than\n6,400 operating breweries, 6,600 operating wineries, and 1,900 operating distilleries.\nThe report further stated: “While larger firms account for significant market share, the\nnumber of smaller brewers, vintners, and distillers, often called the craft sector, has\n\n2 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 1.\n\n? Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022), p.\n2, available at https://nome.treasury.gowsystem/files/136/Competition-Report.pdf (visited July 25, 2025).\ngrown dramatically but still occupies only a small share of the market.’ Thus, the\nGovernment\'s own data makes clear that, when the Treasury Department aims new\nlabeling requirements at the beer, wine, and spirits industry, it hits primarily small\nbusinesses.5 The two Biden-proposed rules fail to recognize the practicalities of\nrunning small businesses and fail to make the adjustments for small businesses that the\ncongressional policy stated in the Regulatory Flexibility Act contemplates.®\n\nSmall businesses, unlike the corporate behemoths in the beer, wine, and spirits industry\nwhose names and fortunes most everyone knows, cannot afford the bevy of lawyers\nand experts necessary to decipher the rules and physically implement them, let alone\nafford the cost of changes in processing and machinery to accommodate them.\nRegulatory compliance costs small business owners time and money, both of which are\ngenerally in short supply as they strive to keep their small businesses going, meet their\ncustomers’ needs, and create jobs. The Biden-proposed rules would impose\nunaffordable, unwarranted costs on small businesses and constitute an anti-competitive\nbarrier for small businesses that cannot afford such costs in comparison to the giants in\nthe industry who can.\n\nThe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\nfail to take appropriate account of the needs of small businesses as called for in the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).” In paragraph 2(a)(4) of the RFA, Congress declared\nthat “the failure to recognize differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities\nhas in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the marketplace,\n\n4 Department of the Treasury, Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits (February 2022), p.\n8.\n\n5 Indeed, the Department of the Treasury admitted, in explaining the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling\nRule, that “most businesses subject to the proposed rule are small businesses ....” 90 Fed, Reg. at\n5775, col. 2.\n\n§ As the adoption in 1919 of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the manufacture,\nsale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors and its repeal in 1933 by the 21st Amendment reflect,\ndiffering views exist among Americans about whether, to what extent, and under what conditions sale and\nconsumption of alcoholic beverages should occur, and the relevance of and weight to give to health,\nmoral, and religious factors in addressing those matters. NFIB expresses in this letter no view on these\nquestions. NFIB notes that federal and state law currently allow sale and consumption of beer, wine, and\nspirits, and that free market principles, with minimal government intervention tailored closely to sound\nscience and public safety and health, should apply with respect to the sale and use of lawful products.\nNFIB also notes that adults with allergies to major allergens who choose to consume beer, wine, or spirits\nhave available to them sound advice on how to enjoy themselves safely in alcoholic beverage\nenvironments. See, for example, FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), by Carlo Steinman, “Out\nto Drink (Alcohol) with Food Allergies,” available at https:/Avww. foodallergy.org/resources/out-drink-\nalcohol-food-allergies (visited July 25, 2025). Aiso, Americans generally have available to them the\nguidance on alcoho] consumption in The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, available at\nhttps:/Avww.dietaryguidelines.gow/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-\n2025.pdf (visited July 25, 2025).\n\n7 Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 note.\ndiscouraged innovation and restricted improvements in productivity .. . .”. Congress\nalso noted in paragraph 2(a)(6) of the RFA that “the practice of treating all regulated\nbusinesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions as equivalent may lead to\ninefficient use of regulatory agency resources, enforcement problems, and, in some\ncases, to actions inconsistent with the legislative intent of health, safety, environmental\nand economic welfare legislation. . . .” Instead, the explanation for the proposed rules\nsimply raises a small business exemption as a strawman alternative and immediately\ndismisses it.®\n\nPresident Trump noted that America’s small businesses employ nearly half the\ncountry’s private work force and create two-thirds of net new jobs, and said:\n\nMy Administration is unleashing a new era of opportunity for small businesses built\non common sense and pro-growth policies that put our workers and our job creators\nfirst. We are cutting red tape, keeping taxes low, promoting fair and reciprocal trade\npractices, and fighting for hardworking Americans.°\n\nTo help make true what the President said about putting job creators first and cutting\nred tape, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-proposed Allergen\nLabeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\n2. TTB Did Not Get the President\'s Deregula’ Message\n\nPresident Trump could not have been clearer to the federal bureaucracies that they\nshould seek to deregulate, rather than further regulate, the American economy.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 -- eleven days after President Trump took office and fourteen days\nafter TTB published in the Federal Register the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule\nand the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule, President Trump issued Executive Order\n14192 on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” The President said: “The\never-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on\nthe lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic\ngrowth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.” He\nalso said: “It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private\n\n8 90 Fed. Reg. at 5775, col. 3 (in reference to the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling rule: “TTB\nconsidered other options to reduce the regulatory burden and cost for small businesses, but ultimately is\nnot proposing them. One option considered was to exempt small businesses from the requirements of\nthe proposed rule. The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to provide information to consumers who\nare allergic to one or more of the nine major food allergens. This purpose would be weakened by a\npermanent exemption for small businesses. Consumers would not be able to rely on alcohol beverage\nlabels to disclose the presence of major food allergens if the requirements did not apply to all such\nproducts.”). Thus, the Treasury Department did precisely the kind of dismissive, one-size-must-fit-all\npseudo-consideration of a small business alternative that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to\ncombat.\n\n® Proclamation 10932 of May 5, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 19609 (May 8, 2025).\nexpenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic\nprosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.”\nHe emphasized that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch . . . to alleviate\nunnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” *°\n\nOn February 19, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14219 on “Ensuring\nLawful Governance and Implementing the President\'s ‘Department of Government\nEfficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative.” The President made clear that agency heads should\nidentify regulations that undermine the national interest, including “regulations that\nimpose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits”\nand “regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private\nenterprise and entrepreneurship.”*\'\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14267 on “Reducing Anti-\nCompetitive Regulatory Barriers.” The order stated: “Federal regulations should not\npredetermine economic winners and losers.” The order further stated: “Regulations that\nreduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation -- as well as the benefits they\ncreate for American consumers -- should be eliminated.” The President directed\nagency heads to identify anti-competitive regulations that “impose anti-competitive ...\ndistortions on the operation of a free market.”!2\n\nThese are not old orders by other Presidents that the bureaucracies can safely (though\nimproperly) ignore. These are not Executive Musings, Executive Wishes, or Executive\nSuggestions to the bureaucracies. These are Executive Orders to the bureaucracies,\nissued by the President the American people elected to direct those bureaucracies.\n\nTo comply with the clear anti-regulation, pro-competition policies the President set in the\nquoted Executive Orders, the Treasury Department needs to withdraw the Biden-\nproposed Allergen Labeling Rule and the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. And the\nDepartment of the Treasury should draw Executive Orders 14192, 14219, and 14267 to\nthe specific attention of the head of TTB and the departmental supervisors of the head\nof TTB, to help the Department avoid issuance in the future of regulatory proposals that\nunreasonably burden small and other businesses.\n\n1° Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (January 31, 2025), 90 Fed.

These Biden-proposed Rules Originated from a Flimsy Record\n\nTTB says\'® it pursued the Biden-proposed rules based on two things: (1) a finding and a\nrecommendation in the Treasury Department February 2022 report titled Competition in\nthe Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits \'4 (“Treasury Competition Report”), and (2) a\nFebruary 24, 2021, letter from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)\'®\njoined by six other organizations. Those documents, whether considered individually or\ntogether, do not provide a reasonable and practical basis for pursuing the Biden-\nproposed rules.\n\nRegarding the Treasury Competition Report, TTB quotes\'® the Executive Summary at\nthe front of the Report finding it a matter of concern that “[rjegulatory proposals that\ncould serve public health and foster competition by providing information to consumers,\nsuch as mandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been\nimplemented”? and a recommendation at the other end of the report stating that “TTB\nshould revive or initiate rulemaking proposing ingredient labeling and mandatory\ninformation on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.”!® In\nbetween the finding at the front of the report and the recommendation at the back of the\nreport, a scant five paragraphs’? addressed the matters that ended up in the\nrecommendation, and none of it was science as opposed to expressions of views by\ncommenters or views of the TTB itself. So, the Treasury Competition Report\nrecommendation provides no real justification for proceeding with the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule. Moreover, although the finding mentioned allergen labeling, the\nrecommendation does not mention allergen labeling -- it mentions only ingredient\nlabeling, alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes.

Advocacy to the federal and\nstate governments on regulatory subjects is a perfectly permissible activity protected by\nthe First Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances, and corresponding state\nconstitutional provisions, but no federal agency should view such advocacy as a\ncomplete and unbiased basis for initiating a rulemaking process.\n\n4. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule Fails\nLegal, Truth, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAllergen Labeling Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue\nthe rule, the rule compels untruthful speech, and TTB failed to conduct and provide the\nbenefit-cost analyses required by law and Executive Order.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,’ and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment allergen labeling authority.

The provision is administered by the TTB under the authority of section 534(d) of\ntitle 6 of the U.S. Code. The Treasury Department stated: “Section 105(e) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C.\n205(e)) gives the Secretary authority to issue labeling regulations to prevent deception of the consumer,\nto provide the consumer with ‘adequate information’ as to the identity, quality, and alcohol content of the\nproduct, and to prohibit false or misleading statements. Additionally, the FAA Act gives the Secretary the\nauthority to prohibit, irrespective of falsity, labeling statements relating to age, manufacturing processes,\nanalyses, guarantees, and scientific or irrelevant matters which are likely to mislead the consumer. In the\ncase of malt beverages, the labeling provisions of the FAA Act apply only if the laws or regulations of the\nState into which the mait beverages are to be shipped impose similar requirements.” 90 Fed. Reg. at\n5764, col. 1.\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim major\nallergen labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling reguiations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]’ Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep\n(noscitur a sociis in Latin), the requirement for adequacy of information applies to things\nthat are like identity, quality, alcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or\nimporter -- but not what substances were used in the production of the beverage. Also,\napplying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes that\nCongress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic significance”\nunless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant allergen\nlabeling authority. Accordingly, the Treasury Department lacks fegal authority to issue\nthe Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule.\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule requires a label to state ""Contains\nMajor Food Allergen(s)” even if the beer, wine, or distilled spirits in the bottle do not, in\nfact, actually contain one or more of the major food allergens.”* It is bad enough that\nTTB forces compelled speech upon the manufacturers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits\nwith its labeling requirement, but it is truly beyond the pale for TTB to compel speech\nthat is untrue. Proposed 27 CFR 4.32, 5.63, and 7.63 require, respectively, a wine,\ndistilled spirits, or malt beverage label, to list a major allergen if that allergen “is used in\nthe production of” the item.25 But it may be possible in some cases to use a major\nallergen in the production of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits without any of the\nallergen ending up in the beer, wine, or distilled spirits. TTB recognizes this possibility\nin exempting from labeling a major allergen used in the production of distilled spirits if\nthe allergen was completely distilled so that no protein remains in the distilled spirits.7°\nIf an allergen is used in the production of wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverages, but\n\n23 The U.S, beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (Source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-1 92dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf), and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM. pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market (all sources visited July 25, 2025).\n\n24 The proposal requires labeling for any of nine major food allergens: milk, egg, fish, Crustacean\nshellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. 90 Fed.

To evade calculating the costs, TTB simply said:\n\n... TTB estimates that the marginal additional cost of the Allergen rule above the\ncost of the proposed Alcohol Facts rule is negligible. This is because industry\nmembers would generally have to make a major label change to comply with the\nAlcohol Facts rule, and industry members that were additionally affected by any new\nallergen labeling requirements from this rulemaking would be able to undertake just\none label change to comply with the requirements of the two rules.2°\n\nThe TTB then blithely asserted that it had no duty to conduct an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis because the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of smail entities.22 TTB has no business\nassuming in the Biden-proposed Allergen Rule preamble that the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule will be adopted, thereby making the cost of the Allergen Labeling\nRule marginal because it can piggyback on the Alcohol Facts label. TTB has a legal\nduty to keep an open mind on whether to adopt the Alcohol Facts proposed rule and\nmust consider with an open mind the comments it will receive on that proposed rule.°°\nTTB had a duty to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis for three possible outcomes\nof the rulemaking process: (1) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol Facts rule and a\nfinal Allergen Labeling Rule; (2) TTB ends up adopting a final Alcohol! Facts rule, but not\nan Allergen Labeling Rule; and (3) TTB ends up adopting a final Allergen Labeling Rule,\nbut not a final Alcohol Facts rule. The Biden-proposed Allergen Labeling Rule fails to\ncomply with the requirement for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis under section 603\n\n27 See TTB discussion of using “scientifically valid analytical methods’ to verify the absence of proteins in\nfinal products. 90 Fed.

The Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule Fails\nLegal, Benefit-Cost, and Analytical Requirements\n\nIn addition to the heavy and unwarranted compliance burden the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts Rule imposes on small businesses, TTB has no lawful basis to issue the\nrule, failed to conduct and provide the benefit-cost analyses required by law and\nExecutive Order, and failed to provide the initial regulatory flexibility analysis required by\nlaw.\n\nFirst, no federal agency has any power whatsoever unless Congress has by law\nconferred that power on the agency,°2 and the law does not provide the Treasury\nDepartment authority to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts rule. The Treasury\nDepartment claims authority to impose alcohol facts labeling from two sources: (1)\nchapter 51 and sections 5301, 5368, and 5412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2)\nsection 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.*? None of those statutes grant\nthe authority to impose the Alcohol Facts labeling that the Biden Administration\nproposed.\n\nOf the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions the Treasury Department cites, only\nthree provisions approach the subject of labeling. Section 5301(a)(1) provides: “(a)\nREQUIREMENTS.--Whenever in his judgment such action is necessary to protect the\nrevenue, the Secretary is authorized, by the regulations prescribed by him and permits\nissued thereunder if required by him--(1) to regulate the kind, size, branding, marking,\nsale, resale, possession, use, and reuse of containers (of a capacity of not more than 5\nwine gallons) designed or intended for use for the sale of distilled spirits[.]’ Section\n5368 provides:\n\n(a) GAUGING AND MARKING.--All wine or wine spirits shall be locked, sealed, and\ngauged, and shall be marked, branded, labeled, or otherwise identified, in such\nmanner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\n31 Executive Order 12866, as amended, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (5 U.S.C. 601 note).\n\n22 Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘First, an agency literally has\nno power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until\nCongress confers power upon it.""); NF/B v. Department of Labor, OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022)\n(‘Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that\nCongress has provided."").\n\n33 90 Fed. Reg. 6654, col. 3 and 6655, cols. 1 and 2.\n1\n\n(b) MARKING.--Wines shall be removed in such containers (including vessels,\nvehicles, and pipelines) bearing such marks and labels, evidencing compliance with\nthis chapter, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.\n\nSection 5412 provides: “Beer may be removed from the brewery for consumption or\nsale only in hogsheads, packages, and similar containers, marked, branded, or labeled\nin such manner as the Secretary may by regulation require, except that beer may be\nremoved from the brewery pursuant to section 5414 or by pipeline to contiguous distilled\nspirits plants under section 5222.”\n\nThe three IRC provisions grant different authorities for distilled spirits, wine, and beer.\nSection 5301(a)(1) grants branding and marking authority, but not labeling authority, for\ndistilled spirits. Section 5368 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for wine.\nSection 5412 grants marking, branding, and labeling authority for beer. From the\ncomparison of the language in the three provisions, it is clear that labeling is different\nfrom marking and branding. So the first thing to note is that TTB has no authority to\nimpose the Alcohol Facts label on distilled spirits, especially given the inclusion of\nlabeling authority for wine and beer, but exclusion of it for distilled spirits.°* Note also\nthat the wine labeling authority is very limited under section 5368; it extends only to\nlabeling necessary for identification or to evidence “compliance with’ chapter 51 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, neither of which reaches the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule’s requirement for a label to show serving size, servings per container, alcohol by\nvolume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein. With respect to beer, section 5412\ngrants a labeling authority as long as the beer leaves the brewery in a container.\nAccordingly, the Treasury Department has no authority under the Internal Revenue\nCode to impose the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule on distilled spirits, wine, or\nbeer, except possibly for beer that leaves a brewery in a container.\n\nThe Treasury Department claim of labeling authority under section 105(e) of the Federal\nAlcohol Administration Act fares no better. The current absence of labeling on serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein by\nthe beer, wine, and distilled spirit industry does not involve actual or alleged deception,\nmisleading of consumers, inaccurate statements, disparaging, false, misleading,\nobscene, or indecent statements, or misleading brand or trade names, so the only\nprovision of section 105 under which the Treasury Department could claim Alcohol\nFacts labeling authority is section 105(e)(2).\n\nSection 105(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue labeling regulations\nfor bottled distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages “(2) as will provide the consumer with\nadequate information as to the identity and quality of the products, the alcoholic content\nthereof (except that statements of, or statements likely to be considered as statements\n\n34 Russelio v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[Wihere Congress includes particular language in\none section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”).\n12\n\nof, alcoholic content of malt beverages are prohibited unless required by State law and\nexcept that, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content shall be required only for\nwines containing more than 14 per centum of alcohoi by volume), the net contents of\nthe package, and the manufacturer or bottler or importer of the product[.]” Applying the\ncanon of statutory interpretation that words are known by the company they keep, the\nrequirement for adequacy of information applies to things that are like identity, quality,\nalcohol content, net content, and manufacturer, bottler, or importer -- but not serving\nsize, servings per container, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, or protein.\nAlso, applying the major questions canon of statutory interpretation, which presumes\nthat Congress has not delegated authority to issue rules of great economic\nsignificance** unless Congress clearly says as much, section 105(e)(2) does not grant\nalcohol facts labeling authority.\n\nThe Treasury Department\'s triai balloon in the preamble, claiming that Center for\nScience in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995, 999 n. 2\n(D.C. Cir. 1986) proves that section 105(e) gives TTB “a zone of discretion within which\nit can choose to require or not require ingredient disclosure, as necessary to provide\nconsumers with adequate information,”” lost ail its air with the U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). The 1986 D.C.\nCircuit case that recognized the “zone of discretion” said, referring to TTB’s institutional\npredecessor the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF): “Certainly, then,\nthere is no plain meaning of the phrase ‘adequate information’ which indicates\nCongress’ intent as to whether the FAA Act either requires or prohibits ingredient\ndisclosure regulations. ... BATF’s conclusion that the Act vests it with a zone of\ndiscretion within which it can choose to require or not to require ingredient disclosure,\nas necessary to provide consumers with adequate information, is thus consistent with\nthat congressional intent which can be discerned. We accordingly acquiesce in the\nagency’s interpretation of the general scope of its authority under § 205(e). See\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45,\n104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).""5° But in Loper Bright, the Supreme\nCourt rejected the Chevron reasoning the D.C. Circuit used in the 1986 case, by which\nthe Circuit found a statutory phrase ambiguous and deferred to the agency about its\n\n3% if the regulatory term “alcohol by volume” as used in the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule were\ndefined to be identical to the statutory term “alcoholic content,” then section 105(e)(2) would appear to\nauthorize that single aspect of the proposed labeling.\n\n36 The U.S. beer market is $117 billion (source: https:/Avww.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-\ndata/national-beer-stats/), wine market is $107 billion (source:\nhttps://commercial.bmo.com/media/filer_public/03/89/03891 f2e-3507-487f-a900-192dc5c9aefe/23-\n2509_wine_market_report_hz_v57_final-ua.pdf}, and spirits market is $38 billion (source:\nhttps:/Avww.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-AEB-Slide-Deck-2.6.24-517PM.pdf), for\na combined total of a $262 billion beer, wine, and spirits market.\n\n37 90 Fed.

The Supreme Court said: “Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their\nindependent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory\nauthority, as the APA [Administrative Procedure Act] requires.”9\n\nSo, at the end of the day, TTB has no statutory authority require the Biden-proposed\nAlcohol Facts label for distilled spirits, for wine, or for beer, except possibly for beer that\nleaves the brewery in containers. That conclusion should not be particularly surprising.\nCongress knows precisely how to authorize calorie and nutritional content labeling when\nit wants to do so, as it has done with respect to food in enacting section 403(q) of the\nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”\n\nSecond, the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule imposes much cost to achieve little\nbenefit. TTB estimates that the proposed rule, if made applicable in five years, will cost\nthe industry $201.2 million over five years, or $40.2 million per year to implement\n(figures expressed in 2023 dollars).** Also, recurring costs will occur in subsequent\nyears for as long as the rule remained in force. TTB’s negative statement that “TTB has\nno reason to believe that the proposed rule would require industry members to\npurchase new labeling equipment”? is a clever way of addressing the subject without\nadmitting that TTB cannot say affirmatively that the proposed rule will not require them\nto purchase such new equipment. And, of course, with more costly regulatory labeling\nrequirements, new entrants to the industry will face higher entry costs than they\notherwise would have faced.\n\nAs for benefits, TTB admits that, even though it has been considering the subject of\nalcohol facts labeling at least since December 2003, “TTB does not have data to\nquantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule[.]’“4 Again, TTB cleverly refers in\nthe absence of data to “the monetary benefits’ as opposed to “any monetary benefits,”\nassuming, without having any supporting data, that there are some monetary benefits.\nIn the end, TTB cites only two purported benefits for the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts\nRule:\n\nTTB does not have data to quantify the monetary benefits of the proposed rule, but\nas stated previously, the overall purpose of the proposed rule is to provide\nconsumers with more information about the identity, quality, and alcohol content of\nalcohol beverages. This information will in turn enable consumers to follow advice\n\n38 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024).\n4 24 U.S.C. 343(q).\n\n41 90 Fed.

Reg. at 6684, col 2.\n14\n\nabout moderate alcohol consumption and will provide them with additional\ninformation about the calorie and macronutrient content of alcohol beverages.\n\nThe first claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\n“enable consumers to follow advice about moderate alcohol consumption,” hangs by a\nthread. For the many consumers who do not read package labeling, the Alcohol Facts\nlabeling will have zero effect. And perhaps alcohol content and calorie counts would\nmean something to some consumers who read an Alcohol Facts label, but\ncarbohydrate, fat, and protein numbers will mean little if anything to most consumers.\nAlso, only consumers who serve themselves (for example, bought beer at the grocery\nstore), and not those served in establishments (for example, served a drink at a table in\na bar), will have the chance to see any labeling at all. And, for those who see a label, it\nmight be useful to consider whether the alleged drinking deterrence of an Aicoho! Facts\nlabel diminishes after one moderate drink (woman) or two moderate drinks (man) with\nrespect to whether another drink might occur.* And lastly, for some consumers, the\nAlcohol Facts labeling may have an anti-moderation effect, as it enables a consumer to\ncompare alcoholic content of different beer, wines and spirits and select a drink with a\nhigher alcohol content than the consumer might otherwise have chosen. TTB should\ntake human behavior into account to a greater degree before it makes and relies on\nassumptions about the effects of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule.\n\nThe second claimed benefit of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts labeling, that it will\nprovide consumers “with additional information about the calorie and macronutrient\ncontent of alcohol beverages,” is not a benefit -- it is merely a statement of what the\nproposed rule allegedly does. It says nothing about what the impact will be of providing\nthe additional information. And, as mentioned above, many consumers will not see the\nlabeling, will ignore the labeling, will not understand the labeling, or, if they see the\nlabeling, will make decisions other than the TTB-desired moderation decision.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the costs of the Biden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule\ngreatly outweigh the purported benefits of the proposed rule.\n\nThirdly, TTB’s failure to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the Biden-\nproposed Alcohol! Facts rule plainly violates section 603 of title 5 of the U.S. Code.4”\n\n4 90 Fed. Reg. at 6684, col. 2. TTB skips over the fact that the proposed rule’s mandated information\nrequirement goes far beyond “the identity, quality, and alcohol content” to reach serving size, servings per\ncontainer, alcohol by volume, calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.\n\n48 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, p. 18 (Key recommendation: “Alcoholic beverages—Adults of\nlegal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in\na day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better\nfor health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who\nare pregnant.”).\n\n47 Section 603(a) of title 5 states in part: “Whenever an agency is required by section 553 of this title, or\nany other law, to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, or publishes a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking for an interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws of the United\n15\n\nTTB claims that it has no duty to provide such an analysis because section 605 of title 5\n“allows the head of an agency to certify that a rule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" And\nimmediately thereafter TTB states: “TTB certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted,\nwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\nBut that certification is plainly incorrect, by TTB’s own admissions in the preambles to\nthe proposed rules.\n\nn\n\nThe data TTB provides in the preambles show more than 80% of the 7,550 enterprises\n(a substantial number) in the beer, wine, and spirits industry are small businesses (in\nthis case, with fewer than 20 employees each) and that the implementation costs of the\nproposed rule exceed $40 million per year over five years (without even taking account\nof recurring costs).42 The TTB’s implementation cost estimate per enterprise, then, is\n$5,298 per year. So, TTB estimates, each of the small businesses would spend $5,298\nper year in the first five years, plus recurring costs on into the future, to carry out the\nBiden-proposed Alcohol Facts Rule. With the average small business owner making\nabout $69,000 per year,®° it is plain that a new $5,298 per year government-imposed\ncharge on small businesses with the proposed rule is significant.\n\nParticularly galling is the statement TTB made in attempting (but failing) to justify its\ndecision to certify that the proposed rule has no significant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities:\n\nThe production, bottling, importation, and distribution of alcohol beverages is an\nindustry subject to extensive Federal, State, and local regulation. The labeling and\nadvertising regulations under the FAA Act have been in place since 1936. Adding\nmore elements of mandatory information to the label will not have a significant\nimpact on the regulated industry.°!\n\nThe TTB attitude that the industry is already so highly regulated on labeling that adding\nmore labeling requirements really does not matter is appalling, contrary to presidential\npolicy, and contrary to law. TTB had a duty to publish an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis under section 603 of title 5 and failed to comply with that law.\n\nkkKEK\n\nStates, the agency shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis.”\n\n48 90 Fed.

Recover Alaska strongly supports \nthis rule as a long-overdue and commonsense step toward transparency that will help \nprotect public health and empower consumers to make more informed choices. \nRecover Alaska is a statewide multi-sector coalition working to reduce excessive alcohol \nuse and its harms across our state. Alaska experiences some of the highest alcohol-related \ndeath rates in the country. In 2021, our alcohol-induced mortality rate was more than twice \nthe national average, and Alaska continues to grapple with the ripple effects of alcohol \nmisuse—including high rates of suicide, domestic violence, and child maltreatment. These \nconsequences are deeply felt in our rural and Tribal communities, which already face major \nhealth disparities and limited access to services. \nAs a public health organization, we ﬁnd it unacceptable that alcohol—the only consumable \nproduct in the U.S. directly linked to seven types of cancer—is not required to carry a \nstandard nutrition or content label. Consumers have a right to know what is in the products \nthey consume, just as they do with food, tobacco, and other regulated substances. \nWe urge TTB to ﬁnalize and strengthen this proposed rule in the following ways: \n1. Require On-Package Alcohol Facts Labels \nVital health information should not be relegated to QR codes or websites. Labels \nmust appear directly on alcohol packaging to ensure accessibility—especially for \npeople in rural or remote regions, older adults, and those without reliable internet or \nsmartphones. In Alaska, this is particularly relevant where broadband access is \nlimited and supply chains are complex. \n2. Include Number of Standard Drinks and DGA Guidance \nTo support informed drinking decisions, labels should include the number of \nstandard drinks per container and refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’  \nadvice on moderate drinking. This helps consumers relate alcohol content to \nrecommended limits and personal health goals. \n3. Mandate Dual-Column and Expanded Nutrition Labeling \nDual-column labeling (per serving and per container) should be mandatory, not \nvoluntary. Many consumers unknowingly consume an entire container of alcohol in \none sitting. Additionally, the Alcohol Facts panel should require disclosure of \nnutrients the DGA advises limiting: added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. \n4. Shorten the Compliance Period to 3.5 Years \nPublic health and safety cannot wait ﬁve more years. A 3.5-year compliance period \nstrikes a more appropriate balance between industry readiness and consumers’ \nright to know what they’re drinking. \nAs communities and families in Alaska continue to face the heavy burden of alcohol-\nrelated harm, this rule represents a simple yet powerful step toward awareness, \nprevention, and accountability. We commend the TTB for proposing this rule and urge its \nswift adoption with the enhancements outlined above. \nThank you for your leadership in protecting public health through meaningful, transparent \nalcohol policy. \nSincerely, \n \nTiffany Hall \nPresident & CEO \nRecover Alaska \n \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': ""To Whom It May Concern,<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule to require Alcohol Facts labeling on wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages.

Greenberg \nDirector \nRegulations and Rulings Division \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \n1310 G Street, N.W., Box 12 \nWashington, D.C.  20005  \n \nRe:  Comments to TTB Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB–2025–0002) \n \nDear Director Greenberg,  \n \nCampari America LLC (“Campari America”), a producer and importer of distilled spirits in the \nUnited States, submits the following comments in response to the TTB’s Notice No. 237, “Alcohol Facts \nStatements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages ,” Docket No. TTB –2025–\n0002.  Campari America is a subsidiary of Davide Campari -Milano N.V., which began in 1860 with its \none eponymous brand.  Today, Campari America sells a wide range of beverage alcohol products in \nthe United States, but is most well-known for its portfolio of liqueurs, including Campari, Aperol, Averna, \nFrangelico, Cynar, Braulio , and Grand Marnier .  Many of t hese brands, like those of many other \nsuppliers, are not accurately represented in the TTB’s currently proposed serving size reference table, \npasted below for reference, and which is the basis of our comment today.   \nServing size Alcohol percent by volume \nWine Distilled spirits Malt beverages \n1.5 fl oz (44 mL), or 50 mL for 50 \nmL containers of distilled spirits \nn/a > 24% > 24%. \n2.5 fl oz (74 mL) > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% > 16, up to 24% \n5 fl oz (148 mL) 7 to 16% > 7, up to 16% > 7, up to 16% \n12 fl oz (355 mL) n/a ≤ 7% ≤ 7%. \n \nProposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Low ABV Liqueurs Are Consumed in Cocktails \n \nThe serving sizes recommended above are based in the assumption that the only means of \ndrinking a wine, beer, or spirits beverage is straight, unmixed with other beverages.  While this may be \nmostly true for wine and beer, it is most certainly not true for distilled spirits which often serve as \n“ingredients” in a wide range of cocktails.  By way of example, Aperol \uf0d2, which has an ABV of 11%, is \nmost commonly consumed in the form of an Aperol Spritz \uf0d2.  When making the brand’s signature \ncocktail, the typical amount of Aperol used is typically 2 ounces, i.e. less than half of what would be \nconsidered its reference serving size under the TTB’s proposal.  Another Aperol cocktail growing in \nDocusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 \n \npopularity is the Paper Plane (0.75 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz Aperol, 0.75 oz Amaro Nonino, and 0.75 oz \nlemon juice), in which the Aperol consumed is less than 1/5 of the TTB proposed serving size. \nCampari\uf0d2 faces a similar issue.  While it can be served in a Campari Spritz (typically 1.5 to 2 \nounces), it is also popularly served in a Boulevardier (1 oz Campari, 1 .5 oz bourbon, and 1 oz sweet \nvermouth) or a Negroni (1 oz Campari, 1 oz gin, and 1 oz sweet vermouth) or a Negroni Sbagliato \n(substitute prosecco for gin ).  There is also the Americano (1oz Campari, 1oz sweet vermouth, and a \nsplash of club soda) and the Garibaldi (1.5 oz Campari and the fresh juice of one orange, approximately \n4 oz). \nExamples of similar uses of other low-ABV liqueurs in cocktails abound.  Simply put, these are \nnot products that are typically drunk straight.  So while the ABV of a lower proof distilled spirit may be \nsimilar to wine, it is not consumed in the same manner – thus using the same serving size as wine of 5 \noz., or even 2.5 oz, significantly overstates and distorts the actual serving size of these low ABV liqueurs \nin a way that is misleading and confusing for consumers.  \n \nProposed Serving Sizes Do Not Reflect How Ready-To-Drink Canned Products Are Consumed \n \nConversely, for many other products, such as  ready-to-drink can s of  “hard” seltzers and \ncocktails, the currently proposed serving sizes greatly understate the actual serving sizes of these \nproducts.  These products are commonly sold in a 12 -oz can and can vary from 3.5% to 1 4% ABV.  \nSpirits-based cocktails are not the only beverage alcohol products facing this issue:  many beers and \nother malt-based beverages now exceed 7% ABV yet are sold in the same 12 oz size cans.  Likewise, \ncanned wines, with ABVs ranging from 8 to 15%, are also sold in sizes larger than the proposed serving \nsize of 5 oz.  In these instances, having a serving size reference range that is less than the container \nsize will certainly mislead consumers into thinking they are drinking less alcohol than they really are. \n \nRecommended Serving Sizes Already Have A Long-Established Framework and Methodology \n \nAs a proposed solution, we recommend adopting an approach similar to  the methodology of \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for recommended serving sizes for food and non-alcoholic \nbeverages.  The FDA creates reference points, known as “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed” \nor “RACCs,” for different categories of food and beverage, and the FDA then recommends that \nmanufacturers use those RACCs as a guideline for determining their advertised serving sizes.   \n \nIn the food and non -alcoholic beverage realm, FDA-required labelling became required in the \n1990s.  Consumers are long accustomed to this method of calculation of serving facts, with \nrecommended or actual consumption amounts being the guiding factor in determining the size.   The \ngeneral understanding of most consumers is that a serving size reflects the size portion of intended or \ntypical consumption, or, in the case of single -serve packs, the container size, rather than being based \non the amount of one of its components .  One analogy would be if the FDA mandated serving sizes \nbased on the grams of protein in a product, such as 5g of protein equals one serving size.  This would \nresult in a double serving size for a granola bar, and a very small serving size for beef jerky.  Similarly, \nthe TTB’s proposed serving sizes are based on the amount of alcohol in a product, resulting in arbitrary \nand sometimes incorrect serving sizes.  The current proposed TTB’s serving sizes would conflict with \nDocusign Envelope ID: 4BF3A609-7A08-4604-B4FD-DE8BB7C974E2 \n \nthe general understanding of most consumers who have been conditioned for decades to perceive a \nserving size as the recommended amount and/or most customarily consumed amount. \n \nIf the TTB were to adopt a serving size reference range that mirrors the FDA ’s process, this \nwould allow consumers to buy products and understand serving sizes within a framework that they \nalready know and are familiar with from the food and non -alcoholic beverage space.  This w ould also \naccommodate the realities of the types of drinks that consumers are currently havin g or making w ith \nbeverage alcohol in the 4% to 30% ABV range and would minimize consumer confusion over  serving \nsize, especially with respect to ready-to-drink canned products. \n \nAlternatively, if the TTB wants to maintain the serving size reference ranges proposed in Notice \nNo. 237, then another recommendation would be for the TTB to allow an exception for suppliers to \ndeviate from the proposed serving size reference range if they  can demonstrate that the proposed \nserving size does not reflect the actual amount of their product that is typically consumed.  This would \nallow the TTB to maintain the current framework but still provide flexibility for those suppliers whose  \nproducts are typically consumed as one part of a cocktails. \n \nWe thank you for your consideration of our comments.

The listing of ‘fish’ would also be required \nwhen the processing aid isinglass or fish gelatine is used as a fining agent to clarify \nwines and beers. \nAt a global level, in a report  (1) published last year, the FAO/WHO estimated the \nexposure details including gelatine and isinglass in wine and beer. The Expert \nCommittee concluded that for the curren tly accepted exemptions (i.e. in the \nEuropean Union , Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Paraguay) there is an \nestablished history of safe consumption and that the exposure estimates at the \nreference dose - RfD/30 - level appears to provide an adequate marg in of \nexposure for derivative safety assessment. \nThe EU invites the United States to consider the possible exclusion of isinglass or \nfish gelatine as a processing aid in wine and beer from mandatory allergen \nlabelling. \nAs regards the “ Alcohol Facts Stateme nts in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled \nSpirits, and Malt Beverages” notified on 22 January 2025 as G/TBT/N/USA/2182, \nthe EU invites the United States of America to take into account Codex Guidelines \non the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling  (CXG 105-\n2024) and to consider whether some or all of the mandatory information particulars \nincluded in the “Alcohol Facts” could be provided to consumers using technology  \nsuch as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. The EU would furthermore like to \nhighlight that none of the Codex standards or guidelines requires the mandatory \nindication of the quantity of pure ethyl alcohol on alcoholic beverages and that, \ncontrary to the alcohol content by volume, this information is nearly never indicated \non traded alcoholic beverages. \nFinally, concerning the proposed transition period, the EU welcomes the proposed \n5-years. In a similar vein, the EU requests that the United States grants the \noperators a possibility to exhaust all their stock which was put on the market before \nthe proposed rule comes into effect. \n \n(1) FAO/WHO Report – Risk Assessment of Food Allergens; \nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240088924  \n2 \n \nThe EU would be grateful if the above -mentioned comments could be taken into \naccount and replied to before adoption of the notified draft. \n*** \n \n \n \n  \nElectronically signed on 07/08/2025 11:43 (UTC+02) in accordance with Article 11 of Commission Decision (EU) 2021/2121\n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'These comments are submitted on behalf of the European Commission, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (GROW) International Value Chains &ndash; A3.<br/>'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0154,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-09-03 17:50:28,,False,Comment 151:  European Union,09000064b8eef1b4,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the European Commission, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (GROW) International Value Chains &ndash; A3.<br/>",me1-yppw-c4ct,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,European Union,,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,1,2025-09-05 01:04:48,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,28,"[28, -1, -1]",28,-1,-1

The KDA is comprised of seventy-two distilled spirits\nproducers licensed and permitted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the KDA and\nits membership is thankful for the opportunity to provide high-level comments on\npotential labelling changes for nutritional and allergen information on spirits packaging.\nWhile the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (""TTB"") has issued two\nnotices of proposed rulemaking on complex labeling changes, we are choosing to submit\ncomments to both under a unified response as these issues are directly linked and raise\nsimilar concerns for Kentucky\'s spirits industry. Please accept the following as the\nKDA\'s comments relative to both Docket TTB-2025-002 (Notice No. 237) and Docket\nTTB-2025-003 (Notice No. 238), relating to proposed changes to TTB regulations to\nrequire the inclusion of alcohol fact and major food allergen statements on labels of\ndistilled spirits.\nSince the KDA\'s founding in 1880, our mission has been to passionately and\nresponsibly promote, protect and elevate Kentucky\'s signature Bourbon and Distilled\nSpirits Industry. We produce an estimated ninety-five percent (95%) of the world\'s\nsupply of Bourbon and our members have operations across the spirits categories. As\nsuch, significant changes to current regulations would have an outsized financial and\nadministrative impact on our members.\nLaw Offices: Lexington I Louisville I Frankfort\nGovennment Affains: Frankfont\nmcbnayenf inm.comMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 2\n1. Increased Cost Burden to Producers\nThe KDA requests that TTB recognize that, first and foremost, the costs\nassociated with the proposed label changes would be significant for large and craft\nproducers alike. Nutritional sampling and testing would add substantial expense to\ndistilling operations and be unduly burdensome for smaller distillers who lack the staff\nand capital to add this process. Additionally, reformatting and reprinting labels would be\nan expensive undertaking. With our members producing so many different stock keeping\nunits (""SKUs""), these costs would be astronomical right out of the gate and the continued\ntesting would be cost prohibitive.\nIt is also important to note that so much information is already federally mandated\nto be on spirits labels. Significant and meaningful data is already provided on spirits\nlabels, and any additions must balance consumer demand for information with economic\nand logistical considerations, such as testing costs, limited labeling space, and expensive\npackaging changes. Consumers trust what is labeled now and additional labeling real\nestate devoted to unnecessary information might confuse the public, or worse, have them\nignore key labeling information altogether.\n2. Alcohol Fact Statement Creating Confusion\nThe proposed requirements for the Alcohol Facts statement also introduces\nredundancy to existing labeling requirements by requiring the percentage of alcohol by\nvolume (""ABV"") be restated on the Alcohol Facts statement, in addition to the\nrequirement that ABV be presented on the front label. However, the proposal goes further\nby requiring that the total quantity of pure ethyl alcohol be stated in fluid ounces as well,\nwhich will result in customer confusion.\nCustomers are not used to seeing the quantity of alcohol in a beverage being\nquantified in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. By redundantly including the ABV on\nthe Alcohol Facts statement in combination with a new measurement of quantity of\nalcohol in a product, customers will be confused if those measurements are in conflict or\nmisinterpret the label entirely.\nFurther, as identified by TTB in Notice No. 238, the distillation process removes\nproteins and the resulting spirits are therefore devoid of proteins. Yet, the proposed\nAlcohol Facts statement would require distilled spirits to state the amount of protein in\nthe product, which will be zero. This would create customer confusion as a customer\nwould reasonably assume that seeing protein on a bottle of distilled spirits means that\nthere are some distilled spirits that do contain proteins.\ntMtrBRAYER\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 3\nThe KDA does not support the proposed Alcohol Facts statement as proposed due\nto the inclusion of the fluid ounces of pure alcohol and proteins.\n3. Digital Labeling Options\nSpirits labels currently carry an abundance of consumer information. As\ndiscussed, to keep consumers\' attention and give them the ability to learn more about\ncertain products, a digital label or QR code would be a widely-accepted solution. Such\nan approach would boost consumer confidence in the product and give buyers an easy\n\'click through\' for the latest and more in-depth product information.\nMoreover, digital labeling supports sustainability by reducing the need for\nprinting new labels every time regulations change, which can have significant\nenvironmental impacts. The widespread use of smartphones in the U.S. (with almost\nninety-seven percent (97%) ownership) makes digital labeling a practical solution for\nhelping consumers make informed choices about dietary information while having less\nenvironmental effects.\n4. Major Allergens and the Distillation Process\nAs TTB properly observed, the distillation process removes all proteins -\nincluding gluten - and major allergens from the resulting spirits. The end result of a\nproper distillation produces an entirely gluten and allergen free spirit. Because distilled\nspirits do not contain allergens or gluten post-distillation, the KDA supports the\nexception provided for in proposed 27 CFR $ 5.75(bX2) specifically exempting distilled\nspirits from disclosing allergens or proteins, unless allergens or proteins are introduced\npost-distillation.\nThe KDA would suggest that the inclusion of language in the exemption\nregarding TTB\'s testing of distilled spirits clarify that such testing will be on a case-by-\ncase basis, and not create a regulatory burden for distilled spirit plants and the TTB itself\nby requiring lab analysis of every product.\nIf the proposed exception for distilled spirits is not included in the final\nrulemaking, then the KDA opposes the requirement to disclose allergens and proteins due\nto the scientific fact that protein and allergens are removed from the final distillation\nproduct. Adding protein, not to mention other ingredients, to spirits labels would cause\ntremendous consumer confusion-particularly those consumers who are trying to be\n\'gluten-free\' due to diet or health concems. These consumers might not be aware about\ngluten being removed from distillation and may misread bottles containing mash bill\ninformation or just protein on the nutrition label and assume it is not safe to consume.\nIncluding more language on already crowded distilled spirit labels will only amplifu theMEElRAYERI\nRegulations and Rulings Division\nAlcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau\nAugust 8,2025\nPage 4\npotential to confuse customers while creating misunderstanding among potential\ncustomers.\n5. Conclusion\nAs TTB considers additional labeling and allergen information, it is important to\nconsider how highly regulated the spirits industry already is. From traditional regulations\nthat consumers know and trust like the standards of identity that codifu Bourbon and\nother spirits, to proof, age-requirements, and government warning labels, consumers are\nalready well-educated about distilled spirits products.

FEVS's \nmembership comprises around 600 companies, international corporations as well as small businesses, with \nexports around 15.6 billion Euros in 2024 ($ 16.2 billion). The United States is the largest market in value for \nFrench wine and spirits exports worldwide (€3.8 billion / $3.9 billion). \n \nFEVS and its members are committed to providing wines and spirits in all price ranges to the American \nconsumers, while ensuring that consumers are provided with adequate information as to the identity and \nquality of the wines and spirits they purchase. \n \nTherefore, FEVS is pleased to provide the following comments on TTB’s proposed rulemaking. \n \n \nOn the title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nFEVS encourages TTB to adopt the tile “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts”, as the proposed content \nof the statement refers to nutrition information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverage, rather than \ninformation on alcohol. Therefore, the title “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest that \nthe statement includes general indication on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. \n \nIn addition, consumers are accustomed to the title “ Serving Facts” and to the fact that this is related to \nnutrition information of the beverage they intend to purchase or consume, since most operators who \ncurrently voluntarily disclose nutrition information use “ Serving Facts ”, as acknowledged by TTB in the \nNotice. As a consequence, choosing the “ Serving Facts” title would also limit costs of re -labelling for these \noperators. \n \nLastly, FEVS believes that the similarity between “ Serving Facts”, which could apply to alcoholic beverages \nregulated under IRC, and “ Nutrition Facts”, required for alcoholic beverages regulated under FDA rules, is \nmore beneficial to consumers as it ensures a kind of coherence on how the nutrition information is provided \nfor all products proposed for sale on the market – even if the content of their respective statement may differ \nas proposed by TTB for the former. \n \n2 \nOn the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nFEVS thanks TTB to take into account particularities of the wines and spirits production process and sector \nby proposing a content of a nutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what \nis required for other food products through the FDA Nutrition Facts label. \n \nNevertheless, FEVS would like to underline that wine or spirits do not contain fat or proteins and is wondering \nwhether the compulsory presence of these two elements in a n Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \nwould provide useful information to consumers when choosing which alcoholic beverage they want to \npurchase or drink. Whether TTB decides to keep these two elements and considering the limited space of \nwine and spirits labels, FEVS suggests allowing operators to replace these two lines by a unique sentence like \n“Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the Statement. \n \nFEVS takes note of the voluntary sugar content  statement as proposed by TTB. In case operators choose to \nindicate it, FEVS kindly requests TTB to clarify how precisely they will have to label it and how the articulation \nwith the carbohydrates content TTB intends to require will have to be made. \n \nMore globally, FEVS would like to raise the attention of TTB regarding the difficulty adding other elements \nto the content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, including through a voluntary approach, \nbecause of: \n• the non-relevance of nutrients like sodium, cholesterol, saturated fat… for alcoholic beverages, \n• the risk introducing nutrients like vitamins or minerals or percentage of the daily value may lead to \nunintended alcohol consumption behaviors, \n• the fact that the more information is added within the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, the \nmore the impact of the most relevant ones for consumers, notably calories, will be diluted, \n• the limited space available on wine and spirits packaging (compared to other food products), \n• the difficulty for operators to put in place the full traceability, risk assessment and analytical procedures \nto guarantee the loyalty and accurate content of such information, \n• the possible impact of such requirement on a trade perspective, for products imported into the US as \nwell as for US wine and spirits exported to third countries. \n \nIn case TTB is willing to require or to give operators the possibility to include additional elements in the \nAlcohol Beverage Information Statement, FEVS strongly encourages TTB to allow this statement to be \nprovided by electronic means like QR-Code (see below). \n \nFinally, FEVS welcomes the tolerance of 20% above or below proposed by TTB as well as the use of “typical \nvalue” charts in order to ease the ability of wine and spirits operators, especially SMEs, fulfilling the envisaged \nrequirements. FEVS strongly encourages TTB to work as far as possible with US trade partners to develop a \ncoordinated approach on these “typical values”. \n \nFEVS would like also to stress the importance of including in the TTB regulation the notion of  “average \nvalues” a s defined by Codex Alimentarius for the nutrition declaration\n1. Being complementary to \ntolerances, “average values” would allow operators to provide accurate information to consumers while \navoiding the re-labelling of their products each year because of crops or evolution of the production method. \n \n \nOn the alcohol content statement \n \nFEVS takes note of the TTB proposal requiring an alcohol content statement, expressed as a percentage of \nalcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverages products, as well as an indication of this statement \n \n1 See Point 3.5 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling: “The values used in nutrient declaration should be weighted average values \nderived from data speciﬁcally obtained from analyses of products which are representative of the product being labelled.” 3 \nwithin the existing  tolerances (in substitution of an indication in terms of ranges). This is aligned with EU \nrules and will ensure consistency in the presentation of products regardless of their alcohol content. \n \nFEVS would also appreciate whether TTB could clarify if this requirement would apply to non-alcoholic wines \n(less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) sold on the US market, too. \n \nOn the other hand, FEVS asks TTB not to require the inclusion of the alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement. While practical modalities regarding the placement of the alcohol content may differ \nbetween malt beverages, distilled spirits or wines, c onsumers are used to find this information in the same \nfield of vision of other compulsory particulars. In addition, under current TTB regulations, the alcohol content \nhas to be labelled in a bigger type size than other compulsory information. Therefore, FEVS does not see why \nincluding alcohol content in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement, among several other elements \nrelated to the product, will guarantee a better visibility or understanding for consumers. \n \nIf TTB want s nevertheless going forward on this, FEVS kindly recommends proposing it as an option for \noperators, allowing them the possibility either to indicate the alcohol content as it is today or to include it in \nthe Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. \n \nFEVS would also like to share concerns regarding the compulsory indication of the alcohol content in fluid \nounces of pure alcohol. Firstly, concept of pure alcohol is not always well understood by consumers. Thus, \nproviding this information without context would not necessarily empower consumers to make informed \nchoices or to understand why and how it differs from the alcohol content expressed in volume by alcohol.  \nSecond, FEVS notes that TTB is allowing operators, in addition to these two elements, to indicate the alcohol \ncontent in degrees of proof ; meaning the same information could appear in three different forms in the \nAlcohol Beverage Information Statement. \n \nBeyond issues related to limited available space o n labels and to the complexity for foreign operators who \ndo not usually use the fluid ounces of pure alcohol as unit of measurement, FEVS fears the proposed approach \ncould lead to an important risk of confusion by consumers. \n \nIn addition, FEVS tends to consider that a “per serving size” presentation could increase the difficulties for \nconsumers to fully understand the elements provided in the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. As \nrightly pointed out in the Notice, serving size reference amounts could be considered  by consumers as a \nrecommended consumption amount rather than a way to determine the  alcohol, nutrient or calorie intake \nof a specific beverage. Besides, since serving size would have to differ depending on  the alcohol content of \nthe product, this will prevent consumers from making comparisons between several alcoholic beverages on \ntheir respective nutritional impact, due to the lack of an identical basis for comparison. \n \nThis approach will also lead to additional complexity for wine and spirits companies, especially exporters who \nare not used to managing serving size and/or will have to manage specific ones for the US market. \n \nFEVS would also like to recall that Codex Alimentarius recommends that the nutrition declaration should be \nexpressed per 100 ml and “in addition, this information may be given per serving as quantified on the label“\n2. \n \nWhether TTB confirms its intention to request nutrition information to be provided in pure alcohol per \nserving, FEVS strongly suggests TTB to allow the electronic display of these elements. Indeed, the presence \nof a QR -Code on a label could facilitate the provision of substantive information on the concepts of pure \nalcohol and standard drinks, including in relation with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans  if relevant, \nwhich would not be practically feasible on a physical label. It  would also reduce the conformity c osts for \noperators, especially those non-US based,  thanks to  automatic calculation of nutrition content of their \nproduct and conversion of the figures into US unit measures (see below). \n \n \n \n2 See Point 3.4.2 and 3.43 of the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling 4 \nOn the Alcohol Beverages Information Statement disclosure \n \nWhile acknowledging the flexibilities proposed by TTB for the display of the Alcohol Beverages Information \nStatement (ie, linear display option and lesser rules in terms of format and size on the panel), FEVS strongly \nreiterates its call to TTB for allowing these information to be distributed by electronic means. \n \nAs previously raised, electronic labelling offers a wide range of advantages to both consumers and operators, \nespecially SMEs. Indeed, this digital mean makes it possible: \n• for companies, to have a tool adapted to the variability of wines and spirits, thus limiting the costs of \nmodifying packaging, while guaranteeing the loyalty of the information,  \n• for the consumer, an easy and permanent access to information (including for people with disabilities), \nupdated in real time and in his own language (in or outside the US territory), \n• for public authorities, to avoid the creation of barriers to trade by facilitating convergence of standards \nand administrative cooperation: \no between the United States and wine and spirits exporting countries, \no between federal regulations and the increasing number of labelling requirements in force at \nState level (e.g. with regard to beverage packaging deposits schemes). \n \nIt also has to be noted that technological challenges (like adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage) or ability to \naccess for particular communities are evolving very quickly, having in mind any final rule on Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement would only apply in more than five years from now. \n \nIn the EU, the labelling of energy and nutrition information and the list of ingredients is compulsory for wine \nproducts since December 2023 and the spirits sector commit to provide these information on a voluntary \nbasis. The EU experience demonstrates the possibility of using the advantages of the QR -Code without \nlowering the ability of consumers to access  key information for their health and for making informed \nchoice. Indeed, for companies willing to use digital means, EU regulations oblige them to indicate the calories \namount as well as the allergens on the physical label, while other information, compulsory or not, are \ndisplayed online, via a direct and free of marketing information link. \n \nFEVS would like to underline how aligning EU and US requirements on nutrition and energy information \nwould be beneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, while allowing each party to keep \nits own preference on the content of the information to be provided according to its respective context. This \nwould also allow the EU  and US to set a global standard which could support the development of digital \ntechnologies and avoid trade barriers in third countries market. \n \nIn the case of physical labelling, FEVS requests to remove the black box around the Alcohol Beverage \nInformation Statement, especially when provided in a linear format . This appear not to be proportionate \nor justified as the title “ Serving Facts” in bold type on a defined space which is a label is sufficient to allow \nconsumers to easily locate the information on the packaging. \n \nOn the implementation period \n \nFEVS welcomes the proposed 5-year transition period as well as the exemption from requiring new COLA \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the statement. \n \nIn addition, FEVS kindly requests an unlimited inventory exhaustion clause which would allow operators to \nput on the US market products labelled in accordance with the current rules but before the entry into force \nof any compulsory labelling requirement of major food allergens. \n \nFinally, if TTB adopt s a final rule on Major Food Allergens labelling (as envisaged in Notice  of proposed \nrulemaking No. 238), FEVS asks for an identical date of entry into force for both regulations . This will \nprevent operators changing their label twice, with the disproportionate cost this approach could have for \nthem, especially for SMEs.

If most alcohol beverages contain only minimal or negligible amounts of sugar, requiring its inclusion would provide little added value to consumers. Similarly, we agree with TTB’s assessment that sodium and other micronutrients should not be included, and we believe they should not be referenced in the proposal at all.*\n\n*We believe that including daily value percentages for nutrients on alcohol beverage labels would be confusing for consumers. Such information could misleadingly suggest that alcohol contributes meaningfully to meeting daily nutritional requirements, which is not the case. Given the fundamental differences between alcoholic beverages and foods, adopting the Nutrition Facts format used by the FDA would not be appropriate in this context.*\n\n*Given that many alcoholic beverages contain negligible amounts of nutrients beyond calories, requiring full nutrition facts similar to FDA food labels could be unnecessarily burdensome and confusing, potentially disadvantaging certain products in both domestic and international markets.*\n\nCalculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels\n\n*We support the proposed tolerances of ±20% and the use of ""typical values"" as a valid alternative to mandatory testing. Allowing broad tolerances and the use of tables or calculation methods to estimate nutrient levels is important to keep costs down and maintain competitiveness. Requiring precise in-house testing or sending products to third-party labs would create significant financial challenges, especially for small producers who make small batches and cannot spread testing costs over many units.*\n\nMandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products\n\n*We have no objections to the proposal requiring an alcohol content statement expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume on all alcohol beverage labels. This requirement does not pose any issues, as it is already mandatory in Argentina to indicate the alcohol content on all wines.

Consumers are generally accustomed to looking for alcohol content in various parts of the label, and the overall impact on their ability to find this information is expected to be minimal.*\n\n*The implications of including the alcohol content within the Alcohol Facts statement should be carefully analyzed to avoid the requirement of declaring the alcohol content in two separate locations on the label. According to the World Wine Trade Group (WWTG) Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling, wines may display common mandatory information (CMI), including alcohol content, anywhere on the container’s surface visible within a single field of vision. This approach helps ensure clarity and prevents redundant labeling. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the agreements established within the WWTG. If the information must appear in multiple locations on the label, this could increase label redesign and printing costs. Additionally, unclear placement requirements might lead to confusion among producers, complicating compliance efforts and potentially increasing administrative burdens. Moreover, having the alcohol content displayed in two different places with differing values could lead to labeling errors and mislead consumers.*\n\nMandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol per Serving\n\n*If it is mandatory to indicate the alcohol content as a percentage by volume, requiring additional information about the alcohol content per serving size or standard drink would be redundant and could potentially confuse or mislead consumers. Providing multiple measures of alcohol content on the label may create inconsistency and make it harder for consumers to clearly understand the actual alcohol strength of the product.*\n\nLinear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information\n\na.

Each consumer, if interested, can evaluate their total intake of alcohol, nutrients, and calories when consuming amounts greater than the reference serving size. The reference amounts serve their purpose by providing a consistent basis for labeling and informing consumer choices without implying a recommended level of consumption.*\n\n*According to Wine in Moderation, the reference consumption guidelines are: up to 2 units of alcohol per day for women (equivalent to approximately 200 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV), and up to 3 units per day for men (approximately 300 ml of wine at 12.5% ABV). Additionally, no more than 4 units of alcohol should be consumed on a single drinking occasion.*\n\nDual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display\n\n*We agree with allowing the option to present Alcohol Facts in a dual-column format.*\n\n*We also support the proposal requiring containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving.*\n\nImplementation Period\n\n*The proposed 5-year compliance period for the new labeling regulations is both adequate and reasonable, as it allows the industry ample time to adapt gradually without imposing excessive economic or operational pressures. This timeframe helps minimize costs and facilitates a smooth transition toward more comprehensive and transparent labeling for consumers.*\n\n*However, a shorter period (e.g., 3 years) could be considered only if the labeling is limited to basic elements (alcohol content and calories) and does not include a broader set of nutrients or ingredient declarations.*\n\n*It is likely that some industry members will choose to begin implementing the labeling changes before the official compliance date. Many producers may prefer to adapt to the new requirements earlier to stay ahead of regulations and manage inventory efficiently.*\n\n*Furthermore, it is essential that new label approval applications (COLA) are not required when changes are limited to the inclusion or modification of nutritional information, such as the Alcohol Facts panel or data on calories and alcohol content.*'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0156/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': 'Comments from Argentina – Notice No. 237: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages\nTitle of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement\nWe consider that the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided inthe proposed \nstatement.\nMandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information\nFollowing the same rationale applied to nutritional information, sugar content should remain voluntary.

This timeframe helps minimize costs and facilitates a smooth transition toward \nmore comprehensive and transparent labeling for consumers.\nHowever, a shorter period (e.g., 3 years) could be considered only if the labeling is limited to basic \nelements (alcohol content and calories) and does not include a broader set of nutrients or ingredient \ndeclarations.\nIt is likely that some industry members will choose to begin implementing the labeling changes before the \nofficial compliance date. Many producers may prefer to adapt to the new requirements earlier to stay \nahead of regulations and manage inventory efficiently.\nFurthermore, it is essential that new label approval applications (COLA) are not required when changes are \nlimited to the inclusion or modification of nutritional information, such as the Alcohol Facts panel or data \non calories and alcohol content.'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See attached file(s)'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0156,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-08 17:53:52,,False,Comment 153:  Instituto Nacional de Vitivinicultura (Argentina),09000064b8ef1e1a,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,See attached file(s),me2-sp49-zute,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,Instituto Nacional de Vitivinicultura (Argentina),,,2025-08-08 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:23,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,0,"[0, -1, -1]",0,-1,-1

As \na globally recognized symbol of Mexico, Tequila has a rich history dating back to the 16th century \nand boasts a Designation of Origin Tequila (DOT) acknowledged by 57 countries. The Tequila \nindustry plays a vital role in Mexico\'s economy, supporting approximately 41,840 agave farmers, \n100,000 distillery employees, and 209 authorized distilleries. \n \nAppreciation Statement: The Chamber of the Tequila Industry extends its sincere gratitude to the \nTTB for the opportunity to submit our comments on this significant matter.

The \nmain objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the \nalcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. \nKey points of the proposal: \n\uf0b7 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is \nproposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: \n1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid \nounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). \n2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. \n3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. \n4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal \nestablishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary \ndepending on their alcohol content. For example: \ni. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) \nii. Wines: \n1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. \n2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. \niii. Distilled spirits: \n1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; \n2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; \n3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid \nounces (44 ml) \n4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. \n \n\uf0b7 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different \nformats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. \n \n \n \n \n \nCompliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register \nis proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. \n \nComments on the proposal: \n\uf0b7 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but \nquestion the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not \nconsidered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-\n006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the \ndeclaration of the product\'s alcohol content. \n\uf0b7 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of \nalcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested \nthat this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, \ndigital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. \n\uf0b7 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, \nproteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as \nif these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius \nguidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and \nthat nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption. \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the \nNutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do \nthe differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  \nmisleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s \nlabeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the \nlisted nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? \nAlternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol \nbeverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? \nOur position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely \nbenefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage \nlabeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels \ncould easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which \nwould only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting \nnutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that \nalcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing \ndecisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. \nFurthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are \nfundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic \nbeverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol \nitself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol \nconsumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as \nsomehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current \nlabeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are \ndistinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, \nwhich goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT \nAgreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers \nto international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly \nrecommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This \nmakes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial \nburdens. \nDigital labeling offers many advantages: \n\uf0b7 Unlimited space to inform consumers. \n\uf0b7 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n\uf0b7 Easy updating as regulations change. \n\uf0b7 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks \nof harmful alcohol consumption. \n\uf0b7 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. \n \nThis approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using \ntechnology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. \nFinally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to \nimplement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for \ndistribution in the U.S. \n2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be \nallowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further \nbreakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \nIt is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and \ntrans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the \nmisconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. \n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such \nas trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? \nThe inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be \nmisle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could \nconfuse consumers. \n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol \nbeverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create \nan erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other \nhealth-related benefits? \nIt is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could \ncreate a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true \nand could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or \nrehabilitation benefits. \nThe General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be \nlimited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them \nas something that improves health or well-being. \nFurthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages \nfrom being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from \npromoting harmful eating habits. \nThe Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition \nby establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, \nrehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. \nIn summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or \nhealth benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such \ndeclarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. \n5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in \nadvertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? \nNo comments on this topic. \n6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might \nconsumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the \nidentity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol \nFacts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated \nwith such revisions? \nThe current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol \nFacts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate \nunnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. \n7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol \nbeverage market? \nThis measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and \ndistributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would \ngo against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical \nregulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives \njustified by member states. \nAccording to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly \nnecessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures \nwould have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased \ncosts associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new \nshipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, \nnew businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? \nThe proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, \nespecially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  \nanalyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply \nchains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. \n9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of \nalcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the \nproposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? \nIt is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade \nin alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to \nconsider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the \nuse of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical \nlabels, while reducing operational costs. \nConclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol \nis sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided \nelectronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant \ncosts, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic \nbeverages in general. \nEnd of the document  '}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'These comments are submitted on behalf of the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, C&aacute;mara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT for its acronym in Spanish).'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0155,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-08 17:48:33,,False,Comment 152:  Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT: Chamber of the Tequila Industry; Mexico),09000064b8eef1f6,2025-08-08 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, C&aacute;mara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera (CNIT for its acronym in Spanish).",me1-yvgk-mej0,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,The Chamber of the Tequila Industry (CNIT – for its acronym in Spanish; Cámara Nacional de la Industria Tequilera),,,2025-08-07 04:00:00,1,2025-08-12 21:42:23,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,-1,"[-1, -1, -1]",-1,-1,-1

Our members include \n31 national associations of spirits producers and 11 leading international companies with a strong base \nin Europe. The United States is EU spirits’ first export market in value, with exports worth €2.89 billion \nin 2024. Many of our larger members also have a presence and production facilities in the United \nStates. \n \nWe would like to thank the United States for notifying the TTB notice “Alcohol Facts Statements in the \nLabeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” to the WTO TBT Committee. We welcome the \nopportunity to comment on these proposals and stand ready to expand on our written comments if \nneeded. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as flexible as possible, and do not result \nin unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while ensuring the meaningful information of \nconsumers. \n \nIn this context, spiritsEUROPE would like to highlight the following key requests: \n• Replace the title of the informational statement with “Serving Facts” instead of “Alcohol \nFacts” to more accurately reflect its content.  \n• Permit the use of digital tools , particularly QR codes , to provide the “Serving Facts” \nstatement to minimise the impact of the new rules on trade, align with existing industry \npractices and self-regulation, as encouraged by the European Commission, and – for wine – \nexisting EU requirements. \n• Keep the inclusion of ABV and the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the “Serving Facts” \noptional, as the ABV is already stated elsewhere on the container and the concept of ""pure \nalcohol"" is not widely understood by consumers. \n• Introduce greater flexibility regarding serving sizes, as they vary across countries and can also \ndepend on the category of spirits and the alcohol content of the product. \n• Ensure both proposals enter into force simultaneously and include a stock exhaustion clause \nfor all products placed on the market prior to implementation. \n \nYou will find our detailed comments and recommendations on these proposals below. \n \nI. Comments on the “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages” \n1. On the Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement \n \nWe believe that the title of the informational statement should be “Serving Facts” and not “Alcohol \nFacts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the nutritional information in a \nserving of a specific alcoholic beverage . “Alcohol Facts” could confuse consumers as it may suggest \nthat the statement includes general indications on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. In \naddition, consumers are accustomed to finding nutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement \nbecause most operators who currently voluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the \ntitle.  \n \n  \n 2 \n \n2. On the Display of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) \n \nspiritsEUROPE would kindly recommend that TTB allow the possibility to make the “Serving Facts” \nstatement available electronically, in particular through the use of a QR code. Although exempted to \ndo so by EU law, the EU spirits sector decided to develop an ambitious self -regulatory approach to \nprovide consumers with: \n• (language free) energy information on the back label (per 100ml and serving, in kJ and Kcal – \nas is standard for other food and beverages  in the EU) including the number of portions per \ncontainer; and \n• the full nutrition al information (including fat, carbohydrates and protein) via the scanning a \nQR code present on the back label. \n \nThe latest report published on 18 June 2024  shows that the share of spirit  drinks bottles complying \nwith the self-regulatory commitment on the provision of consumer information has grown from 0% to \n70% in just 5 years. \n \nCompanies are also increasingly mirroring this approach outside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. \n \nWhile this approach is a self -regulatory commitment for the spirits sector in the EU, it is a legal \nrequirement for the wine sector since 8 December 2023, including for US wine bottles exported to the \nEuropean Union. Aligning EU and US requirements on nutritional and energy information would be \nbeneficial for economic operators on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since EU requirements for \nwine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well beyond the EU. \n \nOn the other hand, considering the high number of EU spirits companies that provide nutritional \ninformation digitally, having two substantially different systems in the main markets of both partners \nwould create a significant barrier to trade . This would negatively affect both US and EU companies \nseeking to export to the other market. \n \nThe benefits of a single, aligned  approach that combines on -pack labelling and digital labelling \nelements are manifold. Today, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and \nuser-friendly feature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a \nsmart phone or other electronic device.  \n \nIn addition, digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: \n• Digital labels empower economic operators to swiftly update information  and to adapt \ninformation to consumers easily, while reducing waste and costs associated to changes with \ntraditional physical labels, thus promoting sustainability. \n• Recycling information and other sustainability -related information can easily be integrated \ninto digital labels. One such example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling \ninformation for glass bottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible \ndigital labels since last year.  \n• Digital labelling is also SME friendly : craft producers will benefit from being able to provide \ndigital consumer information as it enables them to drastically cut down on labelling costs and \nexplore new markets, for instance thanks to the geo-sensitive nature of QR codes. This is true \nfor craft producers from overseas, who will find it easier to enter the US market, providing \nconsumers with more choice in the process. This is equally true for US craft operators, who \nwill be better able to export to other markets by making use of digital labelli ng to minimise \ndifferences and reduce costs.   \n \nIn the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical label, \nwe would kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by a \nbox. We would like to stress  that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement,   \n 3 \nregulations should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The \nspace available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would unnecessarily \ntake up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in bold type is sufficient \nto allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label. \n \n3. On the Content of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement (“Serving Facts”) \n \nAs noted above, the space available on a label of distilled spirits is limited . We therefore appreciate \nthat the TTB is not proposing to align the “Serving Facts” statement with the Nutrition Facts Label of \nthe FDA. We also welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations. \n \nHowever, in the spirit of facilitating international trade of alcoholic beverages, we would like to \nreiterate our recommendation that the TTB aligns its proposal with the requirements in the EU for \nwines (including US wines exported to the EU) , i.e. to require the provision of energy information on \nthe label and of nutritional information online. \n \nWhether online or on the label, the “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the \nalcohol content statement (alcohol by volume, ABV) . As the Notice  rightly points out , for distilled \nspirits, the ABV is already required to appear  in the same field of vision as the brand name and the \nclass designation. Consumers are therefore used to finding this information on the main/front label. \nParticularly in the case of physical label, space is limited and adding it to the “Serving Facts” would not \nadd any value.  \n \nIn addition, we would kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving \nin the “Serving Facts” statement optional . Providing this information without context would not \nnecessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pure alcohol is not well \nunderstood. On the other hand, the presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the provision of \nsubstantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard drinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary \nGuidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a physical label. \n \nFinally, we very much welcome the fact  that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA \napplications when the only change being made to a label is the inclusion  or alteration of the “Serving \nFacts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the inclusion or \nalteration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” statement in this manner. \n \n4. On the Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts \n \nWe would also welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes.  We believe the \nproposed approach to serving sizes does not accurately reflect how our products are usually \nconsumed. \n \nServing sizes can vary from country to country and vary depending on the ABV of the product. There \nis a wide variety of spirits above 24% and the serving size of a 65% ABV absinthe would be different to \nthat of a 24% ABV liqueur. \n \nIn addition, this approach fails to take into account that lower ABV spirits (such as liqueurs ) are \ntypically consumed as part of mixed drinks rather than as standalone pours. Mandating rigid serving \nsizes based solely on ABV thresholds may mislead consumers and conflict with customary serving \npractices and supplier recommendations. For instance, liqueurs and cordials often recommended in 2 \noz (60 ml) pours could be inaccurately represented by a 5 oz (150 ml) serving size under the proposed \nrules. This misalignment risks confusing consumers, undermining brand integrity, and inadvertently \nencouraging higher alcohol and calorie consumption. \n  \n 4 \nThe proposed approach also fails to account for the rapidly growing Ready -to-Drink (RTD) category, \nwhere products with very similar profiles but slightly different ABVs (e.g., 7% vs 8%) could be subject \nto inconsistent and confusing serving size declarations. \n \nRather than enforcing a one -size-fits-all mode l, we urge TTB to allow producers flexibility in \ndetermining an appropriate serving size reflective of how the product is intended to be enjoyed. This \ncould be done by retaining the current serving size guidelines as optional defaults, while also \npermitting customised serving sizes where justified by product type and consumption patterns. This \nflexible approach would provide consumers with more accurate and meaningful information while \nallowing producers to maintain control over their product presentation and brand integrity. \n \n5. On the Proposed Implementation Period \n \nspiritsEUROPE welcomes the proposed transition period of 5 years. Given the current economic \nclimate for our sector, a shorter period is likely to present difficulties for our members. \n  \nWe would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock which was put on \nthe market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of our products can often \nbe slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. \n \nFinally, we would also like to request that if the proposed rulemaking Notice No. 238: Major Food \nAllergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages is adopted, that its entry into force is \naligned with that of Notice No. 237 Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages.

As an \norganization dedicated to developing global standards, GS1 US understands the importance of \nleveraging data and technology to improve transparency and enhance consumer access to detailed \nproduct information that supports informed decision making. We commend TTB’s commitment to \nthese goals and are grateful for the opportunity to contribute our insights. \n \nFor over 50 years, GS1 Standards have helped companies power their supply chains to deliver \nsafe, consistent, authentic, and trusted experiences. Best known as the recognized source for UPC \nbarcodes, GS1 creates the common language that helps companies and their trading partners \nidentify, capture, and share trusted data that links their physical and digital supply chains. Millions \nof businesses around the world power commerce with GS1 Standards, and more than 300,000 \nmembers across 25 industries turn to GS1 US for help. This includes the food and beverage \nproduction, foodservice, and retail grocery sectors in the United States. \n \nAs a member-governed organization, GS1 US actively brings businesses together to identify \nindustry challenges and build consensus on best practices for solving them by leveraging global \nstandards. These practices can meet an existing need and guide the development of new global \nstandards when necessary. Beyond operational efficiencies for trading partners, GS1 Standards \nhelp empower consumers to make informed choices and trust their purchases by facilitating access \nto the information they want and need about those products. \n \n2D Barcodes: Enhancing Transparency in Alcohol Labeling \nGS1 US recognizes the importance of enhancing transparency and providing consumers with \nessential information about the alcohol beverages they consume. Implementing GS1 Standards, \nparticularly the use of 2D barcodes, like QR codes or GS1 DataMatrix barcodes, can significantly aid \nin achieving these goals. Linear 1D barcodes, such as the UPC barcode, can only hold a limited \namount of information, typically just a product identifier. In contrast, 2D barcodes are capable of  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  2 \nstoring much more data, including detailed product information, batch numbers, expiration dates, \nvintage, age, and more. This increased capacity makes 2D barcodes ideal for providing \ncomprehensive information in a compact format. \n \nIncorporating 2D barcodes linked to the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) – the globally unique \nproduct identifier embedded in UPCs today - can effectively support consumer access to detailed \nnutrition information. The food and beverage industry has already demonstrated the viability and \nconsumer value of digital transparency tools through the adoption of SmartLabel, a platform \nlaunched in 2015 to provide detailed product information via QR codes, which leverage GS1 \nStandards. This approach is in line with food industry initiatives like SmartLabel® and promotes \nconsumer engagement, transparency, and informed decision making. This digital approach can \nwork in tandem with the required physical label disclosures, enhancing the essential information \npresented to consumers. It not only meets the transparency goals of the proposed rule but also \nenables future enhancements, including ingredient disclosures, allergen declarations, information \nregarding sustainability practices, or responsible consumption messaging.  \n \nA GS1 Digital Link enabled QR code can provide consumers with access to detailed product and \nnutritional information, including allergens and dynamic data such as recalls or safety alerts, \nthrough a simple smartphone scan. In addition to enhancing consumer access to product and \nnutritional information, 2D barcodes encoded with a product’s GTIN offer a standardized and \ninteroperable format, ensuring accuracy and consistency across retail and digital platforms.  \nIncluding the GTIN in a QR code with GS1 Digital Link enables direct access to online product \ninformation. This transforms GS1 identifiers, such as the GTIN, into gateways to consumer \ninformation, aiding effective decision making and strengthening brand loyalty while improving \nsupply chain traceability. \n \nMoreover, the 2D barcode approach is attractive to brand owners because it frees up valuable label \nspace. QR codes are typically smaller than traditional UPC barcodes, yet they have a greater \ncapacity for information. This makes them ideal for compact labels while still providing \ncomprehensive data. Moreover, QR codes are consumer-friendly, as most consumers are already \nfamiliar with scanning them to access key product information. An estimated 90% of American \nadults use smartphones; in our own research, 66% of respondents said that they would scan a QR \ncode to access product information. The growing move to 2D barcodes and QR codes empowers \nconsumers to easily learn more. For further details, you can access the full press release here. \n \n \nApplication of GS1 Standards for Enhanced Consumer Information \nGS1 Standards offer a consistent, standardized framework for globally unique product identification \nand efficient data sharing across various platforms. Utilizing these open standards can significantly \nenhance consumer access to detailed product information. These principles can be applied to \nsupport industry compliance with Alcohol Facts requirements: \n \n1. Identification: GS1 Standards enable the unique identification of products, logistics units, \nparties, locations, assets, documents, and relationships across the supply chain—from the  \n \nwww.gs1us.org  3 \nmanufacturer to the consumer. These identifiers provide a standardized method to \nrecognize and track items, ensuring consistency and accuracy in product information. \n2. Capture: GS1 Standards offer means to capture data about products through technologies \nsuch as barcodes and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This data includes critical \ninformation like expiry dates, batch/lot numbers, and other key attributes. Accurate \ncapture of product information ensures that consumers receive up-to-date, relevant details. \n3. Share: Transmitting the captured data between trading partners using standardized data \nformats allows for seamless information exchanges across the supply chain. This \ntransparency helps provide clear and consistent information to consumers, enhancing their \nconfidence in the products they purchase. Additionally, it promotes consumer safety by \nfacilitating efficient recalls and providing timely alerts about product issues. \n \nConclusion \nIncorporating standards-based solutions such as GTIN identification, 2D barcodes, and GS1 Digital \nLink into the TTB’s Alcohol Facts labeling framework offers a powerful path to enhance consumer \naccess to accurate, comprehensive information. These tools not only help industry stakeholders \nefficiently meet disclosure requirements but also position them to adapt to future advancements in \nthe digital marketplace. GS1 US remains committed to working collaboratively with TTB, industry \npartners, and other stakeholders to support the successful implementation of this important \ninitiative. Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to the opportunity to \ncontribute to a more transparent, informed, and trusted marketplace for alcohol beverage \nproducts. \n \n \nSincerely,\u202f\u202f  \n\u202f  \nMaggie Lyons  \nVice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs  \n ""}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'GS1 US Comments on TTB Proposed Rule - Alcohol Facts Statement Labeling '}]",TTB-2025-0002-0168,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-13 23:23:09,,False,Comment 165:  GS1 US,09000064b8efb38b,2025-08-13 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,GS1 US Comments on TTB Proposed Rule - Alcohol Facts Statement Labeling ,mea-4prg-nm4z,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-08-13 04:00:00,1,2025-08-15 13:38:36,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,27,"[27, -1, -1]",27,-1,-1

Ryan Administrator Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulations and Rulings Division 1310 G Street, NW, Box 12 Washington, DC 20005    Dear Ms. Ryan,   Alcohol Justice is a nonprofit based in San Rafael, CA, dedicated to promoting evidence-based policies that protect public health and safety. We would like to offer the following comments on the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposed rulemaking for 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27, Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237.    It is past time for the baseline labeling requirements for alcoholic beverages to be brought in line with those of nearly every other food product. As a consumable product, alcohol is responsible for a substantial morbidity and mortality burden, causing 178,000 deaths per year in the United States, of which 117,000 were due to health complications arising from drinking recklessly over the long term.1 Yet in many cases, consumers have little knowledge about what is in a bottle of alcohol—extending even to how much alcohol, the key ingredient that exempts these products from labeling requirements, the package contains.  The need for these extends far beyond a general intent to support the public’s health. Surveys show that consumers have overwhelming expressed support for additional information when purchasing alcoholic products, 77% strongly supporting more information on alcohol content specifically.2 This information is critical for supporting emerging alcohol consumption trends, which increasingly favor “mindful drinking” that centers intentionality, control, and a deeper understanding of how consumption impacts the body.3 We applaud TTB’s efforts to move forward with regulation that addresses this information gap.  We would like to offer the following feedback to TTB’s specified concerns. We are not addressing all questions posed in the Request for Comment, only those for which we believe we have public health-centered arguments.  Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Sheet  \n1.  “Alcohol Facts” is preferable to “Serving Facts” as it centers the idea that alcohol is not a nutrient and alcoholic products are not a standard part of any diet. It also flags that there can and will be information in that area that goes beyond what would be expected on a standard label, specifically alcohol content.  3.  Consumers will reflexively seek content information in the same place they find it with other products. For the purposes of alcoholic beverages, that would be the white box with specific product contents specified, even if said box is labeled “Alcohol Facts” instead of “Serving Facts”.   4. “Alcohol Facts” would provide some helpful distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, but only for motivated consumers. If drawing a clear distinction is a priority—and with the explosion of “crossover products” that use a known nonalcoholic brand identity to sell alcoholic beverages,4 TTB should be establishing further plans to require clear disambiguation.  Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information  1.  We support harmonizing the “Alcohol Facts” requirements with standing FDA requirements. A large part of this support is based on the principal that alcoholic beverages should not be exempt from simple obligations to inform that every other consumable has to abide by. We recognize the concern about consumers assuming they can get nutrients from alcohol consumption, however the industry already engages in misleading health impact claims.5 The irony is that, at present, voluntary “Nutrition Facts” labels are often used to support these claims, while the relative validity of them is untestable because so many products opt not to have those labels. In this instance, consistency creates accountability.  2, 3.  We support as close an analogy to the FDA warnings as possible, even in the case of nutrients that are rarely found in alcoholic products, because rarity is not the same as a guarantee that a product will not have an exceptional amount of sodium or trans-fats.  4.  So long as the producer is allowed to claim an alcoholic beverage contains any given vitamin or mineral, they should be obligated to attest to the amount that is in the container.  6. Popular support for “Alcohol Facts” is quite high, ranging from 64% for nutritional content to 77% for alcohol content.2 Being able to not only understand that contents of an alcoholic beverage, but to be able to compare them while in the store, forms a core principle of informed shopping—as well as a core principle of bodily autonomy, when you consider the fact that without them most people do not know what is going into their bodies. On a less abstract level, across-the-board nutrient labeling allows consumers to avoid nutrients they wish to avoid, and to verify claims made by manufacturers.  9. Although international regulations are heterogenous, there is no case in which erring on the side of more on-label information would complicate an export—but many cases in which too little on-label information would do so.   Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on All Alcohol Beverage Products  1.  The exemption from alcohol by volume (ABV) labeling for “table wines” creates an explicit health hazard. The range of strengths under which labeling is not necessary creates an inability for the consumer to responsibly track their consumption. The risks from acute overconsumption, when comparing e.g. half a bottle of 8% ABV wine to half a bottle of 13% ABV wine, are moderate but present. The risks from chronic consumption at that level are substantial. While we maintain that the “j-shaped curve” is largely an artifact of poor study design,6 even studies which support that curve find that purported benefits evaporate for both sexes at consumption levels of 3 drinks per day or more.7 With the enormous ranges of tolerance within table wine labeling, it can easily lead to unwitting overconsumption.  3. An increase in tolerance for reported ABV on packaging very easily can lead someone to consume more than they intended, particularly within larger bottles and similar containers. This could create severe health impacts over the long run.  4. Based on the principle that all products sold for consumption should be transparent about ingredients, “non-alcoholic” malt beverages should also be subject to nutrition labeling requirements.  6. A range of content as wide as “7% to 14%” is tantamount to not providing any information about ABV.  It is impossible to plan for one’s alcohol intake when the information given is so uncertain.   Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement  1.  The preferred venue for alcohol content information would be on the front of the label, in large type, in a readily legible font. Having alcohol content information in addition be part of the Alcohol Facts label would still serve consumers well, however.  It would be easy to locate, would facilitate comparison between products, potentially reduce the ability of producers to disguise ABV—or, in some cases, market a clearly dangerous level of alcohol as part of the design.  2. The Alcohol Facts should err on the side of more information and greater uniformity between products’ labels. If a consumer is looking at two products’ labels, and one has alcohol content while the other does not, it increases the burden on them to find the needed information.   Mandatory Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces of Pure Alcohol Per Serving  1.  We stand with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in pushing for standing servings of alcohol to be included on packaging. Every interpretive step a consumer has to take makes an informed decision more difficult. Currently, USDA and other Federal consumption advice takes the form of a standard drink. 8 Unless there is a cross-agency plan to shift advice to center on fluid oz., the current label still creates challenges to advancing the most impactful outcome from alcohol per serving labeling: avoiding dangerous patterns of consumption.    3. Standard drink should be defined and used in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. This becomes crucial when you get to packaging that does not adhere to the sizes used in Federal advisories. Consumers tend to interpret a “drink,” particularly in the case of non-resealable containers, and this leads to persistent underestimation of the amount of alcohol they are actually consuming.9  For instance, a 16 oz. can at 6.9% ABV could be reflexively considered one drink. However, both because of the high alcohol content and the added volume, it far exceeds that, and two containers of this per night would be well over the hazardous chronic consumption threshold. Research suggests that the reflexive assumption of one “drink” per container can be altered through education,10 but for the TTB label revisions to facilitate that, the information must be standardized and easily referenced against an easily memorized standard—which already exists in the form of the standard drink.  In light of TTB’s concerns with legibility, a conservative alternative would be to provide standard drinks within a range, e.g. “0.5–1 standard drink,” “2-3 standard drinks,” etc.  So long as the upper bound is equal to or greater than the actual number of standard drinks, it would ensure that informed and accurate decisions could be made in terms of health impact.   4. The labels should have a definition of “drink,” as well as a commonly accepted, verifiable risk threshold for chronic harm in terms of drinks per day, that aligns with and can be checked against a reputable source.   5.  As of this writing, preliminary reports are that the United States Department of Agriculture will not be defining hazardous levels of drinking in the forthcoming dietary guidelines. If this is the case, then we recommend defining highly risky drinking according to definitions set forth by NIAAA or a reputable NGO such as the American Medical Association.   Linear Display, Type Size, and Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information  1.  Linear display of Alcohol Facts should be acceptable so long as it is consistent among containers of that size. Allowing producers to choose between two formats, however, would add to consumer confusion and impede the intended benefits to consumers.  2.  A box is a simple and expedient way to standardize the appearance of Alcohol Facts across producers, which should be the goal. While there are other ways to create a readily identifiable standard, the box makes for a straightforward and unambiguous requirement.  3.  We also strongly urge TTB to adopt dimensional limits on type beyond simply font size, since poor kerning or highly condensed fonts (such as those used in the legacy health warning on alcoholic beverages) are extremely difficult to read.  7. Anything other than putting ingredients, nutrition facts, servings per package, and standard drinks per package directly on the bottle is a mistake. QR codes suffer from a number of shortcomings.  First, there are equity concerns about labels that are only visible via smartphone. They assume consumers own smartphone, which, although common, are expensive products and not universal.11 They assume regular access to cellular connection. And they create an additional burden on the consumer to access and compare the information they are seeking. These burdens are not distributed equally, but tend to disproportionately impact individuals in rural areas, those with lower socioeconomic status, and older consumers.   There is a secondary concern that the chain of custody for the Alcohol Facts data becomes increasingly baroque as we begin adding in digital storage. This creates inaccuracies and accountability issues, which not only risk discouraging consumers seeking good information, but in making audits and corrections increasingly more difficult.   Lastly, Alcohol Facts through QR codes contain no guarantees that consumers would not, for instance, have to provide contact information, or be protected from cookies and other web traffic monitoring being enabled on their devices. The simple act of enjoying a consumer’s right to know should never be a channel for surreptitious information harvesting, especially when it regards products for which aggressive, targeted marketing can create serious psychological and physical problems for the consumer.   QR codes, in short, build sizable, gratuitous walls between consumers and the information they deserve, and make consumers more vulnerable to predatory marketing.   9. Electronic disclosure should not be allowed. If it were, however, information with immediate consequences to health should still be on the bottle, including alcohol content, standard drinks, and sugars.  10. Not only would allowing multiple options create consumer confusion, it would undermine the value of universal Alcohol Fact labeling requirements in validating marketing claims. Once again, producers would put on-package labels for products billed as “healthy” while burying the labels for other products on a website.    Serving Size Reference Amounts  1.  The specified fluid ounce/milliliter quantities on the Alcohol Facts labels will be difficult for consumers to picture.9 A graphical explainer, showing how much of a standard wine glass, shot glass, or beer stein each quantity refers to, would be essential. For some categories—especially the 2.5 fl. oz. and 5 fl. oz. sizes—the ABV range covered within in that serving size creates a large discrepancy in standard drinks. For the 2.5 fl. oz. category, the upper bound is the same as a serving of “standard” distilled spirits.  For the 5 fl. oz., however, the upper bound (16% ABV) would be substantially more, as is 12 fl. oz. at 7% ABV.    All of this would be obviated, of course, by using standard drinks. Failing that, the ABV upper bounds for each serving size should be set to be the equivalent of one standard drink.  3. Any flexibility in serving size should come with the obligation to clearly, graphically describe the quantity of that specific alcoholic beverage being referred to.  4. Standard drinks are the only quantity framing which has utility in empowering consumers to engage in healthier behavior. It is correct to say that this does not reflect the way that beverages are consumed. The outcome from that, however, would not be confused consumers, but rather health-motivated consumers eschewing single-serve containers with excessive standard drinks.   Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Display Panel  1. Dual-column nutritional facts in food products have been shown to influence consumption behavior even in individuals not actively looking to change behavior, with non-dieting individuals eating as much as dieting individuals when given dual-column nutritional details.12 As such, TTB should expect that dual-column Alcohol Facts labeling will result in moderated consumption, not in normalizing consuming more servings.  2. Five-plus serving, non-resealable containers definitely exist in the U.S. alcohol market, and are among the most dangerous products sold. Anything that encourages purchasers to consume less than the full quantity should be applauded, and evidence from food studies suggest that dual-column displays should do that.  3. There should be no upper bound on standard servings per container before a dual-column label is used. The obvious threshold should be the nature of the container itself; if a container has more than one serving and is not resealable, it should be expected to carry a dual-column label.  4. Having a vague threshold of 200% of serving reference size before a dual-column label is required may result in the proliferation of packaging that is 199% the size of a regular serving. The easiest way to obviate this is to set the cutoff at 100%.   Again, we are grateful to TTB for undertaking this effort, and for giving us the opportunity to comment. As public understanding of alcohol risk increases, the demand for accessible, accurate information grows as well. While we feel there are still some shortcomings in how alcohol quantities are being conveyed to consumers, this rulemaking will still greatly improve their abilities to take control of their health and wellbeing. We are at your disposal for any input that might help TTB as the final rulemaking takes shape.   Respectfully,  \n  Cruz Avila Executive Director Alcohol Justice                   \nReferences \n1.

In this spirit, we wish to offer constructive input to ensure that any future labelling requirements take \ninto account the specific characteristics of wine and the operational context European wine exporters to the US. \nCEEV believes that certain elements of the TTB’s proposed approach should be adapted to better account for \nwine’s unique characteristics, limited label space, production variability, and the need for alignment with \ninternational practices, in order to avoi d placing disproportionate burdens on EU wine producers, particularly \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. \nIn this context, CEEV respectfully submits the following key comments and requests for the TTB’s consideration: \n \n1. Digital labelling to be authorized for wine Serving Facts disclosure \nWine is an agricultural product defined by natural variations depending on the characteristics of the harvest. \nUnlike other products, wine is not made to a fixed recipe and its nutritional composition, especially sugar and \ntherefore calorie content, can fluctuate significantly depending on climate conditions, fermentation choices, and \nvintage conditions and cannot be known until shortly before the wine is bottled.  \n \nMandatory physical nutritional labelling would place a disproportionate burden on producers, particularly small \nCEEV contribution to TTB consultation on  \nNotice No. 237 - Alcohol Facts Statements in the \nLabeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages   \n \n \nand medium -sized European wineries where wine is often produced in limited batches, with labels printed \nbefore final composition is confirmed. Requiring precise data would mean repeated testing and reprinting, \nadding significant cost and complexity. For many European wine producers, these obligations could be financially \nunmanageable and may discourage exports to the US, reducing diversity and choice. \n \nWine labels already carry substantial mandatory information, such as origin, varietal, vintage, and legal \ndesignations, within limited space. Imposing additional standardized panels would further constrain label design \nand potentially compromise product identity. \n \nIn this context, electronic labelling offers a practical and effective solution for communicating nutritional \ninformation to consumers, particularly in the case of wine. Digital tools such as QR codes printed on the bottle \nenable producers to provide detailed, accurate, and multilingual information in a format that is both accessible \nand adaptable. Consumers can instantly access this content using their smartphones, allowing for a more \ninformative experience without compromising the visual integrity or cultural identity of the label. \nFor EU wine exporters to the United States, electronic labelling significantly reduces the logistical and financial \nburden associated with traditional on-label disclosures. It allows updates to be made without reprinting labels—\nan essential advantage in a sector in which 99% of companies in the EU are micro, small, or medium -sized \nenterprises. \n \nDigital labelling also supports broader policy objectives, including sustainability and accessibility. It reduces \npackaging waste, enables real -time updates, and facilitates access to product information for persons with \ndisabilities. It also responds to evolving consumer expectations for digital transparency and allows producers to \nshare additional context, such as production methods or responsible consumption messages, without \ncompromising essential label elements. \n \nThis approach is already established:  \n- In the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2021/2117  permits wine and aromati zed wine products  to \ndisclose, under certain conditions, mandatory nutritional and ingredient information electronically. \n- Codex Guidelines on the use of technology to provide food information in food labelling (CXG 105-2024) \nalso consider that mandatory information particulars could be provided to consumers using technology \nsuch as QR codes instead of on-pack labelling. \n \nCEEV requests the TTB to recogni ze electronic labelling as a valid means of compliance for wine Serving Facts. \nSuch recognition would appropriately consider wine and wine production specificities, promote regulatory \ncoherence between major wine -producing regions and facilitate smoother trade flows while supporting \ninformed consumer choice. \n \n2. Serving Facts – title, content and tolerance \nSince their introduction in 2013, the existing voluntary requirements for providing nutritional information have \nused the heading “Serving Facts”.  For consistency reasons, CEEV believes that this heading shall not be replaced \nwith the title “Alcohol Facts”  as proposed in NPRM 237.  \n \nConcerning the content of the Serving Facts, CEEV welcomes the fact that TTB is proposing a content of a \nnutrition statement which is specific to alcoholic beverages compared to what is required for other food \nproducts.  \n \nCEEV welcomes the proposed 20% tolerance level proposed by the TTB for nutritional declaration as it will allow \nthe use of typical values for the nutrition declaration.  \n  \nFinally, CEEV seeks assurance that, considering the proposed tolerance and the minimal presence of fats and  \n \n \nproteins in wine, producers will be permitted either to list these components as “0 grams” thereby avoiding \nthe expense of laboratory analysis for these two substances. CEEV also suggest TTB to authorize operators to \ninclude a single statement such as “Contains negligible amounts of proteins and fat” at the bottom of the \nStatement instead of the “0 grams” indication on the table. \n \n3. Alcohol content statement  \nCEEV supports the communication of alcohol content for all alcoholic beverages.  \nCEEV requests the TTB not to require alcohol content to be expressed in fluid ounces per serving, in order to \nprevent consumer confusion and support harmonization with international wine labeling practices. Both \nnational wine laws and international standar ds, such as those of the OIV, states that alcohol content be \ncommunicated as ABV. Consumers are accustomed to this format across global wine markets and can readily \ninterpret the information provided. \n \n4. Implementation period \nCEEV is in favor of the planned five-year phase-in period as an appropriate timing to allow wine companies to \nadapt to the new rules. \n \n5. Certificate of Label Approval applications \nConsidering the variability of wine,  CEEV is in favor of the proposed exemption from requiring new COLA when \nthe only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the required Serving Facts statement.

The U-label by Scantrust platform was specifically designed to \nprovide economic operators with a reliable and fully compliant solution to meet the latest \nEU requirements on ingredient and nutritional labeling (Regulation (EU) 2021/2117). \nEuropean wine and spirits associations support our solution and assist our teams with \nregulatory monitoring. This partnership ensures full compliance for our clients in meeting \nEuropean and national labeling requirements for wine and spirits. \nScantrust has also expanded its expertise in traceability and anti-counterfeiting systems. \nOur mission is to facilitate access to clear, complete, and reliable information for all \nconsumers, especially in highly regulated sectors such as wine, spirits, food, cosmetics, \nchemicals, and pharmaceuticals. \nPurpose \nThis contribution aims to support the authorization of digital labeling (e.g., via QR codes or \ndigital links) as an acceptable alternative or complement to physical labeling under the \nTTB’s proposed regulations for alcoholic beverage labeling. \nWe believe that the digital solution is fully aligned with the TTB's goals to: \n● Increase product transparency and information to consumers, \n● Provide access to reliable, up-to-date, comprehensive information that \nadapts to regulatory changes (including international ones), \n● Enhance consumer choice, \n● Harmonize labeling standards \nFunctional and Economic Benefits of Digital Labeling \n1) Regulatory compliance \nDigital labeling ensures compliance with labeling regulations across different \ncountries and/or regions of the world and allows adapting products already present \non the market to new regulations. As a concrete example of this, when Italy and \nSpain have enforced, in 2023 and 2025 respectively, new labeling regulations requiring all products to show clear packaging sorting and recycling instructions, \nusers of the U-label by Scantrust solution were able to add these new requirements \nto their digital labels, including to their already existing labels, and show this new \ncontent whenever the QR code is scanned in Italy or in Spain specifically. Reprinting \nof physical labeling elements was not necessary due to the dynamic nature of the \ncontent served and accessed with a QR code printed on labels. \nMore generally speaking, users of the U-label by Scantrust solution benefit from \nstrong expertise and guidance on how to be compliant with the different labeling \nregulations (both existing and future), how to present the information to ensure full \ncompliance, etc. thanks to our partnership with the European wine and spirits \nassociations. The acceptance of delivery of mandatory particulars by way of digital \nmeans as permitted by regulation has been successful in terms of implementation \nand positive sentiment. There is a strong argument for a similar approach and \nregulatory support by the TTB.   \n2) Instant data updates \nDigital labels allow real-time updates of information such as nutrition declaration \nand ingredients list without having to reprint labels or recall products. This also \nmeans that producers can instantly correct any mistake or inaccuracy in a digital \nlabel, at no cost, and with minimum effort. Correcting a mistake on physical labels \ntypically entails a problematic and costly process. \nProcess-wise, labels with QR codes can be printed even before the content of the \nbottle is finalized (i.e. at any stage of the production process, even before the final \ningredient list and nutritional values are known), which, in the case of wine and \naromatized wine products, is often necessary. Unlike other products, wine is not \nmade according to a fixed recipe. Its nutritional content depends on many factors \nand evolves all along the production and maturation processes, meaning that its \nfinal nutritional facts are not known until it is bottled. Thanks to digital labeling, \nproducers can anticipate the labeling process by printing their labels in advance, \nthen simply updating the digital label content with accurate information when the \nbottles are marketed – or at any point afterwards. \n3) Cost reduction and efficiency \nA single QR code can dynamically direct consumers to specific content based on \ntheir location and local regulations. This reduces complexity and printing costs for \nproducers, especially those exporting to multiple, disparate markets. \n \n4) Extended and enriched information \nDigital platforms mean that provision of mandatory or ancillary product particulars \nare not limited by physical space on a label. More detailed product information can \nbe provided: origin, certifications, sustainability, risks, etc. Information can also be \nprovided in a more consumer-friendly way. Including all relevant information on the physical back label of a bottle would mean either affixing awkward folded labels or \nreducing the font size to such a minimum that legibility is compromised. None of \nthose are concerns with a digital delivery. \n \n5) Multilingual access \nDigital labelling allows producers to provide information in various languages, \nthanks to integrated standardized translation, ensuring that consumers can access \naccurate information in their preferred language. This feature facilitates \ninternational market access for U.S. wine producers that are just as concerned with \nproviding their customers with all relevant product details as they are with being in \ncompliance with local regulatory frameworks.  \n \n6) Accessibility and inclusiveness \nQR codes, when combined with mobile accessibility features (screen readers, voice \nassistants, AQR), provide improved access for blind or visually impaired users, while \ntraditional labels fail to effectively meet these users’ needs. \nLegibility of printed labels is a salient challenge too. According to a widely cited \nstructured experiment published in 2011, 61% of consumers presented with some \nsample food labels reported that nutrition information was too small to read. This \nseems consistent with what we know about near-vision changes with age. \nSystematic reviews estimate that 83-89% of US adults over 45 years old have \npresbyopia (PubMed), meaning they have difficulty reading small letters at near \ndistances without correction. \nFor consumers with serious vision impairment, physical labels are often totally \nunusable. In the US alone, this concerns millions of people: about 7 million people (6 \nmillion with vision loss and 1 million blind), according to CDC’s Vision and Eye \nHealth Surveillance System). For these consumers, digital labeling is an opportunity \nto access product information, thanks to screen readers, zoom, high contrast, and \ntext-to-speech functionalities. \nOn the Issue of Universal Access \nSmartphone penetration currently exceeds 85% in developed countries such as the \nUnited States. \nAccording to Pew Research Center’s latest Mobile Fact Sheet published in 2024, \n91% of US adults own a smartphone. Even within lower-income households (below \n$30,000), a large majority of adults (79%) own a smartphone, with 28% of them \nrelying on their device for internet access as opposed to a desktop with home \nbroadband access. A recent AARP survey, updated in November 2024, reports that nine out of ten \nAmericans own a smartphone with 89% of Americans over 50 owning a \nsmartphone, compared to 90% among those aged 18-49. \nThe recommendation is that digital labels are accessed using QR codes as they do \nnot require any specific app—only the camera function or listing of a URL is needed. \nPhysical label content may be damaged or unreadable, making digital tools an \nequivalent or even superior alternative. \nConsistency with international (EU) regulation \nAuthorizing digital labeling in the US would align with the European Union’s \nregulatory approach. Since December 2023, the EU requires the disclosure of \nnutritional values and ingredients for wine and aromatized wine marketed in the EU \nand explicitly allows this to be done through digital labels  using QR codes. Aligning \nthe TTB approach with the EU would provide a harmonized and practical solution \nfor export-oriented producers, while significantly reducing compliance costs. Such \nregulatory harmonization would support international trade, avoid redundant \nlabeling, lower costs for operators, and foster cooperation between major markets. \nIt would also improve predictability for businesses operating in both the U.S. and \nthe EU. \nConclusion \nDigital labeling is a preferred alternative to a strict physical label only policy \nregarding delivery of mandatory particulars for wine and alcohol products. It \nensures immediate, persistent, and universal access to information, which is \nparticularly beneficial for products subject to multiple regulations, and for small-\nscale and/or export-oriented producers. \nData consistently shows high and rising smartphone access in the United States, \neven among older and lower-income adults, seriously undermining the critique that \ndigital information is not readily available to all. Physical labeling limitations are \nalso increasingly acknowledged, i.e. with widespread near-vision and sight \nimpairments that make small prints hard – or impossible – to read and the risk of \nlabel damage that contributes to illegibility or information loss.  \nFor all the above, we kindly request TTB to recognize digital labeling as a valid \nmeans of regulatory compliance for wine and alcohol labeling. Digital labels offer \nprecision, cost-effectiveness, inclusivity, and adaptability—key principles of modern \nregulation.

Our membership \ncomprises 50 leading wine companies and trade associations from 19 countries, collectively \naccounting for more than 85% of global wine production. \nTo support international wine trade and regulatory coherence, FIVS has published a number of \ngood regulatory practice frameworks, including: \n1. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2013) \n2. Regulatory Principles to Enhance Coherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine (2016) \n3. Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) (2025) \nThese documents address a wide range of regulatory issues and have been welcomed by \ngovernments as a basis for more efficient and coherent policy, facilitating trade and ensuring \nconsumer protection. \nIn light of the current consultation, we are pleased to share the FIVS Good Regulatory Principles \nfor Electronic Labelling, which outline best practices for using digital tools to communicate both \nmandatory and voluntary labelling information. We respectfully urge TTB to consider the \nconsumer benefits and efficiencies offered by e -labelling when evaluating new labelling \nrequirements. \nWine has many unique characteristics that derive from the fact that it is not a recipe product, it is \nan agricultural product grown and produced with each annual vintage having unique impacts on \nthe finished pro duct. These characteristics create special challenges for wine producers when \nconsidering new labelling requirements such as the ones proposed in No. 237. Technologies such \nas QR codes enable producers to manage the variations of each annual harvest (and its impact \non nutritional content) while providing accurate, up-to-date information with limited disruption to \ntheir operations . The vast majority of global wine producers  are small and medium sized \ncompanies and this approach is particularly valuable in helping to reduce compliance costs \nwithout compromising consumer access to information. \nIn the European Union, wine producers are already permitted to communicate certain mandatory \ninformation—such as ingredients and nutritional data —via QR codes. FIVS supports a balanced \napproach, recognizing that some mandatory information (e.g., allergen w arnings) should remain on the physical label. E -labelling is not a replacement but a complement to physical labels, \nenhancing consumer understanding and choice through modern, accessible means. \nThank you for your consideration.  \nJulie Hesketh-Laird \n \nCEO \nFIVS \n \nATTACHMENT: FIVS Good Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling \n \n \n \n1 \n \nGood Regulatory Principles for Electronic Labelling (e-labelling) \n14 March 2025 \nThe following sets forth principles and best practices policymakers should consider when \nallowing the use of electronic means for the presentation of voluntary and mandatory labelling \ninformation to consumers.   \nThese principles and best practices build on two previous sets of FIVS ’ “\nPrinciples to Enhance \nCoherence and to Facilitate Trade in Wine ” and reflect growing trends i n the voluntary or \nmandatory disclosure of information via electronic means beyond what is included on the \nphysical wine label.  For the purposes of this document, “e-labelling”, “digital means” or “digital \npresentation” refer to  the voluntary or mandatory 1 disclosure of information via electronic \nmeans such as using a scannable code that creates a bridge from the physical label to the e-\nlabel. \nUse of technology to provide for  the digital presentation of some mandatory information is an \nemerging area particularly relevant to wine producers. Wine is not a recipe or formula product.  \nIn contrast with other food products, the ingredients and related nutritional values in wine can \nvary from vintage to vintage due to variations in climate and grape growing conditions.  In some \ncases, ﬁnal ingredients may not be known until just before bottling whereas the physical label is \ndesigned and typically printed months in advance of bottling due to the regulatory nature of key \ninformation on wine labels and label pre -approvals required in some markets .  The use of e-\nlabels for the digital presentation of ingredients and nutrition information permits the ﬂexibility \nneeded while still enabling product accuracy.   \n \nHowever, the use of e-labels should not be restricted only to this speciﬁc and narrow use.  \nConsumers want more product information tha n can reasonably ﬁ t on physical labels and a \nsingle QR code can serve multiple purposes . In some jurisdictions, QR codes have already \nreplaced barcodes at the retail level\n2 and technology exists for the use of a single QR code to \ntransmit different information depending on the type of scanner used.   \n \nHere are just a few examples of the type of information currently accessible via a single QR code \nas well as potential future uses.  \n \n• Consumers - voluntary product details, sustainability information, product recalls, and \nmore. \n• Retailers - point of sale pricing, stocking, and inventory information. \n• Government Officials - mandatory regulatory information, recycling information, and \nexport documentation.  \n \n \n1 For the purposes of this document, mandatory refers to disclosures that regulations require. \n2 What is GS1 Sunrise 2027? | GS1 US.  \n \n \n2 \n \nQR codes are the most common digital means being used at this time to connect to an e-label.  \nWhile future advancements in technology may lead to replacement s for QR code s, these  \nprinciples will still apply to the use of such replacements. \n1. Use of e -labelling to provide information to wine consumers : \nGovernments should permit the use of e- labelling to provide \ninformation to consumers.   \nRecent work in both Codex Alimentarius3 and the International Organi sation of Vine  and Wine \n(OIV) 4  illustrates the growing trend of the use of e-labels to provide some mandatory information \nfor food products, including wine. The following are just a few of the reasons that support the ir \nuse: \n• Rapidly increasing global penetration of smartphones; \n• Widespread and growing consumer use of QR codes to access information; \n• Consumer demand for more product transparency; \n• Reduced waste consistent with wine industry sustainability goals as the use of e -labels \nreduces label re-prints; \n• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired; and \n• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer - in real time - which is \nnot possible using physical labels.  \n2. Presentation of certain mandatory information  using digital \nmeans: Governments should  allow the presentation of certain \nmandatory information via e-labels.     \nThe European Union (EU) recently took this approach for ingredient and nutrition labelling of \nwine and aromatized wine products5 as did Italy6 and Spain7 for recycling information8 and other \ncountries are assessing the introduction of their use in national legislation. \n \n3Guidelines for the use of Technology to Provide Food Information in Food Labeling as agreed to at the 47th Session \nof the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)). \n4 The recently updated “OIV International Standard for Labelling of Wines-e-label, nutrient declaration, information \nabout ingredients” (amended by resolution ECO DROCON 20-6 76) incorporates many of the FIVS principles. Note \nespecially the ability to use a language -free modality: “The direct link to the e -label indicated on the label may be \nclearly identiﬁed through language free presentation modalities, a pictogram or a symbol easily visible and clear to \nunderstand by consumers.” \n5 EU Regulation 1308/2018, article 119(4).  \n6 Italian Ministerial Decree n. 360 from 28 September 2022 and Implementation Guidelines. \n7 Spanish Royal Decree (RD) 1055/2022 and Spanish Ministry for Environment Interpretative Note. \n  \n \n \n3 \n \nThe range of possible uses of QR codes to present some information digitally is expected to \nexpand over time. Governments should remain flexible and open to allowing digital presentation \nof certain mandatory information as appropriate.    \nThe same general principles of food labelling regulation such as legibility, truthfulness, and \naccuracy should apply whe ther mandatory information is presented on a physical label or via \ndigital means.  \nThese principles recognize that some mandatory information will  always be on the physical \nlabel, such as for allergens. A digital label does not replace, but rather supplements, a physical \nlabel. \n3. Use of QR codes to communicate other, voluntary information: \nGovernments should  permit additional, voluntary information to \nbe presented via e-labels.   \nThe same QR code that links to mandatory information should also be permitted to link to \nvoluntary information, p rovided that  it is presented separately and distinctly from the \nmandatory information.  \nIt may be appropriate to allow producers to include a link on the e -label at the end of the \nmandatory information inviting consumers to “click here” should  they desire access to \nadditional voluntary information.   \n4. The number  of QR codes on a given label should be \nminimized: Governments should permit a single QR code on a \nwine label to serve more than one purpose.  \nA single QR code has nearly unlimited uses. \nIn some jurisdictions, a single QR code is already being used for product pricing at the point of \nsale, to convey mandatory EU nutrition and ingredient requirements for wine, and to \ncommunicate EU Member State specific recycling requirements. \nIn the United States, many food and beverage companies use a single QR code on a voluntary \nbasis to provide information about ingredients, nutrition, and how to properly recycle the \nproduct based on the consumer’s location\n9.  \n \n9 SmartLabel: the leading platform for savvy shoppers to ﬁnd more information than can ﬁt on a package about \nthousands of food and beverage, personal care, household, pet care, dietary supplements, and OTC products.  \n \n \n4 \n \nAllowing a single QR code for voluntary and mandatory purposes will maximize its benefit and \nwill avoid confusion about which QR code to scan for additional information. \n5. Acceptance of standalone QR codes to c onvey information: \nGovernments should refrain from requiring additional text on the \nphysical label to identify the information accessible via the QR \ncode. \nQR Codes provide for a language -free system of conveying important information and \nconsumers are comfortable scanning the codes to access that information.    \nUsing terms next to the QR code to identify the information on the e-label should be avoided  \nbecause: \n• As the use of QR codes expands , the number of possible terms and languages \nneeded to correctly identify the content will proliferate. \n• Text, or other design elements, too close or within the QR code can corrupt the code \nrisking its readability10 \nIf it is deemed essential to identify the mandatory information accessible via the QR code , a \nglobally recognized, language-free symbol or pictogram should be utilized.  However, this must \nnot interfere with the ability to successfully scan the code. \n6. Expiration of e -labels: When mandatory information is \nprovided via an e -label, governments should not require that \nthe information remain accessible longer than the wine is \nordinarily intended for consumption.  \nCodex Alimentarius recently agreed to “Guidelines on the Use of Technology to Provide Food \nInformation in Food Labelling11 that address the timeframe for which producers are expected to \nensure that information that is accessed via QR codes remains available.  The Guidelines apply \nto pre-packaged foods, including wine.  \nGovernments are requested to refer to the Guidelines rather than implementing new or \ndivergent requirements .  H owever, consideration should be given to adapting them in the \n \n10 ISO/IEC 18004:2024(en), Information technology — Automatic identiﬁcation and data capture techniques — QR \ncode bar code symbology speciﬁcation- S ee 5.3.8 “Quiet Zone” that designates the clear space needed \nsurrounding the QR code to separate it from nearby design elements or markings to ensure the QR codes \nreadability. \n11Guidelines for the use of Technology to Provide Food Information in Food Labeling as agreed to at the 47th \nSession of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (para 132(iii)).  \n \n \n5 \n \ncontext of long shelf-life products such as wine to focus on the time period for which the product \nis ordinarily intended for consumption. \nThe final Guidelines at section 7.5 state, “Where mandatory food information is solely provided \nusing technology, the food information shall be available for at least the period, established \nunder intended conditions of distribution, storage, retail and use, that the food would remain \nsafe and suit able for sale, consumption or use. For pre- packaged food that is labelled with a \nuse-by date or expiration date, this means for at least the period up to and including this date.” \n7. E-labels should comply with applicable data  privacy laws:   \nIn formulating regulations for the e-labelling of food products, \ngovernments should take fully into consideration any existing \nand applicable data privacy laws. \nMany countries, including those that allow the use of e-labe ls, have data privacy laws in place \nto protect consumer data or prohibit its collection without affirmative consent. Thus, \ngovernments should remain mindful of these laws to avoid duplication, contradiction, or overly \nrestrictive rules specific to e-labelling.   \n8. Harmonized approach: Governments should work towards a \nharmonized international understanding concerning the types of \ninformation that must appear on the physical label of a wine bottle \nand that which may appear on an e-label.   \nWine is traded all around the world and e-labelling technology is already being used in multiple \nmarkets.   \nIn order to facilitate international trade, g overnments are requested to remain flexible in their \napproach and to consider the best practices already in place in key wine producing markets \nbefore developing regulations in this area.

Ryan \nAdministrator  \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \nAlcohol Labeling and Formulation Division  \n1310 G Street, NW, Box 12  \nWashington, DC  20005 \n \nRe: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages  \n(RIN 1513–AC93) \n \nDear Administrator Ryan: \n \nOn behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I \nappreciate the opportunity to comment on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (ATTB) \nproposed rule entitled “Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt \nBeverages” (RIN 1513–AC93). We commend the ATTB for its thorough review and recognizing the \nimportance of transparency for consumers on serving size and ingredient contents. As the body of \nscientific evidence grows on the impact of alcohol on health conditions such as cancer, it is imperative to \nmake this information available in an easy to comprehend format.  \n \nSince 2013, alcohol companies have printed versions of a facts label on some of their products. This \nvoluntary action lacks uniform guidance, visuals, content, or graphic depictions, and often uses terms like \n“no added sugar” or “gluten free.” These could be interpreted as suggesting that alcoholic beverages have \nnutritional value. The AMA commends the ATTB for promulgating rules with mandatory label \nrequirements that provide consumers with consistent information across products. \n \nThe AMA has long-standing policies on the impact of alcohol consumption on health and restrictions on \nmarketing alcohol to adolescents. Provisions in this rule align with AMA’s initiatives to improve \nconsumer access to reliable health information. The AMA generally supports many of the proposals in \nthis rule and offers some additional recommendations that would further advance consumer protections \nwhen it comes to consuming alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) products, including requiring that alcohol fact \nstatements include a warning about the link between alcohol and cancer, as outlined in greater detail \nbelow.  \n \nNutritional Information  \n \nThe AMA agrees with the ATTB’s proposed mandatory requirement of a uniform alcohol facts \nlabel that includes a standard set of information across all alcoholic and non-alcoholic products. It \nis important for consumers to understand the health impacts of these beverages and be able to compare \nbeverage choices.  \n \nThe AMA supports ATTB’s proposal that mandatory nutrient information statement on labels must \ninclude the following information: serving size, servings per container, alcohol content as a percentage of The Honorable Mary G. Ryan \nAugust 14, 2025 \nPage 2 \n \n \n  \nalcohol by volume and per serving size, calories per serving, and carbohydrates and fat per serving. This \nnutrient information will provide consumers with valuable information about how the products they are \nconsuming will impact their diet and overall health, just as the nutritional facts label does with food \nproducts. This is especially important as the selection of alcoholic beverages marketed to consumers has \nevolved in recent years to include products that are high in added sugars and other additives. For example, \nready-to drink cocktails are among the fastest growing category of spirits, with sales revenue in the U.S. \ngrowing by 26.8 percent from 2022 to 2023.1   \n \nThe ATTB proposes allowing sugar content statements as an optional element and does not propose to \ninclude sodium or cholesterol because they are generally present in small amounts in alcoholic beverages. \nThe AMA believes that sugars, sodium, and cholesterol should be mandatory elements on the \nalcohol facts label. To align the alcohol facts label with the nutrition facts label and provide consumers \nwith essential and comprehensive information, sugars, including those that are added, are an essential \ncomponent. Sugars contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and can exacerbate \nexisting CVD. Alcoholic beverages can also contain high levels of carbohydrates and sodium. For \nconsumers to successfully limit these nutrients, as recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines, this \ninformation must be accessible on labels.  \n \nThe AMA supports consistent labeling requirements for “non-alcoholic” or “zero proof” beverages \nthat are manufactured, packaged, or marketed in a manner similar to alcoholic beverages. \nRequiring that these products have the same alcohol facts labeling requirements will contribute to \nincreased consumer awareness about the dietary impact of these products, which are increasingly \nbecoming a popular replacement for alcohol products.1 Non-alcoholic beverages are also attractive to \nadolescents when marketed as an alternative to alcohol with the same taste.2 This labeling consistency is \nimportant for adolescents to build good habits comparing this type of nutrition information. \n \nThe ATTB proposes to allow for the optional presentation of Alcohol Facts panels in a dual-column \nformat in which the first column would provide the information for the standard reference serving size, \nwhile the second column would provide information about the contents of the entire container. The AMA \nbelieves there would be value in making this mandatory. The dual-column format would provide \nimportant contextual information and ensure that consumers would be familiar with this format as it \nwould be consistent with nutrition facts label requirements.  \n \nTitle and Display \n \nThe ATTB is considering both “Serving Facts” and “Alcohol Facts” as options for the title of the label. \nThe AMA recommends that the ATTB use the “Alcohol Facts” title. This title uses the same naming \nconvention as the Nutrition Facts label. ATTB could take advantage of existing consumer awareness \nabout the use and benefit of such labels by adapting the education and dissemination strategies deployed \nby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and public health groups including the AMA.3  \n \n \n1 Research and Markets.

Ryan \nAugust 14, 2025 \nPage 3 \n \n \n  \nThe AMA understands that the ATTB considered allowing the Alcohol Facts panel to be distributed by \nelectronic means that would allow for limiting the information printed on the product label. The AMA \nrecommends that the ATTB not allow this form of distribution at the expense of complete and \nthorough information on the product itself. While QR codes and websites can be a useful way to \nprovide more detailed nutritional information than traditional labels, research suggests that many \nconsumers may not actively use them—due to factors such as convenience, usability, perceived value, \nand online accessibility.4,5 The AMA supports the ATTB’s decision to instead require that this \ninformation be directly displayed on the product label itself. \n \nTo support greater consumer comprehension of the purpose of an alcohol facts label, the AMA \nrecommends the use of a panel as opposed to linear format. Panel-style ingredient labels are \nconsistently easier for consumers to read and understand, regardless of the type of product, due to their \nstructured and standardized layout6 and consumers are already familiar with this format due to the \nnutrition facts label. \n \nATTB is proposing that the minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements mirror existing \ntype size requirements for mandatory information in the wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverage \nregulations. The AMA supports evidence-based minimum type size requirements to ensure the \ninformation is presented in a clear, legible format to consumers. The AMA also calls for alcohol \nlabeling presented with sufficient prominence, legibility, and design features, such as minimum font size, \nand color contrast, and optional pictorial elements, to enhance readability and support informed decision-\nmaking across populations. To this end, the AMA recommends that the ATTB utilize a multifaceted \nqualitative evaluation process including consumer focus groups to understand which design \nelements are most effective at relaying key information on alcohol beverages. Upon completion of \nthis evaluative process, the ATTB should release guidance/examples and possible rulemaking with \nadditional requirements based on these findings, such as required color schemes and/or pictorial elements. \nThe FDA employed this process in the creation of final regulations for front-of-package nutrition labeling \nand tobacco warning labels. Both were shaped by rigorous, evidence-based research, including consumer \nfocus groups, to ensure clear and effective health communication. The FDA relied on this body of \nresearch to inform its regulations and guidance that empower consumers to make informed decisions and \nadvance population health outcomes.  \n \nCompliance Date \n \nCMS proposes a compliance deadline of five years from the date of publication in the Federal Register. \nWhile the AMA understands the desire to allow a reasonable runway, particularly for small \nmanufacturers, to come into compliance, we believe five years is an unnecessarily long time and would \nrecommend an alternative deadline of two or three years to come into compliance with the rule, which we \nbelieve would provide more than adequate time for suppliers to come into compliance. In any case, ATTB \nshould not finalize a deadline of any longer than five years.  \n \nAdditional Recommendations \n \nThe AMA supports the addition of the following warning statement: “There is no safe amount of \nalcohol consumption, and consuming alcohol in any amount increases the risk of cancer and other \n \n4 Gaudeul, A., & Krawczyk, M.

In \naddition to package labeling, the AMA recommends clear, evidence-based point-of-sale warning signage \nin physical and digital retail environments. \n \nLastly, the AMA strongly supports ongoing research and evaluation into the impact of alcohol warning \nlabels on consumer knowledge and behavior, health outcomes, and alcohol sales patterns, particularly \nacross sub-populations, and that alcohol labeling standards be updated based on the latest in evolving \nevidence about what consumer education strategies are most effective.  \n \nIn Conclusion \n \nOverall, the AMA strongly supports the creation of an alcohol facts statement, which will lead to greater \nconsumer understanding about the associated dietary and health impacts of consuming alcoholic products. \nWe welcome further opportunities to collaborate with the ATTB as it works towards finalization and \nimplementation of these new requirements which will help empower Americans to more easily compare \nproducts and make well-informed decisions.

Box 12 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \nComment on Proposed Rule: Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled \nSpirits, and Malt Beverages (Docket No. TTB-2025-0002) \n \nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) respectfully submits the following \ncomments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB’s) proposed rule on \nalcohol facts statements in the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. CSPI is a \nnon-profit consumer education and advocacy organization that has worked since 1971 to \nimprove the public’s health through better nutrition and safer food. CSPI publishes Nutrition \nAction and is supported by the subscribers to Nutrition Action, individual donors, and foundation \ngrants. CSPI is an independent organization that does not accept any corporate donations. \n \nOverall, we support this rule as a major step forward for transparency on alcoholic beverages that \nwill allow consumers to make more informed choices about their alcohol purchases and TTB \nshould move swiftly to finalize this rule. However, consumers need more information about \nnutrition and alcohol content beyond what has been proposed.  \n \nBackground \n \nCSPI has a long history of advocating for greater transparency on alcohol and has called for \nalcohol content and nutrition information labeling for over two decades. In 2003, CSPI, the \nNational Consumers League (NCL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and 66 other \nhealth and consumer organizations filed a citizen petition calling on TTB’s predecessor to \nrequire a standardized “Alcohol Facts” label (including percent alcohol by volume (%ABV), \nserving size, amount of alcohol per serving, servings per container, calories, ingredients, and the \nDietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) advice on moderate drinking) on all beer, wine, and \ndistilled spirits.\n1 In 2005, TTB requested public comments on alcohol labeling,2 and in 2007, \nTTB issued proposed rules for mandatory “Serving Facts,”3 but these rules were never finalized. \nInstead, in 2013, TTB published a ruling allowing voluntary nutrition and alcohol content \nlabeling.\n4 In October 2022, CSPI, NCL, and CFA filed a lawsuit demanding a long-overdue \nresponse to our 19-year-old citizen petition.5  \n \nThe proposed rule, published by TTB in January 2025, would require an “Alcohol Facts” \nstatement to be present on all TTB-regulated alcoholic products. The proposed “Alcohol Facts” \npanel includes “alcohol content expressed both as a percentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid \nounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of calories, and the number, in grams, of \ncarbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”\n6 It also allows for a sugar content statement as an \noptional aspect of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. The rule establishes “tolerance ranges” for each    \n \n2 \n \n“Alcohol Facts” panel element, including updates to %ABV tolerance ranges and allows the \n“Alcohol Facts” statement to be provided in either block or linear format and in either a vertical \nor horizontal position. Additionally, it sets forth serving size reference amounts, some additional \nformatting requirements/options, including optional dual-column labeling. The rule specifies that \nthis information must appear on-package and that provision of this information solely via QR \ncode is not allowed. \nPosition Summary \n \nIn this comment, we convey the following main points:  \n• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include serving size, servings per \ncontainer, %ABV, and calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in grams. The disclosure \nshould also include total sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, \nsodium in milligrams, percent Daily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, \nnumber of standard drinks per container (instead of the proposed number of fluid ounces \nof pure ethyl alcohol per serving), the conversion between standard drinks and fluid \nounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and specific, actionable moderate drinking advice (see, e.g., \nFigure 1 below). We refer to the above elements as: CSPI’s Proposed Alcohol “Serving \nFacts” Label. \n• We agree with the proposed serving size reference amounts and the proposal that \ncontainers with less than 200% of a single serving should be labeled as a single serving.  \n• We disagree with the decision to make dual-column labeling voluntary. Dual-column \nlabeling should be mandatory to further assist consumers in understanding the contents of \nalcohol products they purchase. \n• We disagree with the proposed 5-year compliance period. TTB should adopt a shorter \ncompliance period of 3.5 years, as this would strike a better balance between providing \nconsumers with information they require and minimizing cost to industry. \n• We agree that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure should be required to appear on-package \nand never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this \nwould place a barrier between consumers and this vital information and specifically \ndisadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology \n(e.g., those who are older, lower income, or living rurally or on tribal land). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n3 \n \n \nFigure 1.

All other products we \nconsume have basic nutrient, calorie, food allergen, and ingredients information.  \n \nAlcohol content labeling is a simple tool that increases consumer awareness of the contents of \nalcoholic beverages\n10 and could potentially impact drinking behavior.11 Many alcohol industry \nmembers are willing and able to label their products, as evidenced by the wide adoption of the \nBrewers’ Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which has resulted in 95% of the beer (by volume) of \nthe top beer brands voluntarily providing nutrition information on their labels.12 \n \nRecent polling shows that the majority of consumers want access to alcohol content and nutrition \ninformation and would find it helpful when making purchasing decisions about alcoholic \nbeverages.13 In March 2024, Big Village’s CARAVAN U.S. Online Omnibus Survey \n(commissioned by CSPI) was administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, \ndemographically balanced to represent the U.S. Census on age, sex, geographical region, race, \nand ethnicity. Of the 1,924 respondents, 1,509 (78%) reported consuming a drink containing \nalcohol in the past year. Of those who reported consuming at least one drink in the past year, a \nmajority said they either strongly support or somewhat support policies to require alcohol \ncontent (77%), serving size (67%), calorie content (66%), and nutritional content (64%) \ninformation on alcohol labels. Arming consumers with this additional information would help \nthem make comparisons between products and could increase competition in the marketplace. \n \nManufacturers are currently allowed to provide alcohol content and nutrition information on a \nvoluntary basis, but uptake is low and uneven across products. CSPI conducted an analysis, \npublished in 2023, of available labels from the top 150 beer brands (of which 65 brands had \nlabels available) and top 100 wine brands (of which 67 brands had labels available) by 2020 \nsales volume. The analysis found that the statement of average analysis, which contains calories, \ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat, was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.\n14 The \nvoluntary “Alcohol Facts” label, which includes %ABV, serving size, servings per container, and \nper-serving and per-container information about fluid ounces of alcohol, was present on only 2% \nof beer and 0% of wine labels. Even when this information was present, on most labels it was \npresented in formatting that poses a challenge to consumers, such as vertical layout (62%), \ncontinuous format (95%), and use of all uppercase letters and a crowded layout (60%).  \n \nBelow, we provide input on selected questions posed by TTB in its proposed rule, with an \nemphasis on the importance of mandatory, comprehensive, on-package labeling. \n \n \n    \n \n5 \n \n2) “Serving Facts” is the preferable title for the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement. \n \nTTB is soliciting feedback on whether the title “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts” best describes \nthe information provided. While either option is acceptable, “Serving Facts” is preferable, as it \nindicates that it is providing per-serving information and has the added benefit of implying that \nthe information may not just be about the alcohol content, but about other ingredients as well. \nThis is also aligned with how consumers are accustomed to finding this information on alcohol \nproducts, as the voluntary statement of average analysis is titled “Serving Facts.”  \n \n3) The proposed serving size reference amounts are appropriate. \n \nThe proposed “Alcohol Facts” panel bases serving size on the serving sizes provided in the TTB \nRuling 2013-2 (see Figure 3).\n4 TTB is soliciting feedback on the appropriateness of these \nserving size reference amounts compared to those in a previous ruling (TTB ruling 2004-1). We \nagree that these reference amounts are appropriate. However, to avoid consumer confusion they \nmust be combined with the requirement, which TTB has proposed, that containers with up to \n200% of a serving be labeled as a single serving, plus mandatory dual-column labeling for \ncontainers with up to 500% of a single serving (TTB has proposed optional dual column \nlabeling) (see section 6 below). These three things combined will facilitate optimal consumer \nunderstanding of the content of each product.  \n \nFigure 3. Serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 \n \nSource: TTB Ruling 2013-2: Voluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wines, \nDistilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages. https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/2013 -2.pdf \n \nThe serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2 are appropriate because they account for the \nfact that alcoholic beverages come in a wide variety of strengths, even across alcohol types. An \nearlier 2004 ruling by TTB, which set forth serving sizes of 1.5 fluid ounces for distilled spirits, \n5 fluid ounces for wines, and 12 fluid ounces for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol \ncontent,15 lacks the nuance needed to account for the wide variety of products on the market. For \nexample, under the 2004 rule, both unfortified wine and fortified wines would have a 5 ounce \nserving, despite the fact that fortified wines can contain up to 25% ABV and have an average of \n18% ABV compared to an average of 12% ABV for unfortified wines.16 While unfortified wine \nis typically served in 5-ounce pours, fortified wines are typically served in 3-ounce pours,17 \nwhich better aligns to the 2013 serving sizes. Additionally, as the 2013 ruling points out,4 under \nthe 2004 ruling, the serving size for distilled spirits (which are in a canned cocktail) would be 1.5 \nounces regardless of %ABV of the full product. But, unlike pure distilled spirits, canned \n   \n \n6 \n \ncocktails are commonly consumed in 12-ounce cans and, by nature of being diluted with mixer, \noften have a far lower %ABV. The serving sizes put forth in the 2013 ruling are the better option \nbecause they account for variations in strength within each alcohol category and generally align \nbetter with how these beverages are typically consumed (i.e., higher %ABV beverages tend to be \noffered in smaller servings). \n \nOne drawback to the 2013 serving sizes, that can be offset by dual-column labeling, is that if a \nconsumer fails to notice that a higher %ABV products has a smaller serving size when \ncomparing to a lower %ABV product the high %ABV product could appear to be the lower \ncalorie option, when in fact it would have more calories if consumed in equal amounts. Because \nthe proposed serving sizes are the best option but will not always perfectly align with how \nbeverages are consumed, dual-column labeling should be mandatory when a container holds up \nto 500% of a single serving (see section 6).   \n \nTTB is also soliciting feedback on making the serving size reference amount equal to an \nalcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, but this does not align with the way in \nwhich these beverages are typically consumed and would be confusing. For example, unfortified \nwine is usually served in a 5-ounce pour, regardless of %ABV. If the serving size for the Alcohol \nFacts panel were made equal to 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, a 7% ABV wine would have an 8.6-\nounce serving size and a 16% ABV wine would have a 3.8-ounce serving size. Even with \nrounding, this might make it difficult for consumers to estimate nutrition and alcohol serving \ninformation for the amount that they are actually consuming. \n \n4) Dual-column labeling should be mandatory and containers with less than 200% of a \nserving should be labeled as a single serving. \n \nWe agree with the proposed requirement that beverages packaged in containers with less than \n200% of a single serving size reference amount be labeled as a single serving. This will result in \nmore containers that are commonly consumed on a single occasion being labeled as a single \nserving. For example, a 16-ounce 4.2% ABV Bud Light\n18 can that contains 133% of a 12-ounce \nserving would simply be labeled as one serving. \n \nIf the product contains multiple servings, the label should also state the number of servings per \ncontainer and dual-column labeling should be mandatory. The number of standard drinks should \nbe listed per serving and per container (see Fig. 3 below). TTB’s proposed rule allows voluntary \ndual-column labeling for containers of up to five servings. This differs from FDA’s dual-column \nlabeling approach, which is mandatory and applies to products containing more than two and up \nto three servings per container.19 Mandatory dual-column labeling is important to prevent \nconsumer confusion that may arise from basing serving size for alcohol on %ABV. For example, \nin Figure 4, both Guinness beers are in 12-ounce bottles, but the Extra Stout has a 12-ounce \nserving size and the Foreign Extra Stout has a 5-ounce serving size due to its higher %ABV. If \ncalorie information is given solely per serving, the Foreign Extra stout would appear to have \nfewer calories, but the dual-column labeling makes it clear that the whole bottle contains more \ncalories. \n \n    \n \n7 \n \nFigure 4. Comparison of Servings, Standard Drinks, and Calories per Container between a \n12-oz bottle of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (left) and a 12-oz bottle of Guinness Extra \nStout (right) \n \n \n \nSource: images from https://www.guinness.com/en-us/beers/guinness-foreign-extra-stout (left) and \nhttps://www.kroger.com/p/guinness-extra-stout-import-beer/0008382023482 (right); tables generated by CSPI.  \n \nTTB should require dual column labeling on products containing up to 5 servings and allow \nvoluntary dual-column labeling on products containing more than 5 servings. Requiring dual-\ncolumn labeling on products with up to five servings is important to clearly communicate the \nnutrition and alcohol content on alcoholic beverages that are often consumed in one sitting but \npackaged in non-resealable containers up to 5 servings. For example, “Voodoo Ranger,” an \nimperial IPA of 9% ABV from New Belgium brewery, can be found in 19.2-ounce cans.20 Based \non the proposed reference serving size of 5 ounces, each can contains approximately 4 servings, \nbut it is not resealable.  \n \nDual-column labeling should additionally be voluntary on containers larger than 5 servings, as \nthis will allow manufacturers to provide more information to consumers. This may be especially \nuseful in rare cases where the manufacturer may have an expectation that more than 5 servings \nare likely to be consumed in a single sitting, such as when an unusually high %ABV beer is sold \nin larger sized cans and bottles. For example, Evil Twin 120 Days Dry Aged Stout is 17.5% \nABV and sold in pint sized cans.21 With a 2.5-ounce serving size, it has 6.4 servings and is not \nresealable. Optional dual column labeling would be useful on products such as these to further \ninform the consumer. \n \nServing Facts \nServing size 5 fl oz (148 mL) 7.5% alc/vol \n2.4 servings per container  \nStandard Drinks: 0.6 per serving/1.5 per container \n  Per serving Per container \nCalories  81 194 \nServing Facts \nServing size 12 fl oz (360 mL) 5.6% alc/vol \n1 serving per container  \nStandard Drinks: 1.1 per serving \n  Per serving \nCalories  180 \n   \n \n8 \n \nTTB asks whether consumers might interpret dual-column labeling as a recommendation to drink \na whole container. A consumer’s decision to consume an entire container may be influenced by \nmultiple factors, including the container design, the environment in which the container is \npurchased and consumed, and product marketing. We are not aware of any studies indicating that \ndual-column labeling independently influences consumers’ risk of consuming an entire \ncontainer, and such labeling provides additional information to consumers, which may be useful \nin informing purchasing and consumption decisions. We therefore find no strong rationale for \npreventing this form of labeling as a voluntary practice. Inclusion of additional information, such \nas the number of standard drinks and the footnote with specific, actionable moderate drinking \nguidelines (discussed above), could further prevent this confusion. TTB could also consider \nrequiring an additional footnote explaining that the dual-column label does not mean that the \ncontainer is meant to be consumed in one sitting. While such a footnote is not required by FDA, \noverconsumption of alcohol has more severe consequences. \n \n5) Alcohol Content Information \n \nMost adults who drink support mandatory alcohol content labeling and believe this information \nis important for making purchasing decisions. As mentioned above, a poll of U.S. adults who \ndrink alcohol found that 77% of respondents support policies to require alcohol content \ninformation on alcohol labels and 90% indicated that it was at least “somewhat important” when \nmaking alcohol purchasing decisions (with 39% ranking it as “extremely important”).\n13 \nCurrently, this information is not required on all alcoholic beverages and when present can be \ndifficult to find. \n \nData from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show \nthat approximately 9% of adults drank in excess of DGA recommendations.22 A literature review \nfound that consumers tend to pour larger drinks when asked to estimate a standard drink, and \nstruggle to use %ABV and pour size to estimate their intake.23 Alcohol content information, such \nas standard drinks, can help improve consumer awareness of the amount of alcohol they are \nconsuming.10,23 \n \na. Consumers need more information on alcohol content than the proposed \nmandatory statement of fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. \n \nThe proposed rule requires a statement of the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in \nthe “Alcohol Facts” statement. Under the current labeling system, if a consumer wants to know \nhow many standard drinks are in a product, they must use the %ABV to calculate fluid ounces of \npure ethyl alcohol and then divide by 0.6. Under the proposed labeling system, which would \nrequire the number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, gets consumers one step closer to the \ninformation they want. However, fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol will likely not be useful to \nconsumers as they are unlikely to know that 0.6 fluid ounces of pure ethanol equals a standard \ndrink.23 In addition, even if the conversion is provided, converting this information into standard \ndrinks still requires consumers to perform division using decimal fractions. A 2024 report from \nthe National Center for Education Statistics found that about one third of U.S. adults tested \nlacked the skills necessary to perform calculations using decimals and fractions.\n24,25 Fluid ounce \ninformation is therefore unlikely to be useful or material to consumers in making purchasing and    \n \n9 \n \nconsumption decisions, particularly if those decisions are being made under a state of \nintoxication.  \n \nInstead, to improve the ability of consumers to understand the amount of alcohol they are \nconsuming, the “Alcohol Facts” panel should include the number of standard drinks per serving \nand a footnote stating, “A standard drink contains 0.6 fl oz of pure alcohol.” This would be better \nunderstood than the amount of alcohol in fluid ounces, as most public health advice is framed \naround “standard drinks,” so consumers are likely more familiar with this concept. When \nstandard drinks and serving size are equivalent (as will be the case for many distilled products) \nthis information could be combined into one line reading “serving/standard drink size” to save \nspace. \n \nFor additional context, the footnote should also include specific, actionable moderate drinking \nadvice, such as the statement: “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults \nwho choose to drink should limit intake to two standard drinks or less in a day for men and one \nstandard drink or less in a day for women (on days when alcohol is consumed)”\n26 in bold, as \nillustrated in Figure 1 (above). \n \nConsumers can only follow moderate drinking advice to the extent they are aware of it and \nincluding it on the label of alcoholic beverages would improve awareness while also providing a \nframe of reference for the standard drink information. Research shows that consumers respond \nbest to a combination of types of alcohol content information. An experimental study found that \nlabels that include both standard drink information and low-risk drinking guidelines helped \nparticipants more accurately estimate the amount of alcohol in a standard drink, the number of \nstandard drinks in a container, and how many drinks could be consumed before reaching the low-\nrisk drinking limit, compared to labels that only included %ABV.\n27  \n \nA combination of mandatory standard drinks, a conversion factor explaining what counts as a \nstandard drink, plus specific, actionable moderate drinking guidelines would best provide \nconsumers with information that they can utilize in purchasing decisions and could reduce the \nrisk of overconsumption leading to alcohol-related injury and death.   \n \nb. The alcohol content statement should be part of the “Alcohol Facts” Statement. \n \nWe agree with TTB’s proposal to require the alcohol content statement be part of the “Alcohol \nFacts” statement. Alcohol content statements are used by consumers to make decisions about \nwhat and how much to drink. When consumers have easy access to this information, they can \nmake more informed purchasing and consumption choices that can ultimately prevent accidents \nand deaths that would have resulted from unintentional excess consumption. As mentioned \nabove, polling data show that consumers desire this information to inform purchasing decisions, \nbut for consumers to be informed they need to first notice and understand this information. To \nincrease the likelihood that consumers notice this information, it should be a mandatory part of \nthe “Alcohol Facts” statement. \n \n \n    \n \n10 \n \n6) In addition to the nutrition elements proposed, consumers need sugar, added sugar, \nsaturated fat, and sodium information included on the “Alcohol Facts” label. \n \nWhen providing nutrition information on alcoholic beverages, it is important to inform \nconsumers of nutrients of concern but to avoid highlighting positive nutrients in a manner that \ncould mislead consumers into purchasing alcohol based on a false belief that alcohol is an \nimportant source of nutrition. Alcohol is a carcinogen, and increased intake increases the risk of \nmultiple cancers.28 Additionally, alcohol consumption at high levels has been shown to decrease \nabsorption of various micronutrients, including thiamine and folate, by changing how they are \nabsorbed in the digestive tract.29 While the main health risk from drinking alcohol is the alcohol \nitself, alcohol is also a substantial contributor to average daily calorie intake for those who drink \nit,9 and can be high in nutrients of concern, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and even sodium. \nThese nutrients to limit should be highlighted to improve consumers’ ability to make informed \npurchasing decisions. However, while positive nutrients, such as Vitamin C, may be present in \nalcohol at times, they should not be included on alcohol labels as this could mislead consumers \ninto drinking more alcohol based on a false understanding of its impact on health. This would be \nconsistent with TTB’s prohibition of any statement on alcohol that is untrue or that “tends to \ncreate a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption.”30–32 \n \nTTB’s proposed rule requires the number of calories, and the grams of carbohydrates, fat, and \nprotein, per serving as part of the “Alcohol Facts” statement. While the proposal is an \nimprovement over the status quo of voluntary disclosure, additional information on nutrient \ncontent is necessary for consumers to make informed choices about their health and should be \nmade mandatory. \n \na. Consumers want more nutrition information on alcohol. \n \nPolling data show that consumers want this information and would find it useful when making \npurchasing decisions. In a poll of U.S. adults who drink (described above), respondents said they \nwould support policies to require mandatory labeling of calorie content (66%) and nutritional \ncontent (64%).13 And the majority of respondents said calorie (78%) and nutritional labeling \n(78%) would be at least “somewhat important” when deciding whether to purchase a particular \nalcoholic beverage. Without the Alcohol Facts label, consumers do not have adequate \ninformation about the content and quality of alcoholic beverages to make informed purchasing \ndecisions. \n \nb. In addition to the proposed requirements for calories, carbs, fat, and protein, \nconsumers would benefit from consistent access to information on total sugars, \nadded sugars, saturated fat, and sodium (discussed in detail below).  \n \ni. Total Sugars/Added Sugars \nTTB’s proposed rule includes mandatory disclosure of grams of carbohydrates and provides the \noption for sugar disclosure but leaves out added sugars entirely. Added sugars information is \nimportant because the DGA recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10% of calories \n(about 50 grams for the 2000-calorie reference diet), whereas there is no limit for total sugars.\n26 \nIn order to follow dietary guidelines, people need to know how much added sugar they are    \n \n11 \n \nconsuming. The average American adult consumes about 72 grams of added sugar per day, about \n40% more than the recommendation.33 Overconsumption of foods and beverages high in added \nsugars is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes34–36 and cardiovascular disease37–39 in part by \nincreasing the risk of weight gain,40 and can contribute to dental decay.41 \n \nConsumers are interested in sugar information. According to the 2019 FDA Food Safety and \nNutrition Survey (FSANS), 71% of respondents said they are trying to reduce their sugar intake. \nAnd when looking at nutrition labels 52% look for total sugars and 34% look for added sugars.42  \n \nMeanwhile, many alcoholic beverages are high in sugar. Winemakers are allowed to add \nsubstantial amounts of sugar after fermentation. As per TTB regulations, added sugar can \naccount for up to 21% of a wine’s total weight.43 And while pure distilled liquor is sugar free, \nproducts containing liquor, such as liqueurs and canned cocktails, can be especially high in \nsugar. For example, a 2.5-ounce serving of the liqueur Kahlua contains 30 grams of sugar44 and a \n12-ounce can of Cutwater Pina Colada contains 32 grams of sugar.45 If these are all added \nsugars, that is over half of the recommended daily limit in a single serving of each. \n \nIf the proposed rule is published without amendment, the lack of consistency with labeling of \nFDA-regulated alcoholic products, which includes added sugars, could lead to confusion. For \nexample, if a consumer is accustomed to seeing total and added sugars disclosed on hard seltzer \nproducts and then sees an “Alcohol Facts” panel on a canned cocktail that includes some nutrient \ninformation but no line for sugar or added sugars, they may assume it means the canned cocktail \ncontains no added sugars or even no sugar at all. Without a combination of carbohydrates, total \nsugars, and added sugars labeling, consumers are not equipped with the information they need to \nselect products that fit with their dietary and health goals. \n \nii. Saturated Fat \nThe current proposed rule requires disclosure of total fat but does not even mention saturated fat. \nWhile the proposed rule provides an extensive explanation of how TTB arrived at other similar \ndecisions (e.g., whether to include sodium and sugar content in the alcohol facts panel), there is \nno explanation of why TTB chose to include total but not saturated fat. The agency is instead \nsoliciting feedback on whether any additional information on fat should be included. \n \nThe focus on total fat over type of fat is misaligned with the DGA, which focus on type of fat \ninstead of total fat. Indeed, in 2015, the DGA stopped emphasizing total fat and changed the \nfocus to limiting saturated fat.\n46,47 The Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory \nCommittee reaffirmed advice from previous years to “limit foods and beverages higher in \nsaturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent of calories per day \nstarting at age 2 by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly [polyunsaturated fatty acids].”48  \n \nConsumers are interested in this information and fat and saturated fat are present in some \nalcoholic beverages. In the 2019 FDA FSANS, 43% of respondents reported that they look at \ntotal fat on the Nutrition Facts label, and 30% look at saturated fat.\n42 While many alcoholic \nbeverages contain no fat, consumers might be unaware that some contain high amounts of \nsaturated fat. For example, Baileys Irish Cream has 7 grams of total fat per 1.7 ounce serving, of \nwhich 4 grams are saturated fat (20% of the recommended daily value),49,50 making this product    \n \n12 \n \n“high” in saturated fat by FDA standards. Cutwater Espresso Martini, a canned cocktail, contains \n14 grams of total fat per 12-ounce can but does not disclose how much of that is saturated fat.51 \nFor both products, this information is only available online with no on-bottle indication that the \ninformation is available. To improve transparency and allow consumers to make informed \nchoices, TTB should mandate that both fat and saturated fat appear on the “Alcohol Facts” label. \n \niii. Sodium \nThe current proposed rule does not include any micronutrients, and for the most part we agree \nwith this choice (see below). However, disclosure of sodium content should be mandatory given \nconsumer interest and the strong need for sodium reduction at the population level. Dietary \nsodium is an important nutrient to monitor due to the connection between excess sodium intake, \nincreased blood pressure, and development of cardiovascular disease.52 The DGA recommend \nthat adults adhere to a 2,300 milligrams daily sodium limit26  but, according to data from 2021-\n2023 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Americans ages 20 and older consume \nfar more, an average of 3,212 milligrams per day.53 Reducing sodium intake by 1,200 milligrams \nper day could prevent an estimated 44,000 to 92,000 deaths from any cause and prevent 32,000–\n66,000 strokes, 54,000–99,000 myocardial infarctions, and 60,000–120,000 cases of coronary \nheart disease.54 \n \nConsumers are interested in this information and may not know that sodium is present in some \nalcoholic beverages. Data from the 2019 FDA FSANS show that 46% of consumers are \nwatching their sodium intake and 49% look at sodium on the Nutrition Facts label.42 While many \nalcoholic beverages have little to no sodium, some canned cocktails contain considerable \namounts, such as Cutwater Spicy Bloody Mary, which has 390 milligrams of sodium (17% DV) \nper 12-ounce can.55 Also, the Gose style of beer is traditionally salted. SeaQuench, a popular \nGose beer by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, contains 105 milligrams of sodium (5% DV) in a 12-\nounce serving.56 Consumers who seek to limit their sodium intake rely on labels to monitor the \nsodium content of products and would benefit from sodium labeling on alcoholic beverages. \n \nc. All nutrition information should be mandatory, provided consistently, and \naccompanied by percent Daily Value information. \n \nAs mentioned above, a CSPI analysis of top beer and wine brands found that the voluntary \nstatement of average analysis was present on 63% of beers and only 1% of wines.14 The option to \nprovide nutrition information voluntarily has been available to industry since 2013.4 It will not \nbecome consistently available to consumers unless it is required. \n \nTTB is soliciting feedback on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at specific \nlevels. The current proposal requires all nutritional elements to be listed as part of the “Alcohol \nFacts” label, regardless of amount. Some producers might argue that because products in their \nbeverage category rarely or never contain fat, they should not have to label fat content. We \nrecognize that many consumers may not expect alcoholic beverages to be a source of fat, outside \ncertain categories (e.g. cream-based liqueurs). However, understanding when a product contains \n0 grams of a nutrient may be informative for consumers seeking to track their intake. One option \nthat could help provide consumers with information while focusing on nutritional elements that \nare most informative would be for TTB to build on an approach already used by the FDA for    \n \n13 \n \nsome nutrients,57 and allow products containing a zero in certain nutrients (e.g., saturated fat, \nadded sugars), to omit that nutrient and instead bear a footnote stating, “Not a significant source \nof______.”  \n \nTTB should also follow FDA’s lead and require the percentage of the Daily Value (%DV) of the \nlisted nutrients (when applicable) as %DV provides context for the amount of each nutrient \npresent. \n \nd. Additional harmonization with FDA labels would not be beneficial. \n \nTTB is also soliciting feedback on whether it should harmonize the “Alcohol Facts” label with \nFDA’s “Nutrition Facts” label and whether numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral \ncontent should be permitted on alcoholic beverages. The suggestions above would help \nharmonize TTB’s alcohol facts label with FDA’s label in part, but the two should not be \nharmonized further. Because alcohol should not be seen as a source of nutrition, it is unnecessary \nto adopt the full nutrient labeling required because, as explained previously, vitamins and \nminerals considered to be positive nutrients could mislead consumers to believe that \nconsumption of alcoholic beverages has significant nutritional value or other health-related \nbenefits.  \n \nThe importance of not emphasizing positive nutrients on alcohol given its known health harm \nwas recently affirmed when Molson Coors settled a lawsuit for $9.5 million that alleged its \nadvertisement of Vizzy hard seltzer as containing “antioxidant vitamin C from acerola \nsuperfruit” was misleading.\n58 The plaintiffs alleged that claim was misleading on the grounds \nthat most consumers already consume sufficient Vitamin C, the amount of Vitamin C added does \nnot provide a proven health benefit, and alcohol consumption interferes with nutrient absorption.  \nDue to the risk for consumer confusion and deceptive marketing of alcoholic beverages as \nhealthy, vitamins, minerals (other than sodium), monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and \nfiber should not be included as part of the alcohol facts statement. \n \n7) The proposed tolerance levels for panel element calculation are appropriate. \n \nWe agree with the proposed tolerance of +/- 20% for each nutrient content element. These \ntolerances align with what is allowed on the Nutrition Facts statement mandated by FDA.59 The \nranges specified in the proposed rule are an improvement over the tolerances set forth in TTB \nProcedure 2020-1, which sets an upper but not lower tolerance limit for calories, carbohydrates, \nand fat, stating that products may be “within a reasonable range below the labeled or advertised \namount” and a lower but not upper limit for protein.60 The +/- 20% tolerance ranges strike a \nbalance of being generous enough to allow for the option to use databases for standard products \nwhile still providing consumers information accurate enough to make informed choices about \ntheir health. The tolerance limits should not be increased as this would diminish their usefulness \nto consumers. \n \n     \n \n14 \n \n8) All products with 0.5% ABV or more should clearly list %ABV. \n \na. Beers Not Defined as “Malt Beverages"" and Non-Alcoholic (NA) Beers \n \nWe agree with TTB’s decision to mandate an alcohol content statement on the labels of beers not \ndefined as “malt beverages.” These products, which are under FDA labeling jurisdiction, are \nrequired to bear the “Nutrition Facts” panel, but consumers often miss out on vital alcohol \ncontent information because %ABV is not mandatory. This information is both important for \npublic health and, as explained in the rule, would facilitate revenue protection by making it clear \nthat the products are subject to tax.1 \n \nWe also agree with TTB’s decision to require an “Alcohol Facts” statement for non-alcoholic \nmalt beverages under TTB control, but to not require a specific statement of the percentage of \nalcohol by volume. An “Alcohol Facts” statement is needed to inform consumers of their calorie \nand nutritional content, but since “non-alcoholic” is clearly defined for malt beverages, these \nproducts can be exempt from the requirement to disclose %ABV and fluid ounces of pure \nethanol, as long as the proper terminology appears on-package. The phrase “contains less than \n0.5 percent (or .5%) alcohol by volume” is currently required to appear directly adjacent to the \nterm “non-alcoholic.”\n61 \nb. Wine \n \nWe agree with TTB’s proposal to require %ABV labeling on all wine. Percent ABV is currently \nonly required on wines with less than 7% ABV or greater than 14% ABV (wines of 7-14% ABV \ncan omit this information if labeled “table wine”),62 but wine should not be exempt from \nproviding accurate, specific mandatory statements of %ABV on label. Consumers can only make \ninformed decisions about how much to drink if they have access to information on alcohol \nstrength. \n \nLabeling with only a %ABV range would leave consumers with incomplete information about \nthe strength of wine. As mentioned above, this is basic information that consumers look for and \nmandating this information is robustly supported by consumers and important to their purchasing \ndecisions. A %ABV range is not specific enough to fully inform consumers as there is double the \namount of alcohol in a same-sized serving of a 14% ABV wine compared to a 7% ABV wine. \nWith only a %ABV range, consumers may accidentally consume more alcohol than intended, \nwhich increases the risk of alcohol-related injuries and death. \n \n9) Clear formatting requirements are needed to ensure consumers can consistently find \nnutrition and alcohol content information. \n \nTTB is soliciting feedback on format and display of the “Alcohol Facts” panel including requests \nfor comment on general formatting, linear display, and whether the option to provide “Alcohol \nFacts” solely via QR code should be allowed. \n \n \n1 Note: for beers not defined as “malt beverages” that are regulated by the FDA, TTB plans to use its authority \nunder the Internal Revenue Code to require “Alcohol Facts” information on these products    \n \n15 \n \na. General Formatting Recommendations \n \nThe proposed rule requires that the panel or linear display be offset within a box by use of \nhairlines with all black (or one color) type on a contrasting background in an easy-to-read type \nstyle that uses both upper- and lower-case letters. Minimum type size is 1 millimeter for smaller \ncontainers and 2 millimeters for larger containers. The terms “Alcohol Facts” and “Amount per \nserving” must appear in bold. \n \nOverall we agree with these requirements, and request additional requirements for a larger type \nsize for calories, minimum spacing and kerning, and a standardized font, all of which are \nrequired by FDA on the Nutrition Facts panel (see Figure 5 for example of FDA-regulated \nalcohol).\n63 However, linear formatting should only be allowed on very small containers. We also \nurge TTB to adopt greater specificity with regard to providing contrasting color, as this term is \nsubject to potentially wide interpretation, and suggest that the TTB use language adopted by \nFDA in regulations for Nutrition Facts, which require that the disclosure “shall be all black or \none color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical.”\n64 \nTTB should additionally specify, at minimum, that “contrasting background” does not include \ntwo different shades of the same color (as is popular on some beer cans currently and difficult to \nread) (see Figure 6). \n \nb. Display Orientation and Format \n \nThe proposed rule allows for horizontal or vertical “Alcohol Facts”. Requiring that this \ninformation appear in a horizontal format would increase the chances that consumers notice and \nutilize it, as a vertical format requires the consumer to take the additional step of turning the \nbottle sideways to access the information (see Figure 4). TTB should only allow vertical \npresentation of “Alcohol Facts” on smaller packages. A literature review prepared for Food \nStandards Australia New Zealand included “text to be printed horizontally rather than vertically” \nin a summary of factors that gain attention on food labels.65 \n \nTTB is soliciting feedback on whether consumers would have trouble locating an “Alcohol \nFacts” panel using a linear display. The current proposal allows for “Alcohol Facts” information \nto be displayed in either panel (as shown in Figure 5) or linear format (as shown in Figure 6), \nbut linear formatting should only be allowed on smaller containers.  \n \nThe panel format would make the “Alcohol Facts” information easier for consumers to locate \nand read compared to a linear display. TTB notes that they are providing this option to prevent \nbusinesses from having to purchase new equipment to add an additional label. A CSPI analysis \nof the labels of products from the top wine and beer brands (described above) found that, of \nwines and beers that contained serving information, only 5% used a block (also known as panel) \nformat whereas 95% used the continuous (also known as linear) format.\n14 This suggests a strong \nindustry preference for this format and a likelihood that this will continue to be used heavily. \nBecause the linear format is difficult for consumers to find and read, TTB should mandate panel \nformat on most packages to avoid this outcome.  \n    \n \n16 \n \nCurrently, FDA only allows the option for linear presentation of the mandatory Nutrition Facts \npanel for products in very small packages, which does not include standard-size products, as \nsuch packages are large enough to carry nutrition facts and ingredients.66 If linear display is \nallowed, it should be reserved as an option for containers below a certain size and required to \nappear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type to aid consumers in locating it.  \n \nFigure 5. FDA-regulated Angry Orchard Cider, 12-ounce bottle bearing Nutrition \nFacts panel using black type on white background \n  \nPhoto: Christina LiPuma/CSPI \n \nFigure 6. Blue Moon beer, 12-ounce bottle with linear, vertically formatted \nstatement of average analysis using light blue type on on dark blue background  \n  \nPhoto: Christina LiPuma/CSPI \n \n   \n \n17 \n \n \nc. Maximum Type Size for %ABV on Malt Beverage \n \nTTB should remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol \ncontent for wine and malt beverages that appear in an “Alcohol Facts” statement but specify \ninstead that the %ABV must be the same size as the other text in the “Alcohol Facts” statement \n(no larger, no smaller). For malt beverages, there is no need for TTB to remove the maximum \ntype size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label, as this \ninformation would be easy to find alongside other important per-serving information in the \n“Alcohol Facts” panel.  \n \nd. Electronic Display Should Not be Allowed \n \nWe support TTB’s proposed approach of requiring the alcohol content and nutrition information \nto be listed on the physical beverage container. There should not be an option to provide this \nsolely via QR code. Electronic disclosure places a barrier between consumers and this vital \nhealth and safety information.  \n \nConsumers prefer to receive this information directly on the product packaging. In the March \n2024 poll mentioned above, adults who drink alcohol were asked: “How would you prefer to \nlearn about the ingredients, alcohol content, allergens, calories, and nutritional content of an \nalcoholic beverage?” Respondents could select one of four response options: \n• Read this information on the label of the container \n• Scan a QR code on the label \n• Visit a website address provided on the label \n• I do not want to learn this information \n \nMore than three quarters (76%) of respondents said they would prefer to read information on the \nlabel of the container, while only 11% preferred to scan a QR code. The desire to see this \ninformation on-package was particularly strong among respondents living in suburban (79%) and \nrural communities (78%) compared to those living in urban communities (70%) and respondents \nover the age of 65 (83%) compared to younger respondents (71% of respondents ages 21-34) \n(Appendix A). \n \nBarriers created by QR code disclosures would disproportionately affect consumers who are \nolder or have lower incomes. Accessing a QR code requires a smartphone, which not all \nconsumers have, and Internet access coupled with good reception, which not all stores and \ndrinking venues provide. In 2024, 84% of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned \nsmartphones compared to 96% of adults with an annual household incomes over $100,000.\n67 \nThese data show similar sized gaps in smartphone ownership by age, with 79% of adults aged 65 \nand older owning smartphones compared to 91 to 98% of adults in younger age groups.  \n \nThose living in rural or tribal areas would also be disproportionately impacted by lack of access \nto information if provided via QR code. A recent Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) \nreport,\n68 which included data from 2022, shows a rural-urban gap for access to high-speed \nmobile internet (defined as 5G-New Radio (5G-NR) with upload/download speeds at least 35/3    \n \n18 \n \nmegabits per second (Mbps)) with 64% access in rural areas versus 98% in urban areas. People \nliving in tribal areas also face lower rates of access to reliable mobile internet (78%) compared to \nthose living in urban areas. Even rates of “fixed terrestrial services” (i.e., fixed broadband \nservices excluding fixed satellite service) deployments at all internet speeds differ for rural \nversus urban versus tribal areas, with especially large gaps in access to internet speeds of 100/20 \nMbps (which FCC uses as a benchmark to assess progress towards the goal of ensuring all \nAmericans have access to “advanced telecommunications capability.”) While 98% of Americans \nliving in urban areas have access to fixed terrestrial service speeds of 100/20 Mbps, only 72% of \nthose living in rural areas and 76% of those living in tribal areas have access to this internet \nservice speed. \n \nMoreover, loading information through a QR code takes time, further deterring use and \nprolonging purchasing decisions. A loading time of even a few seconds could prolong shopping \ntime if comparing many products, making it less likely the information will be utilized. \n \nAlcohol industry members will complain about the lack of label space and argue that it will cost \nextra to place this information on-package, but they are already providing a full nutrition facts \npanel on-package for all alcoholic beverages that fall under FDA’s jurisdiction (see Figure 5). \nAnd non-mandatory label information, such as marketing, could be presented via QR code if \nindustry members are concerned about label space. \n \n10) The compliance period should be shortened to 3.5 years and harmonized with the \nallergens labeling rule to minimize cost. \n \nThroughout the proposed rule, TTB is soliciting feedback on the cost that these changes might \nhave for industry. Producers will incur some costs when implementing updated labeling \nrequirements and may opt to pass these costs along to consumers. But alcohol manufacturers, \nincluding small producers, with products under FDA’s jurisdiction have been successfully \nproviding similar labels for years and remain economically viable. For example, most hard cider \nproducers must comply with FDA labeling rules, and local and regional hard cider sales \nincreased by 6% from 2022 to 2023,\n69 demonstrating that small alcoholic beverage businesses \ncan thrive while adhering to comprehensive labeling requirements. Additionally, some beverages \nare providing some of this information already on a voluntary basis. As mentioned above, an \nanalysis of labels from top wine and beer brands that 63% of beers chose to include the statement \nof average analysis—proof that this is feasible. \n \nIt is also worth noting that higher prices for alcoholic beverages, assuming that manufacturers \npass at least some of any added costs on to consumers, would not be a bad thing from a public \nhealth perspective. Policies that increase the price of alcohol decrease alcohol consumption.\n70 \nAlcohol prices and taxes are inversely associated with alcohol-related morbidity and mortality \nincluding violence, traffic crash fatalities, and drunk driving.71 An increase in the price of \nalcoholic beverages could help those who drink to better adhere to moderate drinking guidelines \nand lead to a reduction in alcohol-related morbidity and related costs.  \n \n     \n \n19 \n \nStill, it is understandable that TTB is conscious of the price of these changes and the costs of \nrelabeling are such that the impact upon price will be limited. Costs can be minimized by \nselecting a fair compliance deadline and coordinating the compliance deadline with the allergen \nlabeling rule. \n \na. Selecting a Fair Compliance Date \n \nThe proposed compliance period of 5 years is too long. According to FDA, food and beverage \nproducts tend to be voluntarily relabeled on a 2-5 year cycle, with most products undergoing \nvoluntary label changes at least every 2-3 years.\n72 Generally, the cost of label changes includes \nnew labeling equipment (if needed) and any costs associated with label redesign, printing, and \nadministrative costs. While extra staff time for mandatory label specific changes may add slight \ncost, when label changes for regulatory purposes coincide with changes the manufacturer would \nhave made to their label in any case, the analysis estimates that there is minimal additional cost \nfor the label design change to the manufacturer if no new labeling equipment is needed. \n \nTTB’s own economic estimates demonstrate that the extended 5-year cycle is unnecessary as it \nprovides little to no cost savings relative to a 3.5-year compliance period. The agency model \nassumes that for brand name products, 100% of changes would overlap with a regularly \nscheduled change within 2 years and that private labels, which make up a smaller share of the \nmarket, would be able to coordinate 100% of their changes by the 3.5-year mark. The model \nestimates that there are per-UPC cost reductions in extending the compliance period from 2 years \nto 3.5 years, but from 3.5 years onward the cost per UPC does not decrease further. Similarly, the \ntotal cost would not decrease further by extending the compliance period out past 3.5 years. \n \nAnother metric used in TTB’s analysis, the total cost using a 2% discount rate, similarly sees a \ndramatic decrease in the total cost when extending the deadline from 2 years to 3.5 years ($323.4 \nmillion at 2 years down to $259.5 million at 3 years and down to $204.3 million 3.5 years). \nHowever, the reduction in price is far smaller when extending from a 3.5- to a 5-year compliance \nperiod, which reduces the discounted total by only ~$3 million more (1.5%). Based on TTB’s \nown analysis, a 3.5-year compliance period would be more than fair and strike a balance between \nminimizing cost to industry and getting consumers access to important and long overdue \ninformation in a timely fashion. \n \nb. Coordinating Compliance Date Among Other TTB Rulings \n \nTo further minimize costs, we recommend that TTB align the compliance dates for the two \ncurrent proposed rules. We also urge TTB to release the third rule on ingredients labeling, which \nwas previously sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n73 This is a pre-rule and \nas such would likely take much longer than the other two rules to finalize. Because full \ncoordination of all three rules would likely lead to significant delay of the first two rules, we \nrecommend that compliance dates on only the first two rules be coordinated. \n \n     \n \n20 \n \n11) Conclusion \n \nIncreased transparency for alcohol labeling is desired by consumers and long overdue. We hope \nthat TTB will move swiftly to finalize this proposed rule with the adjustments described above \nso that consumers can have access to the nutrition and alcohol content information that they want \nand need to make informed decisions about their health. \n \nSincerely,  \n \nChristina LiPuma, MPH, RDN   \nPolicy Associate   \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest \nclipuma@cspinet.org  \n \nEva Greenthal, MS, MPH \nSenior Policy Scientist \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest \negreenthal@cspinet.org  \n \nSarah Sorscher, JD, MPH \nDirector, Regulatory Affairs \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest \nssorscher@cspinet.org \n \n     \n \n21 \n \nAppendix A.  \n \nTable 1.

We thank you in advance for your time and \nattention to these comments. \n \nAs you know, The Brewers Association is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association \nof brewers, for brewers and by brewers.  We have approximately 5,000 U.S. \nprofessional brewery members and over 1,200 supplier members from throughout \nthe beer supply chain.  Our mission is to promote and protect American \ncraft brewers and their beers. \n \nThe Brewers Association has long championed transparency in the labeling and \nadvertising of malt beverages (those subject to the Federal Alcohol Administration \nAct2 – FAA Act) and all beer.  We have called for mandatory alcohol content labeling \nand disclosure of major allergens3 for many years.  But America’s small and \nindependent brewers also face unprecedented headwinds today.  A crowded \nmarketplace, consumption declines, rising supply and labor costs, financially \nchallenged consumers, and other difficulties have seen the market for our \nmembers’ beer (and, indeed, all beer) contract and brewery closings outpace \nopenings last year for the first time in decades. \n \n \n1 90 Fed. Reg. 6651 (Jan. 17, 2025). \n2 27 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. \n3 The subject of TTB Notice 238, 90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (Jan. 17, 2025). 2 \n \nGiven these headwinds, we urge TTB to pay special attention to small businesses’ \nneeds in proceeding with any new labeling mandate.  TTB and its predecessor have \nconsidered mandatory nutrient and nutritional labeling regulations since the 1970s, \nbelying any argument that new regulations are urgently needed.  Moreover, while \nNotice 237 embraces some ideas – notably more generous tolerances and a five-\nyear phase-in period – that would mitigate a final rule’s impact on small business, \nsubstantial burdens remain.  Those burdens will fall with particular force on small \nbatch products of small producers, tilting the playing field even more in favor of \nlarge multinational brewers.  We urge TTB to consider carefully the impact of its \nactions on small American manufacturers as it moves forward. \n \n1. History Justiﬁes a Healthy Skepticism About this Rule \n \nAny keen observer of the federal regulation of labeling and marketing of malt \nbeverages, wine, and distilled spirits must surely get a sense of “déjà vu all over \nagain”4 when reviewing the nutritional disclosure mandates proposed in Notice 237.  \nIn addition, taking a broader societal look at the record of such nutritional \ndisclosure mandates, it is hard not to question their effectiveness in achieving their \nobjectives. \n \nTTB’s predecessor, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), first \nproposed nutrient labeling rules, in the form of mandatory ingredient labeling, in the \n1970s.  ATF proposed ingredient labeling and then withdrew the proposal in 1975, \nconcluding that the costs of the proposal outweighed any benefit to consumers.5  \nThe federal Food & Drug Administration (FDA) promptly stepped in, proposing \ningredient labeling for alcohol beverage labels imposed under its existing federal \nFood, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authority.6  A legal challenge to FDA’s action \nhelped persuade FDA to abandon that effort, deferring to ATF on products subject \nto the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FAA Act.7 \n \nWith FDA deferring to ATF, ATF itself commencing rulemaking to impose an \ningredient (nutrient) labeling regime of its own on FAA Act-regulated products, with \nregulations published in 1980.8  The incoming Administration of President Ronald \nReagan sought to withdraw these regulations, eventually succeeding after a series \nof court decisions to resolve a legal challenge to ATF’s decision to withdraw the \nrule.9  The saga, of course, was not over, and the next round of proposals, this time \nwith mandatory nutritional information in addition to nutrient/ingredient \ndisclosures, emerged in the early 2000s.  Notice 237 acknowledges and catalogues \nthose and subsequent nutritional labeling efforts by TTB.10 \n \n4 A phrase often attributed to baseball great Yogi Berra. \n5 See 40 Fed. Reg. 52613 (Nov. 11, 1975). \n6 See 41 Fed. Reg. 18538 (May 5, 1976). \n7 See Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. Mathews, 435 F . Supp. 5 (W.D. Ky. 1976). \n8 See 45 Fed. Reg. 40538 (June 13, 1980). \n9 See, e.g., 48 Fed. Reg. 10309 (March 11, 1983) (notice of withdrawal); Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest, v. Donald T. Regan, Secretary of the Treasury, 802 F .2d 518 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Center for \nScience in the Public. Int. v. Dept. of Treasury, 573 F . Supp. 1168 (D.D.C. 1983). \n10 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6656-6664. 3 \n \n \nWhile the ATF and TTB concluded, multiple times, to focus limited resources \nelsewhere in the past fifty years, other parts of the federal government pursued an \nagenda of mandatory nutritional labeling on multiple fronts.  Efforts to impose \nnutritional labeling on food kicked off in 1969 with the White House Conference on \nFood, Nutrition, and Health recommending FDA regulations.11  By 1973, that \nrecommendation had yielded final FDA regulations that were mandatory for foods \nmaking any nutrition claims or when nutrients were added to the food.  By the late \n1980s, a chorus of advocacy called for universal nutritional labeling on food, and \namidst multiple FDA proposals, Congress responded by passing the Nutrition \nLabeling and Education Act (NLEA).12  The NLEA gave FDA explicit authority to \nrequire nutritional labeling on most food packages and resulted in final FDA \nregulations that were published in 1993. \n \nFollowing the imposition of near-universal nutritional labeling for packaged foods, \nfood service at restaurants represented the next frontier.  The Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)13 required chain restaurants (those that are \npart of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and \noffering for sale substantially the same menu items) to disclose calorie and other \nnutrition information to consumers at the point of sale.  FDA regulations \nimplementing the ACA’s mandate went into effect in 2018,14 although multiple cities \nand states already had mandated calorie and nutritional disclosures for restaurants \nearlier. \n \nAll told, since 1970 the subject of nutrient and nutritional disclosures for foods has \ntaken up thousands of pages of the Federal Register, along with numerous rulings, \ninterpretive guidance documents, and official government websites.  The primary \npurpose of all these mandates has been to induce Americans to eat healthier, with \na particular emphasis on controlling excessive calorie intake.  One would think, \nthen, that fifty-plus years of federal government action would have produced a track \nrecord of success, with Americas eating healthier than ever before. \n \nOf course, history tells a very different story.  Obesity rates have soared, with each \nnew round of mandatory nutritional labeling having no discernable impact on the \ncrises. \n \n \n11 See NIH National Library of Medicine, History of Nutrition Labeling, available at \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209859/ (last visited August 7, 2025). \n12 See Public Law No. 101-535. \n13 See Public Law No. 111-148. \n14 See 79 Fed. Reg. 71156 (Dec. 1, 2014). 4 \n \n 15 \nIn sharp contrast, per-capita alcohol consumption has remained remarkably steady \nsince 1970, largely tracking demographic and economic patters.16  Indeed, in the \npast three years alcohol beverage consumption has fallen to historic lows.17  In \nshort, decades of real-world experience provide zero evidence that nutritional \nlabeling leads to healthier eating choices, nor that the absence of such labeling on \nalcohol beverages increases unhealthy consumption. \n \nFinally, we cannot help but note the irony that the current effort to impose \nnutritional labeling on alcohol arose from 2022’s Treasury Report on Competition.18  \nThe Treasury Report found that ‘‘[r]egulatory proposals that could serve public \nhealth and foster competition by providing information to consumers, such as \nmandatory allergen, nutrition, and ingredient labeling proposals, have not been \nimplemented” and urged the TTB to take action to revive rulemaking on nutrition \nlabelling, among several subjects.19  But even a casual review of Notice 237 would \nconclude that it is about consumer information and education, not competition.  \nIndeed, by mandating a uniform set of disclosures by nearly all alcohol beverage \nproducers, any final rule will have the effect (like all regulations) of removing an \n \n15 Ashley W.

A government mandate \nreplacing competition is the antithesis of fostering competition.  Moreover, as \nexplained further below, by imposing disproportionate burdens on small producers \nversus large, new nutritional disclosure mandates could further tilt the playing field \ntowards large market share companies and against market entrants and upstart \ncompetitors. \n \n2. A Final Rule will Burden Small Producers \n \nThe Brewers Association appreciates TTB’s efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nproposed nutritional mandate on small businesses.  While Notice 237’s broader \ntolerances for calculating alcohol content and nutritional measures and its five-\nyear implementation period certainly help, we wish to emphasize that a final rule \nwill impose substantial burdens on many small and independent brewers, as well \nas small wineries, distilleries, and cider makers. \n \nMore generous tolerances will often allow a brewer to promulgate compliant \nnutritional measures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) using typical values \ncharts, but only for “standard products”20 (e.g., a beer made from only malted \nbarley, hops, water, and yeast).  Similarly, the +/- 1% alcohol by volume (ABV) \ntolerance proposed in Notice 237 will allow brewers to calculate alcohol content \nwithout outside testing or sophisticated equipment.  But in today’s innovative \nbrewing industry, a great many products use other ingredients in brewing, such as \nexotic grains, fruits, nuts, herbs and spices, flavorings, and a myriad of other food \nproducts.  For example, this spring the Brewers Association solicited comments \nfrom its members on topics related to Notice 237, including whether they produce \nproducts made with non-standard ingredients.  Of the 83 respondents, 77 (over \n90%) indicated that they make some beers using special ingredients.  We believe \nthat the respondents provide a representative sample of today’s craft brewers. \n \nTTB’s Public COLAs Registry confirms that non-standard malt beverages make up a \nsubstantial part of today’s total malt beverage market.  A search of the Registry \nearlier this month21 identified a total of 29,752 malt beverage label approvals in the \npast year.  Of those, 9,159 were class/type 906, malt beverage specialties – flavored \nmalt beverages.  In other words, over thirty percent of new malt beverage labels \nlikely contain flavorings or other ingredients that could render the use of typical \nvalues tables non-compliant.  For such products in interstate commerce, expensive \ntesting – either by an outside lab or by purchasing new equipment – would be \nrequired to ensure compliance. \n \nIn addition, although many Brewers Association members change labels at least \nonce every five years, many do not.  The responses to the Brewers Association \nsurvey contain many too general to clearly denote whether product labels change \nmore- or less than every five years.  But roughly one-third of the respondents appear \n \n20 A point TTB appears to recognize.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. \n21 On August 7, 2025. 6 \n \nto change labels less often (some indicating they never update labels on existing \nproducts unless required to do so), and another one-third provided ambiguous \nanswers suggestive of long waits before label re-design.  While the five-year cycle \nlikely holds true for the large brewers and most other large suppliers, it does not \nappear to reflect the entirety or even a substantial majority of the craft beer market. \n \nNotice 237, as written, will particularly impact practices of craft brewers to vary \nrecipes of a particular brand.  This practice occurs most frequently in the case of \nseasonal products, with an annual release (for example, a holiday ale) delighting \nconsumers with variations in the recipe, keeping the brewery’s customers \ninterested in trying the beer year after year.  Brewers employing this practice will \nneed to either print new labels each year, something many do not do today, or stop \nvarying the recipe each year.  In short, Notice 237 could force many brewers to \nchoose between increased costs (to print new labels every year) or reduced \ninnovation (by keeping recipes consistent year-over-year). \n \nIn sum, while Notice 237 takes some steps to mitigate its impact on small \nproducers, it will still have a negative impact on our members, with the biggest \nburden falling on the smallest packaging brewers with the least ability to absorb \nadditional costs.  The result will be a combination of greater costs, reduced \ninnovation, and simple non-compliance. \n \n3. The Brewers Association Continues to Believe that DiƯerentiating \nBetween Large and Small Batch Products is Appropriate and Within TTB’s \nAuthority \n \nThere is no question that a nutrition labeling rule will impose burdens on small \nproducers and the viability of small-batch products.  Although the more realistic \ntolerances proposed in Notice 237 partially blunt these burdens, flavored and other \nspecialty malt beverages will continue to face a difficult choice under final rules if \nadopted as proposed:  (a) invest in expensive equipment to test such products; (b) \nsend such products to an outside laboratory at considerable expense; or (c) \ndiscontinue such products in interstate commerce to avoid the added expense.  In \nlight of this, the Brewers Association renews its call for TTB to adopt a different \nstandard for small producers or low-volume products – which would include most \nproducts from small producers – to mitigate a nutrition labeling rule’s impact on \nsmall businesses and on product innovation. \n \nTTB’s reasoning22 for rejecting differentiation between small-batch products and \nothers does not withstand closer scrutiny.  As a threshold observation, TTB’s \nregulations are full of differential treatment for brewers based on size.23  In its \nexplanation for rejecting this approach, TTB notes – but tellingly without claiming a \nlack of statutory authorization – that the statutory text of the FAA Act does not \nexplicitly authorize different treatment between large and small entities or between \nlarge and small batch size products.  But that text also does not reference \n \n22 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6687. \n23 See 27 C.F .R. §§ 25.91, 25.93, 25.164-25.165, & 25.297. 7 \n \nnutritional labeling and a host of other subjects now addressed in existing TTB \nregulations.  Notice 237 itself invokes the Agency’s “broad authority” to regulate \nalcohol.24  Notwithstanding the lack of an explicit statement in the statutory text, we \nbelieve it is well within the TTB’s discretion to create different rules based on \nproducer size, product volume, and batch size. \n \nNotice 237 additionally asserts that an exemption or differential treatment would \nundermine the “primary” purpose of the rule, which is providing more information \nto consumers.25  Before addressing the substance of this position, we note that this \nassertion undermines both the original impetus for initiating this rulemaking \n(premised on competition as announced in the Treasury Report on Competition), \nand TTB’s claimed basis for imposing alcohol content labeling on non-FAA Act \nproducts (premised on protection and collection of excise tax revenue).  \n \nThere is no reason a final rule cannot balance consumer information with the need \nto protect competition and the interests of small businesses.  We acknowledge, of \ncourse, that exempting or loosening standards for some small subset of the market \nwould marginally limit the information available to consumers.  But TTB and other \nfood labeling authorities already do this in a myriad of ways: \n \n\uf0b7 The nutritional labeling requirements (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and \nproteins) only apply to products moving in interstate commerce, thereby \nalready exempting many products that do not cross state lines.   \n \n\uf0b7 Several categories of alcohol beverages, notably including fermented hard \nseltzers, most hard ciders, and other low-alcohol wines, would not fall under \nNotice 237’s nutritional label rules.  While some of these (depending on \nproduction quantity and business size – see below) would fall under FDA’s \nnutritional labeling requirements, those requirements are diƯerent in \nmultiple respects from the requirements proposed in Notice 237. \n \n\uf0b7 The primary regulator imposing nutritional and other food label disclosures, \nthe FDA, exempts products produced in quantities under 100,000 units in a \nyear from its nutritional labeling requirements.26 \n \n\uf0b7 The FDA also exempts from those regulations retailers who have no more \nthan $500,000 in direct sales to consumers or no more than $50,000 in sales \nof food or dietary supplements to consumers.27 \n \n\uf0b7 The FDA’s requirement for menu labeling disclosures only applies to \nrestaurants and similar retail establishments that are a part of a chain with \n20 or more locations and doing business under the same name.28 \n \n24 See, e.g., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6654. \n25 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6687. \n26 See 21 C.F .R. §§ 101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(h)(2). \n27 See 21 C.F .R. §§ 101.9(j)(1) and 101.36(h)(1). \n28 See 21 C.F .R. § 101.11(a) (deﬁning “covered establishment”). 8 \n \n \nIn short, a sensible exemptions or adjustments for small batch products or small \nbusinesses would hardly be unprecedented and, in our view, would strike the \nappropriate balance between informing the consumer and promoting rigorous \ncompetition and consumer choice. \n \nA different requirement for small-batch products would be no harder to administer \nthan a host of other TTB rules that rely on industry member representations to make \ndeterminations during the Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) review process.  On \nissues as varied as class/type designation, alcohol content, interstate jurisdiction, \nand method of manufacture, TTB relies on the industry members providing it with \ntruthful information to review and approve COLAs.  TTB then polices the market to \nensure that the industry member did not, for example, fill a container labeled with \none TTB beverage type with liquid that constitutes another type.  TTB could easily \nadd a field to its COLA application form29 to identify whether or not a product \nqualifies for different treatment under a small-batch or small business threshold.  \nShould an industry member rely on such a COLA for products that have exceeded \nthe threshold, TTB would retain its considerable enforcement authority to police the \nmarket and punish non-compliance.  As a reminder to the industry member, TTB \ncan also “qualify” a label approval for a small-batch product, just as it does for \nCertificates of Exemption from Label Approval and in other appropriate \ncircumstances. \n \n4. If Regulations are Adopted, TTB Should Use the Term “Serving Facts” \ninstead of “Alcohol Facts”30 \n \nNotice 237 adopts the term “alcohol facts” as a shorthand for the specific \nnutritional and other disclosures it would mandate, and the term would accompany \nthe disclosures on actual labels.  The Brewers Association opposes this departure \nfrom TTB’s current term for voluntary nutritional labels, “serving facts,” and urges \nTTB to revert to that term should it move forward with Notice 237. \n \nFor over a decade consumers have seen the term “serving facts” on FAA Act-\nregulated alcohol beverages bearing voluntary nutritional information.31  \nConsumers, particularly those with an interest in such information, now recognize \nand understand the label and rely on it.  Moreover, we are not aware of any \nproblems or confusion arising from use of the term “serving facts.”  As such, the \nreasoning behind the proposed change is not readily apparent. \n \nThe term “alcohol facts” seems, at best, incongruous, and at worst, misdescriptive.  \nMost of the nutritional information proposed for disclosure in Notice 237 are, in \nfact, facts about various nutritional measures (not alcohol) per serving – in other \nwords, serving facts.  Surely consumers think of information on calories, \ncarbohydrates, fat, and protein as serving facts, regardless of whether that \n \n29 TTB F 5100.31. \n30 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.1., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6664-65. \n31 See TTB Ruling 2013–2 (May 28, 2013). 9 \n \ninformation relates to a product containing alcohol or not.  In contrast, the term \n“alcohol facts” implies facts about alcohol consumption, which the information \nproposed for disclosure in Notice 237 does not contain. \n \nThe Brewers Association disagrees with the suggestion, apparently made by certain \ncommenters and accepted by TTB, that “serving facts” would confuse consumers \nabout the alcoholic nature of products.  As noted above, the Brewers Association is \nnot aware of any problems with the voluntary use of “serving facts” under current \nTTB policy and rulings.  Moreover, there are many label indicia under existing \nregulations governing FAA Act-regulated products signaling that a product contains \nalcohol, including: \n \n\uf0b7 The mandatory government warning statement. \n \n\uf0b7 The class and/or type designation. \n \n\uf0b7 The alcohol content statement on most products, which Notice 237 would \nextend to all products, including all malt beverages and wines. \n \nMoreover, consumers respond to common-sense information such as the brand \nname of the product, as brand conveys important clues to consumers about the \nnature of the products they buy (i.e., consumers associate “Sierra Nevada” with \nmalt beverages and “Pepsi” with soft drinks).  The notion that a consumer will \nignore all such information and instead focus myopically on the words “serving \nfacts” to infer a product contains no alcohol makes no sense. \n \nFinally, Notice 237 ignores the reality that another subset of alcohol beverages \nalready use a different term than “alcohol facts” without any apparent problem.  \nProducts labeled under the primary labeling jurisdiction of the FDA must use the \nterm “nutrition facts.”32  Such products include fermented hard seltzers, most hard \nciders, and other low-alcohol wine products.  Yet to our knowledge, use of the \nwords “nutrition facts” has not misled consumers about the alcoholic nature of \nthese beverages. \n \nIf mandatory nutritional labeling rules are finalized, they should use the term \n“serving facts” and not “alcohol facts.” \n \n5. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports the \nDecision to Keep Disclosures Consistent with the Current Statement of \nAverage Analysis33 \n \nThe Brewers Association supports Notice 237’s approach to limit nutritional \ndisclosures to those familiar to consumers of light beer and other existing products \n– calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  These four measures have graced the \nlabels of many malt beverages since 1980, when TTB’s predecessor ATF first \n \n32 See 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. \n33 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.2., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6666-67. 10 \n \nmandated the use of a statement of average analysis on “light”/“lite” beer labels.34  \nWe see no reason to depart from that successful policy. \n \nThe Brewers Association does not support a rule that would mandate more \nextensive nutritional disclosures, like those mandated under the FD&C Act.35  \nShould TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the information required \nunder Notice 237’s proposed rule already will depart from FDA-mandated \ninformation due to the inclusion of alcohol content information.  Moreover, labels of \nFAA Act regulated products will depart from FDA-regulated products in multiple \nother ways, including the inclusion of the mandatory Government Warning \nStatement, a different standard of identity system, and the lack of ingredient \nlabeling information.  While FDA regulations and policy can provide useful guidance \nin appropriate circumstances, we do not believe that a lock-step adoption of FD&C \nAct nutritional information is appropriate. \n \nIn implementing nutritional labeling disclosures, the Brewers Association \nrecommends a common-sense refinement where multiple measures would round \nto zero.  In such cases, industry members should have the option of truncating the \ndisclosure of multiple measures as “0.”  This would amend currently proposed \nregulations, if finalized, to instead provide the option of stating “0 [the measures \nthat would display as zero].”  For example, many malt beverages contain zero fat \nand zero protein.  In such a case, the label could state “0 fat and protein.”  This \noption would provide flexibility and might save a little label space for other \npurposes. \n \nA question in Notice 237 about the nutritional disclosures specifically calls out \nwhether a final rule would have competitive effects.  As explained in Section 1 \nabove, the connection between mandatory nutritional disclosures and traditional \nnotions of competition are not clear and, indeed, replacing competition with a \nuniform government mandate is not typically viewed as a pro-competitive policy.  \nBut the differential burden that the regulations proposed in Notice 237 will place on \nlarge versus small businesses will further tilt the playing field towards big producers \nand high-volume brands.  The rule as proposed would apply equally to small-batch \nproducts and would require expensive testing (whether by an outside lab or in-\nhouse using costly equipment) for some, “non-standard,” products.  As such, there \ncan be no doubt that Notice 237 as written favors high-volume products that can \nspread the cost of compliance across larger revenues from a particular brand. \n \nAnother question asks whether a final rule would burden small producers.  As \nexplained in Sections 2 and 3 above, mandatory nutritional labeling rules will, even \nas promulgated with broad tolerances and a five-year implementation date, place a \nburden on small businesses.  We urge TTB to revisit the question of an exemption or \ndifferent rules for small-batch products or small businesses to alleviate this \nburden. \n \n \n34 See ATF Ruling 80-3. \n35 See generally 21 C.F .R. § 101.9. 11 \n \n \n \n \n6. If Regulations are Adopted, the Brewers Association Supports TTB’s \nObjective Standard Approach, but Burdens Remain36 \n \nThe Brewers Association has long advocated for objective and realistic labeling \ntolerances for small producers.  Subjective tolerances leave industry members \nguessing about their compliance obligations.  And tight tolerances inherently favor \nlarge producers, who can afford the machinery for tighter production runs and \npossess the equipment necessary to test and adjust batches (e.g., by adjusting \nwater addition, as is commonplace in high-gravity brewing) to meet labeled values.   \n \nFor the reasons above, the Brewers Association applauds the +/- 20% tolerance \nproposed in Notice 237 for calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  The tolerance \nis easily understood and does not leave brewers guessing about whether they are in \nor out of compliance.  And, as already noted, a 20% tolerance is broad enough to \nallow many (but not all) malt beverages to provide compliant label disclosures \nusing “typical value” charts that do not require sophisticated equipment or outside \ntesting.  \n \nThe Brewers Association also applauds the broader tolerance of +/- 1% ABV for \nlabeled alcohol content on malt beverage and beer labels.  For most malt beverage \nand beer products, a 1% ABV tolerance allows for compliant disclosures using \nsimple measurements, such as hydrometer measurements, and straightforward \ncalculations.  Departure from the existing 0.3% standard is overdue. \n \nWe wish to emphasize, however, that even the expanded and objective tolerances \nwill not allow reliable measures for the growing number of innovative brewery \nproducts made with unusual ingredients or employing unusual processes.  Adding \nfruit, fruit puree, or fruit juice to a malt beverage has become commonplace in the \npast decade and a half.  The addition of such materials, and many others (e.g., \nchocolate), make reliance on a “typical value” chart unreliable.  Indeed, as Notice \n237 itself notes, the proposed tolerances allow calculations or average value tables \nto work only for “standard products.”37  A great many malt beverages – roughly 30% \nbased on the last year of COLA approvals – cannot reliability use typical values or \nsimple calculations to comply with the nutritional disclosure requirements of \nNotice 237. \n \n7. The Brewers Association Supports Mandatory Alcohol Content Labeling \nfor Beer and Malt Beverages, Within a +/- 1% ABV Tolerance38 \n \nThe Brewers Association has long supported alcohol content labeling for malt \nbeverages, provided adequate tolerances are permitted.  Assuming a +/- 1% ABV \n \n36 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.3., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. \n37 See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667. \n38 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.4. & 5., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6669. 12 \n \ntolerance, as proposed by Notice 237, we accordingly support the proposed \nmandatory alcohol content labeling rule for malt beverages and non-FAA Act beer.39 \n \nAlcohol content information helps consumers understand the alcoholic strength of \na beverage so that they can better regulate their intake.  Alcohol content \ninformation is also well-understood by consumers, as it has been mandated on all \ndistilled spirits and most wines for nearly a century.  Thus, unlike untested \nproposals for “standard drink” and similar labeling, alcohol content is a concept \nthat consumers know and understand.  Helping consumer regulate their alcohol \nintake using information on alcohol-by-volume will require no education and faces \nno “learning curve.” \n \nAlthough we support mandatory alcohol content labeling, we also wish to underline \nthat adopting the rule will not be cost-free for small brewers for the reasons \nexplained in Sections 2 and 3 above. \n \nNotice 237 asks whether a +/- 1% ABV tolerance is potentially misleading \nconsumers.  We do not think so.  From a consumption standpoint, 1% ABV is simply \nnot enough alcohol to make a material difference in the intoxication of a person \nconsuming anything but absurd volumes of a malt beverage or beer.  For a beer \ndrinker to consume the equivalent in alcohol of one extra average-strength beer \n(5.0% ABV), that drinker would have to consume five beers, all containing more \nalcohol up to the maximum tolerance allowed, in a compressed amount of time.  \nSuch a consumer would already be intoxicated by any reasonable measure, \nregardless of the 1% ABV variance. \n \nIn addition, multiple policies of TTB already permit added small amounts of alcohol \nwithout a precise label disclosure, and those policies have not caused issues with \nthe public’s ability to control their consumption.  Malt beverages labeled “non-\nalcoholic” may contain almost .5% ABV.  And many non-alcohol products (e.g., soft \ndrinks) contain small amounts of alcohol, provided they remain under .5% ABV.  In \nboth examples, existing policy does not seek to disclose or regulate such de \nminimis amounts.  We see nothing misleading about a 1% ABV tolerance.  Sadly, it \nis not surprising that advocates for the largest multinational brewers seek a tighter \ntolerance, as a tight tolerance imposes costs on small brewers and accordingly \nprovides large companies with a competitive advantage. \n \nOn the subject of alcohol statements, the Brewers Association was disappointed \nthat Notice 237 does not contain any proposal to overhaul and modernize TTB’s \n \n39 In the case of beer products falling outside TTB’s FAA Act jurisdiction, we see a legitimate question \nas to TTB’s authority to mandate such disclosures, although we do not oppose them on policy \ngrounds.  Notice 237 asserts that mandatory alcohol content labeling for non-FAA Act beers (a \ncategory including most fermented hard seltzers) is warranted as a means to protect the revenue and \nenhance revenue collection.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 6667.  We think this reasoning strains credulity.  \nAfter all, and as already noted, alcohol beverage labels already contain numerous indicia that the \nproducts they identify are, in fact, alcoholic products subject to the federal excise tax.  Among other \nthings, the mandatory Government Warning Statement would tip oƯ any taxpayer or TTB auditor \nabout the presence of a taxable level of alcohol. 13 \n \noutdated regulations on the labeling and advertising of “non-alcoholic” and \n“alcohol free” beverages.40  As TTB knows, consumer interest non-alcoholic beer \nhas grown substantially in the past 7-8 years, and sales are increasing.  In January \n2020, the Brewers Association petitioned TTB to update its regulations governing \nsuch products, asking for common-sense changes in-line with the current market \nand consumers.  TTB’s failure to act on the petition for over five years cannot be \nexplained.  We renew our call to modernize the regulations on labeling and \nadvertising such products. \n \nNotice 237 inquires about where the alcohol content statement should appear.  In \nthe case of malt beverage regulated under the FAA Act, if TTB mandates broader \nnutritional label disclosures on labels, then placement of alcohol content within the \nstatement of other serving facts makes sense.  For added flexibility, however, we \nthink industry members should have the option of placing alcohol content \nelsewhere on the label, provided that the information meets the regulations’ \ngeneral requirements like those for prominence, minimum type size, and contrast.41 \n \n8. TTB Should not Mandate a Statement of Alcohol in Fluid Ounces42 \n \nThe concept of measures-of-alcohol-per-container labeling is unfamiliar to U.S. \nconsumers.  This puts such information in marked contrast to familiar concepts like \nnet contents and alcohol-by-volume measures.  The Brewers Association \naccordingly does not support a mandate for a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces \nand, if TTB proceeds with some of Notice 237’s disclosures, urges TTB to remove \nthe alcohol in ounces requirement from any final rules. \n \nConsumers interested in moderating their intake understand that total alcohol \nintake is a function of volume and alcohol content.  As TTB regulations have \nmandated net content information for many decades, and many FAA Act-regulated \nproducts (all distilled spirits, most wine, some beer) have had to display alcohol \ncontent for many years, this is a control method familiar to consumers.  We are not \naware of any significant confusion in using these measures. \n \nBut labeling with a statement of alcohol in fluid ounces can lead to significant \nconsumer confusion.  TTB’s labeling regulations, and those of its predecessors, \nhave always put a premium on telling consumers the nature of the beverage in the \ncontainer.43  Labeling that reduces all alcohol beverages to a single number will only \ntend to confuse consumers into viewing all alcohol beverages as the same.  This, of \ncourse, is not the case – each category (and indeed, class and type) of alcohol \nbeverage has its own unique properties.  One-size fits all obscures this reality in a \nmisleading manner. \n \n \n40 Currently at 27 C.F .R. § 7.65. \n41 See 27 C.F .R., Part 7, Subpart D. \n42 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.6., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6671. \n43 See, e.g., Statement of Joseph H. Choate, Jr., Hearings on HR. 8539 Before the Committee on Ways \nand Means, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935), at 10 (Act would provide the consumer with ""all the \nimportant factors which were of interest [to them] about what was in the bottle”). 14 \n \nOf course, we believe the proponents in favor of alcohol in fluid ounce labeling aim \nfor exactly the sort of confusion noted above.  The distilled spirits industry has long \nadvocated for equating all alcohol beverages under a variety of slogans:  “A drink is \na drink”; “equivalency”; etc.  Adopting this rhetoric will embrace a position in a \nlongstanding policy debate that Congress, to date, has not embraced.  TTB should \nnot make this leap. \n \nNotice 237 asks if its disclosures should reference the concept of a “standard \ndrink” or otherwise reference the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for \nAmericans.  The Brewers Association would see such references as a substantial \nerror.  As TTB knows, the Dietary Guidelines are updated every five years.  Indeed, as \nthese comments are written,44 substantial uncertainty surrounds what the next \niteration of the Dietary Guidelines (for 2025-2030) will have to say about alcohol.  \nTTB should not require a labeling rule subject to revision – requiring costly new \nlabels and other burdens on government resources and the industry – every five \nyears. \n \nThe proposed statement of alcohol in fluid ounces represents a significant and \nuntested departure from longstanding policies designed to help consumers of \nalcohol beverages moderate their consumption.  TTB should remove this feature \nfrom any final mandatory disclosure rule. \n \n9. If Regulations are Adopted, a Linear Display and Partial Disclosure via \nElectronic Means Both Present Sound Options for Minimizing Regulatory \nBurdens45 \n \nShould TTB proceed with a nutritional disclosure rule, the Brewers Association \nsupports the current proposal to permit industry members to display those in a \nlinear display.  We do not view a text box as a significant improvement in visibility, \nand such a requirement would require far more extensive re-designs of industry \nmember labels.  The Brewers Association also urges TTB to re-consider its decision \nnot to permit nutritional disclosures (calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein) by \nelectronic means, as such a system would reduce burdens on industry and \ngovernment, provide greater flexibility, and facilitate the export of U.S.-made \nproducts. \n \nA linear display gives producers more flexibility in designing their labels and avoids \nwhat would otherwise amount to a mandate for front-and-back labeling of \nproducts.  TTB’s experience is instructive – “light”/“lite” beer has been on the \nmarket for 45 years bearing the same nutritional information as proposed in Notice \n237.  Calories and carbohydrates constitute a central aspect of the inter-brand \ncompetition between such products.  Yet the statement of average analysis on a \nlight beer appears in a linear display without any evidence, to our knowledge, that \nsuch information does not reach consumers, many of whom choose light beer \nprecisely because of its reduced calories and/or carbohydrates.  We fail to see why \n \n44 In August 2025. \n45 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.7., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6672-73. 15 \n \na text box is needed when decades of experience demonstrates that a linear display \nis sufficient.  \n \nMoreover, the amount of space on a beer label is quite finite.  Adding a mandatory \ntext box will take up substantial room on the label and would force some producers \nto re-tool their labeling in order to accommodate the added space.  A brewer \npackaging in bottles, for example, might need to add back-labeling capabilities in \norder to accommodate an added text box.  Conversely, because the space on a \nbeer bottle or can is limited, it seems hard to believe that consumers will struggle \nlocating a linear display of nutritional information. \n \nNotice 237 asks whether TTB should abandon the maximum type size limitation on \nalcohol content statements for malt beverages.  We wholeheartedly agree with \nsuch a repeal.  As Notice 237 recognizes, alcohol content is important information \nto some consumers, helping them to regulate their alcohol intake.  The type size \nlimitation appears to be a vestige from before the Supreme Court’s Rubin v. Coors \ndecision,46 when the FAA Act prohibited alcohol content statements on malt \nbeverages.  It is well-past the time to do away with the remnants of this paternalistic \napproach to malt beverage consumers. \n \nWe also renew our call for TTB to provide for the electronic disclosure of nutritional \ninformation as an option for the industry.  An electronic disclosure option would \nstrike the right balance between consumer transparency and avoiding undue \nburdens on businesses, especially small businesses.  TTB’s own figures show that \neven among groups with comparatively “low” access to smart phones, that access \nalready reaches over three-quarters of the population.  According to the Pew \nResearch Center, as of last year 91 percent of all American adults have smart \nphones, and 98 percent have a cell phone of some kind.47  Those numbers will only \ngrow in the future.  Notably, the Pew Research data shows that smartphone \npenetration is lowest (at a still substantial 79%) among persons over 65 years of \nage, who tend to own non-“smart” cellphones in greater numbers.48  Today’s 65+ \ncohort, with their relative resistance to smartphone technology, will shrink over \ntime.  Indeed, as the nutritional disclosures mandated by Notice 237 will not likely \nbecome mandatory until six or seven years after the close of the current comment \nperiod, smartphone ownership will likely be near-universal by the time any \nregulations become effective. \n \nAn electronic solution disclosing nutritional information via QR code would ease the \nburden of Notice 237 on small businesses.  A QR code can accommodate \nvariations of a recipe, whether inadvertent or deliberate, without the need to design \nand order new labels.  The brewer would simply update information linked to the QR \ncode, saving substantial resources.  A QR code disclosure option also would permit \nbrewers to provide this information in different formats (e.g., in European \n \n46 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995). \n47 See Pew Research Center, Mobile phone ownership over time, available at \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/ (last visited August 10, 2025). \n48 See id. 16 \n \nmeasures) for different markets without the need to redesign labels.  This would \nhelp boost the competitiveness of American-brewed beer in foreign markets. \n \n10. If Regulations are Adopted, Reference Amounts Should be Adjusted to \nReﬂect Typical Serving Sizes of Beer49 \n \nThe Brewers Association believes Notice 237 needs to adjust its proposed \nreference sizes for malt beverages, specifically the five-ounce reference size for \nproducts between 7% and 16% ABV.  Reviewing the proposed reference sizes, \nNotice 237 appears to embrace sizes more appropriate for wine products in this \nalcohol content range. \n \nThe Brewers Association agrees that a 12-ounce reference size is appropriate for \nbeer containing not more than 7% ABV.  But the standard twelve-ounce beer serving \npersists for stronger products than 7% ABV.  Most craft brewers have a retail \ncomponent to their business, selling beer directly to the public.  Visiting almost any \ncraft brewery will confirm that they do provide smaller pours for products \nsomewhat above 7% ABV.  The dividing line, however, generally is set around 8% \nABV.  We accordingly urge TTB to apply the 12-ounce reference amount to products \ncontaining not more than 8% ABV instead of 7% ABV. \n \nIn addition, in observing the service of beer at craft breweries across the country, \nproducts in the 8% ABV to 16% ABV range are often served in different sizes, \ngenerally consistent with strength.  For products 8-12%, we believe an eight-ounce \nreference amount more accurately reflects the most typical pour size.  Then, for \nproducts containing more than 12% ABV but not more than 16% ABV, the five-\nounce reference amount proposed by Notice 237 appears appropriate.  For the \nstrongest products, the Brewers Association agrees with Notice 237’s proposal of a \ntwo-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products in the above 16% to 24% ABV \nrange, and a one-and-a-half-ounce reference amount for products above 24% ABV. \n \nThe Brewers Association does not see any merit in tying recommended serving sizes \nto any concept like a “standard drink.”  As explained in Section 8, above, \nconcerning fluid ounces per drink, this concept is unknown to the American \nconsumer.  Moreover, what constitutes a “standard drink” may be influenced by the \nDietary Guidelines.  As such, the label rule might require revaluation every five years \nas the Dietary Guidelines evolve.  Industry needs more certainty than that. \n \n11. If Regulations are Adopted, we do Not See the Need to Further \nComplicate the Regulations with Speciﬁc Dual-Column Rules50 \n \nThe Brewers Association would not oppose the voluntary use of dual-column \nlabeling by an industry member, provided that the information it displays is truthful \nand not misleading.  But we do not see a reason to further complicated the \nregulations with specific instructions governing what is simply the presentation of \n \n49 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.9., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. \n50 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.10., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6673. 17 \n \ntruthful, accurate, and specific “other information” on a label – something the \nexisting malt beverage regulations already authorize.51 \n \nNotice 237 asks whether a voluntary “dual column” rule should be allowed on \ncontainers containing 200-500% of the referenced amount or on containers \ncontaining 200-300% of the referenced amount (the FDA rule).  We believe such \ncomplexity is unnecessary, and producers should be able to choose either, so long \nas the information provided is truthful, accurate and specific.  Greater complexity \nwith a rule governing a voluntary labeling decision will only serve as a “trap of the \nunwary.” \n \n12. If Regulations are Adopted, a Five-Year Implementation Period Will Help \nMitigate its Impact on Small Businesses52 \n \nShould TTB finalize a nutritional labeling rule, the Brewers Association supports a \nfive-year compliance date.  Many small brewers update their labels at least once \nevery five years, reducing the added cost burden of a final rule.  Nevertheless, some \nsmall and independent brewers will need to redesign labels outside their usual \nprocess.  In our survey of members, roughly one-third indicated that at least some \nof their labels do not change within a five-year cycle.  Another roughly one-third \nsuggested that label redesigns are rare or infrequent but with less clarity on number \nof years, suggesting a longer time cycle for at least some of their labels. \n \nThe Brewers Association also supports Notice 237’s proposal to allow the addition \nof nutritional information without the need for a new COLA.  Submitting and \nreceiving label approval for a new COLA takes time and effort, and most small \nbusinesses do not have dedicated staff for such tasks.  Eliminating the need for this \nregulatory step would save both government and industry resources. \n \nFinally, today small and independent brewers, along with most of the alcohol \nbeverage industry, face the prospect of three new federal labeling mandates: \n \n\uf0b7 The nutritional, alcohol content, and possibly other disclosures \ncontemplated by Notice 237;  \n \n\uf0b7 The mandatory allergen disclosures contemplated by TTB Notice 238;53 and \n \n\uf0b7 For alcohol beverages falling under FDA’s primary labeling jurisdiction, a \nfront-of-label packaging mandate contemplated by FDA Docket No. FDA–\n2024–N–2910.54 \n \nThe prospect of implementing different labeling changes at different times is \ndaunting to any industry member, but particularly to small producers.  The Brewers \n \n51 See 27 C.F .R. § 7.56. \n52 Responsive to questions posed in Section VII.B.11., 90 Fed. Reg. at 6674. \n53 90 Fed. Reg. 5763 (Jan. 17, 2025). \n54 90 Fed. Reg. 5426 (Jan. 16, 2025). 18 \n \nAssociation accordingly urges TTB to coordinate any implementation date for \nNotice 237 with the mandatory effective date of any final allergen regulations \nflowing from TTB Notice 238 and any FDA front-of-package mandate applicable to \nalcohol beverages. \n \n*     *     * \n \nWe thank you for your careful consideration of these comments and look forward to \nworking with TTB on these important topics. \n \nSincerely, \n Marc E.

This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more \nthan $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is \ncommitted today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal \nresponsibility.\nBrewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency\nThe beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, \nconsumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to \ntransparency through the Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading \nbrewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to \nconsume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling \n2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content \nand ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program \nhas been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest \nbrewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an \nunparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers \nmake responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences \nbetween distinct types of alcohol beverages.\nAs a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB \nRuling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If \nTTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and \nalready well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could \ncleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance \ncosts would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already \ncomplies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.\nWhat follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.\n1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to \nconsumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the \nproposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?2\nB I  R e s p o n s e :  “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term \n“Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving \nFacts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, \ncalories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts \ndescriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance \ncosts by altering a widely used disclosure.\n2. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens \nby requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” \nstatement?  \nBI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly \nfor many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling \n2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.\n3. Are consumers  accustomed  to ﬁnding  nutrient  content  information  in a Serving  Facts \nstatement?  \nBI Response: For over a decade,  many brewers  have voluntarily  included  the Serving  Facts \nstatement  on their labels.\n4. Would  changing  the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause  confusion?  \nBI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  \nreflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol content expressed as \nalcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure  placement  should  also be flexible  – either  as part \nof a Servings  Facts disclosure  or elsewhere  on the label, and the widely  understood  \nabbreviation  “ABV” should  be permissible.\n5. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish  \nalcohol  beverages  from  other  food  items?  \nBI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar  term for consumers  that does not actually  \nreflect  the information  disclosed:  calories,  carbs,  protein,  fat, and alcohol  content.  It is \nunnecessary  to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish  alcohol  beverages  from other food \nitems,  as there are other sufficient  indicators  that the product  contains  alcohol  on the label. \n6. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement \nshould be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to 3\nthe statement on a mandatory or optional basis. \nBI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ \npledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. \nFor the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding \nnutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary \npackaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard \nfor disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and \nappropriate descriptor for these disclosures. \n7. TTB  speciﬁcally  seeks  comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling \nrequirements with regulations  issued  by FDA,  as updated  in 2016.  \nBI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for \nnutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage \nproducts (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics \nof alcohol beverages.\n8. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any \nmicronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that \ntheir disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB \nshould require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients  on alcohol  beverage  labels.  \nBI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom \npresent in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be \noptional. \n9. TTB also seeks comments  on whether  certain  nutrients  should  be listed only if present  at \nspeciﬁc  levels.  TTB is proposing  to require  the listing  of calories,  carbohydrate,  fat, and protein  \ncontent  on alcohol  beverages,  even if the product  does not contain,  or contains  only a de \nminimis  amount  of, these components.  However,  TTB speciﬁcally  seeks comments  on whether  \nfat and protein,  which  are not typically  found  in certain  alcohol  beverages,  should  be listed only \nif present  at speciﬁc  levels.  If so, what levels  should  trigger  these requirements?  TTB also seek \ncomments  on whether  any other nutrients,  such as sodium,  caffeine,  or sugar,  should  be \nrequired  to be listed if present  at a speciﬁc  level, even if they do not otherwise have to be \ndisclosed. \nBI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, \nand there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry 4\nand understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or \nsugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.\n10. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with \nthe Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?  \nBI Response : No.  FDA  labeling  requirements  address  wider  public  policy  goals  for  the  \nbroader  food  category.  Requiring  a Nutrition  Facts  Label  on alcohol  beverage  products  \nwould  be overwhelming  relative  to the  limited  scope  of nutrient s in alcohol  beverages.  \n11. Do the differences  between  alcohol  beverages  and other foods  make it \nunnecessary,  or even misleading,  to adopt  the type of nutrient  labeling  required  on food labels  \nthat are under  FDA’s labeling  jurisdiction?  \nBI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol \nbeverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also \nthe answer to Items #12 and 13 below.\n12. Would  information  on the percentage  of the daily value of the listed nutrients  \nprovided  by alcohol  beverages  be useful  information  for consumers?  \nBI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of \nlisted nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically \nconsume alcohol beverages for nutrient value. \n13. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead \nconsumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their \ndaily nutrient requirements? \nBI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do \nnot consume  them for nutritive  value.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  restrict  or prohibit  health  \nclaims  concerning  alcohol  beverages .\n14. For  greater  consistency  with  the  FDA  Nutrition  Facts  Label,  should  Alcohol  Facts  \nstatements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) \nor a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \nBI Response : Statements  of Average  Analysis  and  Serving  Facts  labels  allowed  by TTB  \nRuling  2013-2 , and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have  long  been  in use,  are  5\nfamiliar  to consumers,  and  provide  consumers  with  the  information  they  need  about  \nalcohol  beverages.  Any  additional  information  should  be voluntary.\n15. Would  the inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  to be found  in alcohol  \nbeverages  (such as trans-fat  and dietary  ﬁber) be useful  or potentially  misleading?  \nBI Response : The inclusion  of elements  not ordinarily  expected  in alcohol  beverages  is of \nno utility  and could  be confusing  to consumers.  \n16. Should  TTB allow numerical  statements  of the vitamin  and mineral  content  of \nalcohol  beverages,  assuming  the product  contains  vitamins  or minerals,  or could  such a \nstatement  create  an erroneous  impression  that consumption  of the alcohol  beverage  has \nnutritional  value or other health-related  beneﬁts?  \nBI Response : While  context  matters,  consumers  who choose  to drink alcohol  beverages  do \nnot consume  them for their vitamin  or mineral  content.  Moreover,  existing  regulations  prohibit  \nhealth  claims  for alcohol  beverage  products .\n17. How many industry  members  already  provide  nutrient  content  information  on \nlabels,  in advertisements  (such as websites),  or upon request  (for example,  to consumers  or \nrestaurants)? \nBI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest \nbrewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with \ntwelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and \nnutrient content information on request.\n18. Do  consumers  want  to see  Alcohol  Facts  labeling  on alcohol  beverage  products?  \nHow  might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information \nabout the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include  \nAlcohol  Facts  labeling?  How  do those  beneﬁts  compare  to the  costs  and  regulatory  burdens  \nassociated  with  such  revisions?  \nBI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling \n80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other \nalcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer \nand VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became \nmandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently \naccomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, \ncompliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the 6\nmarketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.\n19. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the \nalcohol  beverage  market?  \nBI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI \nbelieves enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market. \n20. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, \nin particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace? \nBI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already \nincludes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s \nproposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering \nthe alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended \ntime basis, should help with planning and execution.\n21. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect  \ninternational  trade  of alcohol  beverages?  \nBI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to \nalter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year \nimplementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, \nnutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these \nlabeling requirements. \n22. TTB is proposing  to modify  the tolerances  set out in the 2020 guidance  by \neliminating  references  to ""reasonable  ranges""  based  on ""good  manufacturing  practice  \nlimitations.""  Instead,  TTB is proposing  an objective  standard,  which  allows  a tolerance  of 20 \npercent  either  above  or below  the labeled  amount  for calories,  carbohydrates,  protein,  and \nfat….  TTB seeks comments  on whether  the proposed  tolerances  are broad  enough  to facilitate  \nreliance  on databases  for standard  products,  among  other methods  for calculating  calorie  and \nnutrient  content,  but still speciﬁc  enough  to provide  accurate  information  to consumers.  \nSpeciﬁcally,  TTB seeks comments  on whether  it should  instead  propose  the same tolerances  set \nforth in TTB Procedure  2020-1  or whether  another  approach  should  be considered.  \nBI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several \nyears. Its continued application is appropriate. 7\n23. For beers that are not deﬁned  as “malt beverages”  under  the FAA Act, TTB is proposing  \nto mandate  an alcohol  content  statement  on the label of the products  under  TTB’s IRC authority.  \nHowever,  these beers would  not be subject  to the proposed  Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements,  \nincluding  the requirement  for a statement  of the number  of ﬂuid ounces  of pure ethyl alcohol  per \nserving,  because  the Alcohol  Facts labeling  requirements  are being proposed  under  TTB’s FAA Act \nauthority,  which  does not apply to these products.  Instead,  these products  are subject  to FDA labeling  \nrequirements.  TTB believes  that requiring  an alcohol  content  statement  on these products  would  \nfacilitate  revenue.  The Beer Institute  and the Brewers  Association  made  substantially  similar  comments  \nin response  to Notice  No. 232. protection  by, among  other things,  making  it readily  apparent  that the \nproducts  are subject  to tax under  the IRC. TTB seeks comments  on this issue.  TTB also seeks comment  \non the proposal  to increase  the labeling  tolerance  to one percentage  point above  or below  the stated  \namount  for all malt beverages  and beers.  TTB seeks comment  on whether  increasing  the tolerance  for \nalcohol  content  to one percent  would  lower  the cost of compliance  for a mandatory  alcohol  content  \ndisclosure  and thereby  promote  competition  in the marketplace  if such disclosure  is required.  TTB also \nseeks comment  on whether  consumers  would  receive  adequate  information  about  the alcohol  content  \nof malt beverages  if the tolerance  were increased.  \nBI Response : Applying  a basic alcohol  disclosure  standard  – like the mandatory  and \nvoluntary  standards  already  in place and adding  alcohol  by volume  to all “IRC Alcohol  \nbeverages”  is appropriate  and consistent  with the goals of consumer-centric  disclosures.  \nFlexibility  in the location  of disclosure  is essential.  Furthermore,  alcohol  by volume  is the form \nof alcohol  content  disclosure  that consumers  recognize  and understand  across  all types of \nalcohol.  Adding  fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if \nmandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.\nAs for increasing  the labeling  tolerance  for malt beverages  from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues  \nto caution  against  this change,  as there is substantial  risk of misinforming  consumers  about  the \nalcohol  content  of malt beverages.  If TTB believes  an increase  in tolerance  is appropriate  for \nmalt beverages,  BI suggests  increasing  the tolerance  from .3% to .5%, providing  greater  \nflexibility  to brewers  while still providing  accurate  information  about  the alcohol  content  they \nare consuming.  \n  \n24. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether \nan Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages. \nBI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-\nalcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement\'s \nlocation.8\n25. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a \nrequirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, \non the labels of all alcohol beverage products? \nBI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is \nvaluable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. \nAlcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional \nstatements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither \nstraightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional \nstatements of alcohol content on labels. \n26. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt \nbeverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small  \nbusinesses?  \nBI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to \ncomply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly \nhigh or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (e.g., 5 years). A \n“fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater \nburden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.\n27. Will the proposed  increase  in alcohol  content  tolerances  for malt beverages  \nmislead  consumers?  \nBI Response : An increase  in alcohol  content  tolerance  from .3% to 1.0% is too much  and \nwill misinform  consumers  when  a producer  uses the full tolerance.  If TTB believes  it must \nprovide  additional  flexibility,  BI recommends  only a minor  increase  in the tolerance  level, such \nas from .3% to .5%.\n28. Do the proposed  labeling  requirements  for non-alcoholic  malt beverages  \nadequately  advise  the consumer  that the products  contain  less than 0.5 percent  alcohol  by \nvolume?  \nBI Response : Yes.\n29. Should  non-alcoholic  malt beverages  be exempted  from calorie  and nutrient  \nlabeling  requirements?  \nBI Response : No.9\n30. Would  an alternative  that allowed  table wines  to indicate  alcohol  content  as a \nrange  (e.g., 7–14 percent  alcohol  by volume)  place less of a burden  on small wineries  and \nimporters?  Would  this approach  provide  sufficient  information  to consumers?  \nBI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any \nalcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.\n31. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label \nif it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why?\nBI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts \ndisclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize \nadditional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.\n32. Alternatively,  should  TTB allow alcohol  content  labeling  as an optional  element  of \nthe Alcohol  Facts statement?\nBI Response : TTB should  require  disclosure  of alcohol  content,  expressed  as alcohol  by \nvolume,  on labels,  with the flexibility  of placing  it as part of a Serving  Facts disclosure  or \nelsewhere  on the label.\n33. Does the placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  compliance  costs and \nregulatory  burdens?  If so, how?\nBI Response : Disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  with flexibility  in placement  should  not \nmaterially  increase  compliance  costs or regulatory burdens.\n34. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol \nFacts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or \ninternational  standards?  \nBI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  \naffecting  competition . However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include \nalcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format. \n35. Would  it be easier  for consumers  to locate  alcohol  content  information  on a label \nif it is required  to be included  in the Alcohol  Facts statement  and if so, why? \nBI Response : Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts \ndisclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.10\n36. Should  TTB allow the use of alcohol  per serving  as an optional  element  of the \nAlcohol  Facts statement?\nBI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules \nwith the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition \ndisclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and \ndistilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that \nmatches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” \nmeasurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” \nis merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the \nreality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a \ndevice used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of \ncommunicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.\n37. Does  the  placement  of alcohol  content  information  affect  costs  of compliance  \nand  regulatory  burdens?  \nBI Response : Yes,  if the  placement  or form  of alcohol  content  information  changes.  The  \nindustry  is well-positioned  to continue  reflecting  Serving  Facts  information  on primary  and  \nsecondary  packaging  or near  the  net  contents  information  on both  primary  and  secondary  \npackaging  display  panels.  However,  compliance  costs  and  regulatory  burden  will  increase  if \nthe  requirements  change.\n38. Does the proposal  to require  alcohol  content  information  as part of the Alcohol  \nFacts statement  affect  competition  or issues  addressed  by international  trade agreements  or \ninternational  standards?  \nBI Response : We  do not  see  the  disclosures  allowed  by TTB  Ruling  2013-2  as adversely  \naffecting  competition .\n39. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving \nin the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the \nconsumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so \nchoose?\nBI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not \nprovide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only \nserve to confuse consumers. Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  \nfor a single  serving.  This reference  amount  for beer and a disclosure  of alcohol  by volume  \nprovide  the information  consumers  need to follow  consumption  and moderation  advice.  11\n40. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving \nin the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage \nmanufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?\nBI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid \nounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the \nmajority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements \nexpressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse \nconsumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; \ntherefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection. \n41. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? \nSpecifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid \nounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?\nBI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the \nsimplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they \npurchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers \nalready understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, \nexpress alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of \nproviding non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard \ndrinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between \nmalt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for \nall these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard \ndrink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.\n42. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms \n“drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms \nshould be used or defined for use on labels. \nBI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage \nlabels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a \n12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to \nmoderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer. \n43. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that \ninformation  is presented  in a linear  display?  \nBI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average \nanalysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since \nalcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels. 12\n44. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol \nFacts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information? \nBI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern \nto the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the \nterm “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, \nwe would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.\n45. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear \ndisplay that is not surrounded by a box? \nBI Response: Yes. \n46. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the \ntype size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels? \nBI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.\n47. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, \naffect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting \nrequirements?\nBI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other \nregulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been \nfollowing TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs \nby changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures. \n48. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of \nalcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement? \nBI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current \nminimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.\n49. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol \ncontent statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well? \nBI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum \nand maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.\n50. What alternatives  exist to convey  Alcohol  Facts information  to consumers?  13\nBI Response : TTB might  consider  allowing  QR codes  for voluntary disclosures only. \n51. How, if it all, would  the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as \ncompared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label? \nBI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the \nmarketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the \nproducts they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market \nmay be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for \nmandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information \nonly.\n52. What are the costs and beneﬁts  of aligning  Alcohol  Facts information  to \nrequirements  of other countries?  \nBI Response : BI sees no benefits  to aligning  nutrition  and alcohol  content  disclosures  in the \nUnited  States  with requirements  from other countries  with different  laws and regulatory  \nstructures.  The costs of compliance  and regulatory  burden  would  increase,  and consumers  in \nthe U.S. may be more confused  than informed  by labeling  requirements  imported  from other \nmarkets.  \n53. If TTB adopts  mandatory  Alcohol  Facts labeling  for alcohol  beverages,  should  it \ninclude  the option  of satisfying  the requirement  by making  the information  available  \nelectronically,  for example  by including  a QR code or website  address  on the label to allow \nconsumers  to view mandatory  Alcohol  Facts statements  on their mobile  devices  instead  of on \nthe product  label?  \nBI Response : Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.\n54. Would  this option  provide  consumers  with sufficient  access  to Alcohol  Facts \ninformation  at the retail store so that they can make informed  decisions,  given issues  such as \nthe need to use a smartphone,  potential  issues  regarding  the adequacy  of cellular  or Wi-Fi \ncoverage  at some retail stores,  and other potential  technological  challenges?  Would  the \nprovision  of mandatory  information  disclosures  via electronic  means  create  disproportional  \nbarriers  to access  for particular  communities?  \nBI Response : Mandatory  disclosures  should  be on the label. TTB should  limit the use of \nelectronic  disclosures  to voluntary  information  disclosures  only. 14\n55. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via \nelectronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? \nBI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means \nwould decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information \nshould be on the label.\n56. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB \nallow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should \nsome of the information be required to appear on the physical label? \nBI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, \nhowever, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means. \n57. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, \ncould the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion? \nBI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and \nalcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this \ninformation about all alcohol products.\n58. Are the proposed  reference  amounts  a reasonably  accurate  representation  of the \namount  of the product  customarily  consumed  as a single  serving?  \nBI Response : Consumers  typically  purchase  beer in a 12-oz container  intended  as a single  \nserving.  \n59. What data or other information  should  TTB consider  that would  give a better  \nestimate  of the amount  customarily  consumed  for a speciﬁc  product  category?\nBI Response : Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single \nserving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer. \n60. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth \nin TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages,  \nregardless  of the  alcohol  content)?  Why  or why  not?  \nBI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single \nserving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, \na cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \nand Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for 15\naccurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry \nsectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do \nnot understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure \nbeneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.\n61. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes? \nBI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB \nRuling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.\n62. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink \nequivalent  of 0.6  ﬂuid  ounces  of alcohol,  or would  this  mislead  consumers  by not  recognizing \nhow alcohol beverages are typically consumed? \nBI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is \nmisleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour \nor drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that \nis more useful than the existing approach.\n63. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings \nof an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?\nBI Response: No.\n64. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, \nconsistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way \nin which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled? \nBI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling \n2013-2, except to make them mandatory. \n65. Should  dual-column  displays  be allowed  on any container,  regardless  of the number  \nof servings  in that container,  consistent  with TTB Ruling  2013–2? The proposed  rule would  \nrequire  containers  with a net content  of more than 100 percent  but less than 200 percent  of a \nsingle  serving  size reference  amount  to be labeled  as containing  a single  serving.  TTB solicits  \ncomments  on whether  this is the best way to convey  the alcohol  and nutrient  content  of these \nproducts  to consumers.  \nBI Response: There  is no good reason  to change  the current  voluntary  standards  of TTB \nRuling  2013-2,  except  to make them mandatory.  16\n66. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change \nlabels? \nBI Response : It depends  on the  products.  There  are  products  in the  marketplace  with  \nlabels  that  have  remained  unchanged  for  several  years.  Some  of those  products  already  \ncomply  with  TTB  Ruling  2013-2,  while  other  labels  will  not  change  unless  the  requirements  \nchange.\n67. How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed \nrule?\n \nBI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our \nexperience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.\n68. Will 5 years provide  enough  time for small businesses  to coordinate  labeling  \nchanges  required  by regulatory  changes  with labeling  changes  that are planned  in the ordinary  \ncourse  of business?  \nBI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years \nis sufficient time to expect compliance.\n69. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be \n2 years,  3 years,  or another  length  of time?  \nBI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years \nis sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate. \n70. If a ﬁnal rule is issued,  will industry  members  begin implementation  of the labeling  \nchanges  in advance  of the compliance  date?  \nBI Response : Industry  members  are likely to begin complying  on a rolling  basis,  changing  \nlabels  in the normal  course  of business.  If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most \nof the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient \ntime to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.\nConclusion\nAs noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly \nencourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as 17\noutlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling \n2013-2 and BI’s comments above.\nIf there are issues for which the TTB sought comment in NPRM 237 that BI does not explicitly address \nin this response, please consider BI’s introductory comment as the response to such inquiries. \nAdditionally, BI reserves the right to amend these responses or to comment further as appropriate.'}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0196/attachment_1.docx', 'text': 'Comments of the Beer Institute Regarding NPRM 237\n\nThis submission represents comments of the Beer Institute (BI) regarding NPRM 237, by which the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an “Alcohol Facts” statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB\'s regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act).\n\nBI\xa0is a national trade association for the American brewing industry, representing brewers, beer importers, and industry suppliers. This industry supports more than 2.4 million jobs and provides more than $471 billion to the American economy. First founded in 1862 as the U.S. Brewers Association, BI is committed today to developing sound public policy and to the values of civic duty and personal responsibility.\n\nBrewers’ Commitment to Nutritional Transparency\n\nThe beer industry prides itself on innovation in product development and forward-thinking, consumer-focused actions. We are proud of our members’ products and brewers’ commitment to transparency through the [Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI](https://www.beerinstitute.org/policy-responsibility/policy/voluntary-disclosure/)). VDI is a pledge by the nation’s leading brewers to provide consumers with information about the alcohol beverage products they choose to consume. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have led the way in embracing TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. The program has been a resounding success — more than 95 percent of the beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers voluntarily includes nutrition, ingredients, alcohol content, and freshness dating, setting an unparalleled standard in transparency within the alcohol industry. These disclosures help consumers make responsible, informed decisions about what they drink and highlight the fundamental differences between distinct types of alcohol beverages.\n\nAs a threshold matter, TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If TTB made the rules for light beer and the voluntary rules in VDI, in use by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers, mandatory for all alcohol products it regulates, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Reduced lead time and compliance costs would be additional benefits, as most of the beer volume currently in the marketplace already complies with TTB Ruling 80-3 or TTB Ruling 2013-2 in terms of labeling.\n\nWhat follows are comments on specific issues, questions, and proposals raised in NPRM 237.\n\n* 1. Which title, “Serving Facts” or “Alcohol Facts,” would be more informative to consumers? Does the title “Alcohol Facts” better describe the information provided in the proposed statement, which includes per-serving alcohol content information?\n\nBI Response: “Serving Facts” is more accurately descriptive than “Alcohol Facts.” The term “Serving Facts” reflects the presence of more than just information about alcohol content. “Serving Facts,” which is the term widely used by brewers, provides information about alcohol content, calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Consumers would be confused by an Alcohol Facts descriptor that goes beyond alcohol content. This term would also significantly increase compliance costs by altering a widely used disclosure.\n\n* 1. Would the use of the title “Alcohol Facts” affect compliance costs or regulatory burdens by requiring a title change for products already voluntarily labeled with a “Serving Facts” statement?\n\nBI Response: Yes, compliance costs and regulatory burden would increase significantly for many brewers. In addition to changes in packaging, brewers already adopting TTB Ruling 2013-2 would need to change Point of Sale (POS) and other advertising.\n\n* 1. Are consumers accustomed to ﬁnding nutrient content information in a Serving Facts statement?\n\nBI Response: For over a decade, many brewers have voluntarily included the Serving Facts statement on their labels.\n\n* 1. Would changing the title to “Alcohol Facts” cause confusion?\n\nBI Response: Yes. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume. Alcohol content disclosure placement should also be flexible – either as part of a Servings Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label, and the widely understood abbreviation “ABV” should be permissible.\n\n* 1. Does the title “Alcohol Facts” make it easier for consumers to readily distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items?\n\nBI Response: No. “Alcohol Facts” is an unfamiliar term for consumers that does not actually reflect the information disclosed: calories, carbs, protein, fat, and alcohol content. It is unnecessary to use the term “Alcohol Facts” to distinguish alcohol beverages from other food items, as there are other sufficient indicators that the product contains alcohol on the label.\n\n* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether other elements of the Alcohol Facts statement should be optional rather than mandatory, and whether additional elements should be added to the statement on a mandatory or optional basis.\n\nBI Response: The BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative (VDI) is the nation’s leading brewers’ pledge to include average analysis or “Serving Facts” statements consistent with TTB Ruling 2013-2. For the past twelve (12) years, BI member brewers have embraced TTB Ruling 2013-2 regarding nutritional disclosures and disclosing alcohol content and ingredients on the label, secondary packaging, or via easily accessible digital platforms. BI supports using VDI as the mandatory standard for disclosure of Serving Facts. Again, Serving Facts, not Alcohol Facts, is the recognized and appropriate descriptor for these disclosures.\n\n* 1. TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether TTB should harmonize its nutrient labeling requirements with regulations issued by FDA, as updated in 2016.\n\nBI Response: No. FDA regulations address a much broader set of public policy goals for nutritional disclosures, many of which are not necessary or appropriate for alcohol beverage products (e.g., vitamin content). The Serving Facts panel works well for the unique characteristics of alcohol beverages.\n\n* 1. TTB seeks further comments, speciﬁcally comments with market data, on whether any micronutrients, such as sodium, are present in alcohol beverages in sufficient quantities that their disclosure would affect purchasing or consumption decisions, and if yes, whether TTB should require, or permit optional, inclusion of those nutrients on alcohol beverage labels.\n\nBI Response: While market data is not readily available, most micronutrients are seldom present in TTB-labeled alcohol beverages. As such, the disclosure of micronutrients should be optional.\n\n* 1. TTB also seeks comments on whether certain nutrients should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. TTB is proposing to require the listing of calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein content on alcohol beverages, even if the product does not contain, or contains only a de minimis amount of, these components. However, TTB speciﬁcally seeks comments on whether fat and protein, which are not typically found in certain alcohol beverages, should be listed only if present at speciﬁc levels. If so, what levels should trigger these requirements? TTB also seek comments on whether any other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, should be required to be listed if present at a speciﬁc level, even if they do not otherwise have to be disclosed.\n\nBI Response: Current Serving Facts statements include calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and there is no need to change the existing approach, which is widely used by the brewing industry and understood by consumers. Voluntary disclosure of other nutrients, such as sodium, caffeine, or sugar, may be the best approach for alcohol beverages.\n\n* 1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?\n\nBI Response: No. FDA labeling requirements address wider public policy goals for the broader food category. Requiring a Nutrition Facts Label on alcohol beverage products would be overwhelming relative to the limited scope of nutrients in alcohol beverages.\n\n* 1. Do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it unnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction?\n\nBI Response: Yes. Adopting the type of nutrient labeling required on FDA food labels for alcohol beverages falling under TTB’s labeling authority is unnecessary and potentially misleading. See also the answer to Items #12 and 13 below.\n\n* 1. Would information on the percentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful information for consumers?\n\nBI Response: While context matters, statements regarding the percentage of daily value of listed nutrients would not be helpful information for consumers, as consumers do not typically consume alcohol beverages for nutrient value.\n\n* 1. Could statements [regarding percentage of the daily value of listed nutrients] mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements?\n\nBI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for nutritive value. Moreover, existing regulations restrict or prohibit health claims concerning alcohol beverages.\n\n* 1. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be allowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further breakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)?\n\nBI Response: Statements of Average Analysis and Serving Facts labels allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2, and widely implemented by the BI through VDI, have long been in use, are familiar to consumers, and provide consumers with the information they need about alcohol beverages. Any additional information should be voluntary.\n\n* 1. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such as trans-fat and dietary ﬁber) be useful or potentially misleading?\n\nBI Response: The inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected in alcohol beverages is of no utility and could be confusing to consumers.\n\n* 1. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol beverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create an erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts?\n\nBI Response: While context matters, consumers who choose to drink alcohol beverages do not consume them for their vitamin or mineral content. Moreover, existing regulations prohibit health claims for alcohol beverage products.\n\n* 1. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in advertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)?\n\n# BI Response: BI estimates that 95% of the beer volume sold in the U.S. by the nation’s largest brewers already includes serving facts information on the label. Under federal law, restaurants with twelve or more locations must also provide consumers with calorie information on menus and nutrient content information on request.\n\n* 1. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might consumers beneﬁt from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol Facts labeling? How do those beneﬁts compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with such revisions?\n\nBI Response: Consumers can already see serving facts information on beer labels. TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 (for all other alcohol products regulated by TTB) address the issues raised by NPRM 237. If the rules for light beer and VDI – used by BI members since 2016 and already well understood by consumers – became mandatory for all alcohol products regulated by TTB, the Bureau could cleanly and efficiently accomplish the policy goals stated in its Notice. Added benefits include reduced lead time, compliance cost, and less overall regulatory burden, as most beer volume currently in the marketplace already includes Serving Facts statements.\n\n* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol beverage market?\n\nBI Response: Consumers have been receptive to BI’s Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, which BI believes enhances competition in the alcohol beverage market.\n\n* 1. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, new businesses entering into the alcoholic beverage marketplace?\n\nBI Response: While 95% of US beer volume sold by the nation’s largest brewers already includes disclosure of serving facts, some brands will need time to alter their labels. TTB’s proposed 5-year implementation will allow sufficient time to do so. For new businesses entering the alcohol beverage market, knowing the nutrition disclosure requirement, but on an extended time basis, should help with planning and execution.\n\n* 1. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of alcohol beverages?\n\nBI Response: Brewers may import brands under license, with those licenses affecting their ability to alter labels. Codifying voluntary standards set for the TTB Ruling 2013-2 and allowing a five-year implementation timeline should allow sufficient opportunity to amend license agreements. Of course, nutrition label requirements for products sold outside of the U.S. would not be subject to these labeling requirements.\n\n* 1. TTB is proposing to modify the tolerances set out in the 2020 guidance by eliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice limitations."" Instead, TTB is proposing an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat…. TTB seeks comments on whether the proposed tolerances are broad enough to facilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating calorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to consumers. Speciﬁcally, TTB seeks comments on whether it should instead propose the same tolerances set forth in TTB Procedure 2020-1 or whether another approach should be considered.\n\nBI Response: TTB Procedure 2020-1 follows FDA guidelines and has been in place for several years. Its continued application is appropriate.\n\n* 1. For beers that are not deﬁned as “malt beverages” under the FAA Act, TTB is proposing to mandate an alcohol content statement on the label of the products under TTB’s IRC authority. However, these beers would not be subject to the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements, including the requirement for a statement of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, because the Alcohol Facts labeling requirements are being proposed under TTB’s FAA Act authority, which does not apply to these products. Instead, these products are subject to FDA labeling requirements. TTB believes that requiring an alcohol content statement on these products would facilitate revenue. The Beer Institute and the Brewers Association made substantially similar comments in response to Notice No. 232. protection by, among other things, making it readily apparent that the products are subject to tax under the IRC. TTB seeks comments on this issue. TTB also seeks comment on the proposal to increase the labeling tolerance to one percentage point above or below the stated amount for all malt beverages and beers. TTB seeks comment on whether increasing the tolerance for alcohol content to one percent would lower the cost of compliance for a mandatory alcohol content disclosure and thereby promote competition in the marketplace if such disclosure is required. TTB also seeks comment on whether consumers would receive adequate information about the alcohol content of malt beverages if the tolerance were increased.\n\nBI Response: Applying a basic alcohol disclosure standard – like the mandatory and voluntary standards already in place and adding alcohol by volume to all “IRC Alcohol beverages” is appropriate and consistent with the goals of consumer-centric disclosures. Flexibility in the location of disclosure is essential. Furthermore, alcohol by volume is the form of alcohol content disclosure that consumers recognize and understand across all types of alcohol. Adding fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol as an additional statement, particularly if mandatory, would confuse consumers and contradict the aim of this rulemaking.\n\nAs for increasing the labeling tolerance for malt beverages from 0.3% to 1.0%, BI continues to caution against this change, as there is substantial risk of misinforming consumers about the alcohol content of malt beverages. If TTB believes an increase in tolerance is appropriate for malt beverages, BI suggests increasing the tolerance from .3% to .5%, providing greater flexibility to brewers while still providing accurate information about the alcohol content they are consuming.\n\n* 1. TTB seeks comments on this issue and speciﬁcally invites comments on whether an Alcohol Facts statement should be required for non-alcoholic malt beverages.\n\nBI Response: A Serving Facts statement, not an Alcohol Facts statement, makes sense for non-alcoholic malt beverages, so long as brewers can maintain flexibility in terms of the statement\'s location.\n\n* 1. What are the potential beneﬁts to consumers and industry members from a requirement for alcohol content statements, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, on the labels of all alcohol beverage products?\n\nBI Response: Alcohol content, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, is valuable information for consumers, and BI supports its inclusion on all alcohol labels. Alcohol by volume is straightforward, recognized, and understood by consumers. Additional statements of alcohol content, such as fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol are neither straightforward nor well understood by consumers. BI does not support additional statements of alcohol content on labels.\n\n* 1. Will the proposed requirement for alcohol content labeling for all beer and malt beverages result in additional costs and burdens for brewers and importers, particularly small businesses?\n\nBI Response: The answer to this question will depend on the disclosure criteria and time to comply. A simple requirement for an alcohol by volume statement should not pose a particularly high or onerous burden for brewers, especially if provided sufficient time to comply (*e.g.,* 5 years). A “fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol” or “total alcohol” disclosure requirement will pose a greater burden, not provide any recognized useful information, and confuse consumers.\n\n* 1. Will the proposed increase in alcohol content tolerances for malt beverages mislead consumers?\n\nBI Response: An increase in alcohol content tolerance from .3% to 1.0% is too much and will misinform consumers when a producer uses the full tolerance. If TTB believes it must provide additional flexibility, BI recommends only a minor increase in the tolerance level, such as from .3% to .5%.\n\n* 1. Do the proposed labeling requirements for non-alcoholic malt beverages adequately advise the consumer that the products contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume?\n\nBI Response: Yes.\n\n* 1. Should non-alcoholic malt beverages be exempted from calorie and nutrient labeling requirements?\n\nBI Response: No.\n\n* 1. Would an alternative that allowed table wines to indicate alcohol content as a range (e.g., 7–14 percent alcohol by volume) place less of a burden on small wineries and importers? Would this approach provide sufficient information to consumers?\n\nBI Response: BI does not support statements of alcohol content expressed as a range on any alcohol beverage products. This would not be sufficient information for consumers.\n\n* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?\n\nBI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. Suppliers should maintain the flexibility of label placement to minimize additional regulatory burden and associated compliance costs.\n\n* 1. Alternatively, should TTB allow alcohol content labeling as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?\n\nBI Response: TTB should require disclosure of alcohol content, expressed as alcohol by volume, on labels, with the flexibility of placing it as part of a Serving Facts disclosure or elsewhere on the label.\n\n* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect compliance costs and regulatory burdens? If so, how?\n\nBI Response: Disclosure of alcohol by volume with flexibility in placement should not materially increase compliance costs or regulatory burdens.\n\n* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?\n\nBI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition. However, if TTB determines that a Serving Facts statement should include alcohol content, an alcohol-by-volume format is the appropriate disclosure format.\n\n* 1. Would it be easier for consumers to locate alcohol content information on a label if it is required to be included in the Alcohol Facts statement and if so, why?\n\nBI Response: Consumers usually see alcohol by volume disclosures separate from Serving Facts disclosures on the label. There is no reason to change that practice.\n\n* 1. Should TTB allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of the Alcohol Facts statement?\n\nBI Response: It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow the use of alcohol per serving as an optional element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. First, there are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits. There is no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should similarly reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not. The myth of a “standard drink” is merely a self-serving argument used by those who want regulators and legislators to ignore the reality that consumers do not consume malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits the same. It is a device used to secure tax and marketplace advantages, not a known and tested method of communicating to consumers about the alcohol content of what they are drinking.\n\n* 1. Does the placement of alcohol content information affect costs of compliance and regulatory burdens?\n\nBI Response: Yes, if the placement or form of alcohol content information changes. The industry is well-positioned to continue reflecting Serving Facts information on primary and secondary packaging or near the net contents information on both primary and secondary packaging display panels. However, compliance costs and regulatory burden will increase if the requirements change.\n\n* 1. Does the proposal to require alcohol content information as part of the Alcohol Facts statement affect competition or issues addressed by international trade agreements or international standards?\n\nBI Response: We do not see the disclosures allowed by TTB Ruling 2013-2 as adversely affecting competition.\n\n* 1. Would including information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement improve the ability of consumers to follow the consumption and moderation advice provided by governmental and health agencies, if they so choose?\n\nBI Response: The amount of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving does not provide any additional useful or relevant information to the consumer. This information will only serve to confuse consumers. Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended for a single serving. This reference amount for beer and a disclosure of alcohol by volume provide the information consumers need to follow consumption and moderation advice.\n\n* 1. Would requiring information about the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving in the proposed Alcohol Facts statement impose additional costs or burdens for alcohol beverage manufacturers and importers, particularly for small businesses?\n\nBI Response: Yes. BI is unaware of any brewers today who are providing a statement of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol. To include such a requirement would force label changes for the majority volume of beer in the market today, which already provides alcohol content statements expressed as alcohol by volume. Furthermore, this information would only serve to confuse consumers who already widely understand alcohol content expressed as alcohol by volume; therefore, the regulatory costs and burden increase with a negative return on consumer protection.\n\n* 1. Is there a better way of presenting the volume of alcohol content per serving? Specifically, should the term “standard drink” be defined and used in place of or in addition to fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving?\n\nBI Response: This question assumes consumers are ill-informed about alcohol content, but the simplest and most efficient way to inform consumers about the alcohol content of the product they purchase is to mandate the alcohol content statement expressed as alcohol by volume. Consumers already understand this format, and many industry members, including the nation’s largest brewers, express alcohol content for their products this way. It is challenging to reconcile TTB’s goal of providing non-misleading labeling rules with the proposal to allow alcohol per serving or “standard drinks” as an element of a nutrition disclosure for alcohol. There are significant differences between malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits, and no standard for calculating a uniform serving size for all these products that matches how consumers consume them. TTB should reject using a “standard drink” measurement, which presumes that all alcohol is the same; it is not.\n\n* 1. TTB notes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, use the terms “drink,” and “alcoholic drink equivalent,” and seeks comments on whether any of those terms should be used or defined for use on labels.\n\nBI Response: TTB should mandate the statement of alcohol content on all alcohol beverage labels in the alcohol by volume format. This information, together with beer typically purchased in a 12-oz. container representing a single serving, provides sufficient information for consumers to moderate their alcohol consumption if they consume beer.\n\n* 1. Would consumers have trouble locating Alcohol Facts information if that information is presented in a linear display?\n\nBI Response: No. Brewers commonly use linear displays to present statements of average analysis and Serving Facts disclosures permitted by TTB Ruling 2013-2. This method is suitable since alcohol beverage labels are small. The FDA also permits linear display on space-limited labels.\n\n* 1. Does the proposal to require the linear display to appear in a box with the title “Alcohol Facts” in bold-face type allow consumers to better locate the information?\n\nBI Response: A box format is not an issue; however, the proposed title is a significant concern to the beer industry. The problem, as articulated throughout these comments, is the use of the term “Alcohol Facts” versus the current (and more accurate) term, “Serving Facts.” Moreover, we would like to maintain flexibility in terms of placement of the disclosure of alcohol content.\n\n* 1. Alternatively, should industry members be allowed the ﬂexibility to include a linear display that is not surrounded by a box?\n\nBI Response: Yes.\n\n* 1. Do consumers, industry members, or other interested parties have comments on the type size and general formatting requirements proposed for both linear displays and panels?\n\nBI Response: The requirements of the current voluntary Serving Facts statement are adequate.\n\n* 1. How would the proposed formatting requirements, including the linear display option, affect the costs and other regulatory burdens? What are the beneﬁts of the proposed formatting requirements?\n\nBI Response: Changes to formatting and display will adversely affect compliance costs and other regulatory burdens if they change the standards outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2. Brewers have been following TTB Ruling 2013-2 since 2016. It makes no sense to require them to incur additional costs by changing, without compelling cause, the nature and content of disclosures.\n\n* 1. Should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for mandatory statements of alcohol content for wine and malt beverages that appear in an Alcohol Facts statement?\n\nBI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across wine and malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.\n\n* 1. For malt beverages, should TTB remove the maximum type size limitation for alcohol content statements that may appear elsewhere on the label as well?\n\nBI Response: TTB should encourage consistency across malt beverages. The current minimum and maximum type sizes provide a baseline and consistency.\n\n* 1. What alternatives exist to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers?\n\nBI Response: TTB might consider allowing QR codes for voluntary disclosures only.\n\n* 1. How, if it all, would the alternatives affect competition in the marketplace as compared to displaying the information as proposed on the physical label?\n\nBI Response: The question should not be whether alternatives affect competition in the marketplace, but whether alternatives provide consumers with access to information about the products they purchase. If giving information to consumers is the goal, competition in the market may be a secondary consideration, at best. QR codes offer flexibility but are inappropriate for mandatory disclosures. TTB should limit the use of QR codes to voluntary disclosure of information only.\n\n* 1. What are the costs and beneﬁts of aligning Alcohol Facts information to requirements of other countries?\n\nBI Response: BI sees no benefits to aligning nutrition and alcohol content disclosures in the United States with requirements from other countries with different laws and regulatory structures. The costs of compliance and regulatory burden would increase, and consumers in the U.S. may be more confused than informed by labeling requirements imported from other markets.\n\n* 1. If TTB adopts mandatory Alcohol Facts labeling for alcohol beverages, should it include the option of satisfying the requirement by making the information available electronically, for example by including a QR code or website address on the label to allow consumers to view mandatory Alcohol Facts statements on their mobile devices instead of on the product label?\n\nBI Response: Yes, but for voluntary disclosure of information only.\n\n* 1. Would this option provide consumers with sufficient access to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, given issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges? Would the provision of mandatory information disclosures via electronic means create disproportional barriers to access for particular communities?\n\nBI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the label. TTB should limit the use of electronic disclosures to voluntary information disclosures only.\n\n* 1. How would the option of disclosing the proposed Alcohol Facts information via electronic means affect the costs and other regulatory burdens?\n\nBI Response: Flexibility in disclosing voluntary nutrition information via electronic means would decrease the cost of compliance and regulatory burden. Mandatory information should be on the label.\n\n* 1. If TTB were to allow mandatory information to be disclosed electronically, should TTB allow all of the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed electronically or should some of the information be required to appear on the physical label?\n\nBI Response: Mandatory disclosures should be on the physical label. TTB should, however, allow for voluntary disclosure of information by electronic means.\n\n* 1. If TTB allowed multiple options to convey Alcohol Facts information to consumers, could the lack of uniformity create consumer confusion?\n\nBI Response: BI members appreciate flexibility, but too many options to convey nutrition and alcohol content information could confuse consumers and prevent them from obtaining this information about all alcohol products.\n\n* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts a reasonably accurate representation of the amount of the product customarily consumed as a single serving?\n\nBI Response: Consumers typically purchase beer in a 12-oz container intended as a single serving.\n\n* 1. What data or other information should TTB consider that would give a better estimate of the amount customarily consumed for a speciﬁc product category?\n\nBI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. The 12-oz container should continue as a serving size reference for beer.\n\n* 1. Are the proposed reference amounts more accurate than the serving sizes set forth in TTB Ruling 2004–1 (1.5 ﬂ oz for distilled spirits, 5 ﬂ oz for wines, and 12 ﬂ oz for malt beverages, regardless of the alcohol content)? Why or why not?\n\nBI Response: Consumers customarily encounter beer in 12-oz containers, intended as a single serving. Servings of wine and distilled spirits often vary based on recipe and glass size. For example, a cocktail may contain three or more “servings.” Moreover, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1 to allow for accurate comparison of scientific studies, not as a consumer-facing tool. Granted, specific industry sectors argue that these serving sizes “prove” that all alcohol is the same. However, consumers do not understand and rarely apply that argument, which those industry sectors advance to secure beneficial tax rates and other marketplace advantages.\n\n* 1. Should TTB allow greater ﬂexibility in serving sizes?\n\nBI Response: While consumer behavior does not always match the serving sizes outlined in TTB Ruling 2004-1, providing “flexibility” in serving size would create consumer confusion.\n\n* 1. Should the serving size reference amounts be precisely equal to an alcoholic drink equivalent of 0.6 ﬂuid ounces of alcohol, or would this mislead consumers by not recognizing how alcohol beverages are typically consumed?\n\nBI Response: Using “standard drink” or “drink equivalent” measurements of 0.6 fluid ounces is misleading and confusing. Except for beer, this measurement does not reflect how consumers pour or drink alcohol. It introduces an entirely new measurement standard without credible support that is more useful than the existing approach.\n\n* 1. Does dual-column labeling create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol beverage at one time is expected or recommended?\n\nBI Response: No.\n\n* 1. Should dual-column displays be limited to containers with three or fewer servings, consistent with the FDA regulations? Or is a limit of less than ﬁve servings better suited to the way in which alcohol beverages may be bottled and labeled?\n\nBI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.\n\n* 1. Should dual-column displays be allowed on any container, regardless of the number of servings in that container, consistent with TTB Ruling 2013–2? The proposed rule would require containers with a net content of more than 100 percent but less than 200 percent of a single serving size reference amount to be labeled as containing a single serving. TTB solicits comments on whether this is the best way to convey the alcohol and nutrient content of these products to consumers.\n\nBI Response: There is no good reason to change the current voluntary standards of TTB Ruling 2013-2, except to make them mandatory.\n\n* 1. How frequently do bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages typically change labels?\n\nBI Response: It depends on the products. There are products in the marketplace with labels that have remained unchanged for several years. Some of those products already comply with TTB Ruling 2013-2, while other labels will not change unless the requirements change.\n\n# How long do industry members need to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule?\n\n#\n\n# BI Response: It will depend on the rule. If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.\n\n* 1. Will 5 years provide enough time for small businesses to coordinate labeling changes required by regulatory changes with labeling changes that are planned in the ordinary course of business?\n\nBI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance.\n\n* 1. Is 5 years too long a compliance period? Should the compliance period instead be 2 years, 3 years, or another length of time?\n\nBI Response: If the rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance. Less time may not be adequate.\n\n* 1. If a ﬁnal rule is issued, will industry members begin implementation of the labeling changes in advance of the compliance date?\n\nBI Response: Industry members are likely to begin complying on a rolling basis, changing labels in the normal course of business. If the final rule makes TTB Ruling 2013-2 mandatory, most of the beer volume will already be compliant, and our experience shows that 5 years is sufficient time to expect compliance from the rest of the industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs noted above, assuming there will be a rules change as suggested by NPRM 237, BI strongly encourages the TTB to avoid the “Alcohol Facts” concept and codify the existing voluntary rules as outlined by TTB Ruling 80-3 (for “light” or “lite” beer) and the voluntary guidelines outlined in TTB Ruling 2013-2 and BI’s comments above.\n\nIf there are issues for which the TTB sought comment in NPRM 237 that BI does not explicitly address in this response, please consider BI’s introductory comment as the response to such inquiries. Additionally, BI reserves the right to amend these responses or to comment further as appropriate.'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0196,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-18 17:47:55,,False,Comment 193:  Beer Institute,09000064b8f0189c,2025-08-18 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,See attached file(s),med-bomp-huc4,,Comment(s),0,,,Washington,DC,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-08-15 04:00:00,1,2025-08-21 00:38:45,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,0,"[0, -1, -1]",0,-1,-1

Reg. 6654 (January 17, 2025)) \n \nDear Ms. Greenberg, \n \nOn behalf of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), a national trade \nassociation representing the nation’s leading distillers of all sizes and marketers of distilled \nspirits sold in the United States, we appreciate the opportunity to comment upon the Alcohol \nand Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) “Alcohol Facts” notice of proposed rulemaking and \nlook forward to a thoughtful evaluation by TTB as you consider regulations on this important \nlabeling proposal.  \n \nAs regulated producers, importers, and marketers of distilled spirits, we share the goal of TTB \nand the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act of providing consumers with meaningful \ninformation about the beverages they choose to purchase. It is from that shared objective that \nwe respectfully submit our views regarding the instant notice and it is for those reasons that we \ndo not support the Bureau\'s ""Alcohol Facts"" proposal as drafted either as an option or a \nmandatory requirement on container labels.  \n \nOf particular note, we urge the Bureau to consider the following key points: \n• Flexibility to electronically display Alcohol Facts information is critical;  \n• Anticipated costs associated will be signiﬁcant and not commensurate with the beneﬁts; \n• Standard drink metrics should be the preferred method of providing alcohol \ninformation; and \n• TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts in the nutrient content statements will \ncreate consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. \n \nIt is without doubt that this notice of proposed rulemaking is one of the most signiﬁcant \nundertakings by the Bureau in the last 20 years. It is critical that TTB promulgates a ﬁnal rule \nthat serves the public\'s interests, while also ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden \ndistillers, overwhelm agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confuse consumers. We believe this  \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 2 \n \n   \n \nproposal, if adopted, would not meet these objectives and urge the Bureau to reconsider \ncertain aspects to increase supplier ﬂexibility, reduce the ﬁnancial impact, and enhance \nconsumer clarity.  \n \nBelow we expound on these points and provide additional context that we hope the Bureau will \nconsider as it progresses with this rulemaking and its other labeling initiatives.   \n \nAreas of Greatest Concern \n \n1. Flexibility to Electronically Display Alcohol Facts Information Is Critical to the Success of This \nProposal  \n \nIf the Bureau wishes to ﬁnalize an actionable standard that can be accessible for consumers and \nimplemented without overburdening industry members, any new regulations should, at a \nminimum, allow for the ﬂexibility to use quick response (QR) code technology or website \nreferences on label to provide this information. As we heard during the listening sessions and in \nthe written comment period last year, the industry, both domestic and international, almost \nunanimously registered support for additional ﬂexibility, with regard to the use of QR codes or \nwebsite references, and detailed why this ﬂexibility was warranted and necessary. DISCUS \nstrongly urges the Bureau to consider introducing a QR code and/or website reference option \ninto this proposal.   \n \nAllowing the use of QR codes would signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬁnancial burdens for industry \nmembers to comply, provide eﬃciencies as they are already being utilized on bottles in the \nUnited States and across multiple international marketplaces for this purpose and can be geo-\ntagged for individual markets, and permit producers to quickly change the information without \nneeding to revise logistics and supply chain.  \n \nSpeciﬁc considerations regarding electronic display of Alcohol Facts information include: \n \nA. QR Codes Are Eﬀective, Consumer Friendly, and Would Not Disadvantage Certain \nCommunities \n \nWhile we understand and appreciate that the Bureau considered the issue of QR codes in \nresponse to comments received during the advance notice of proposed rulemaking last year \nand decided not to include a QR code option due to a concern that it “would create barriers for \nconsumer access, particularly for consumers in certain demographics and those living in rural \nareas,”\n1 we believe that these perceived barriers are not as large or insurmountable as others \nhave argued and that QR codes can be an accessible and sustainable source of providing \nimportant product information to consumers. From a consumer perspective, we believe using a \nQR code to access e-labels allows producers to provide the consumer with the requisite \n \n1 90 Fed. Reg. at 6671. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 3 \n \n   \n \ninformation, and in many cases, with even more fulsome detail than a physical label would be \nable to accommodate. For example, a 50 ml bottle can comfortably accommodate a QR code \nbut would not be able to ﬁt the proposed label and all of the other information required by \nboth federal and growing state regulations.  \n \nLargely due to the rapid expansion of QR codes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic over \nthe last ﬁve years, consumers have become extremely comfortable accessing important product \ninformation in this format for all sorts of consumer brands and services. Consumers are \nincreasingly aware that much more information than is shown on the product label can be \nfound by simply going to the brand’s website or scanning a QR code on the packaging. Indeed, it \nis now common for a consumer to look up a product online on their smartphone while in the \nstore shopping, rather than picking up the product to examine the label. \n \nIn the NPRM, TTB questions whether QR codes “[w]ould…provide consumers with suﬃcient \naccess to Alcohol Facts information at the retail store so that they can make informed decisions, \ngiven issues such as the need to use a smartphone, potential issues regarding the adequacy of \ncellular or Wi-Fi coverage at some retail stores, and other potential technological challenges.”\n2 \nWe would argue this format of presenting information is not prohibitive for today’s or \ntomorrow’s consumer, as according to Pew Research,3 over 90% of adult Americans own a \nsmartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet. In fact, many Americans can be \nconsidered “smartphone-dependent,” meaning digital is often the primary information pathway. \n \nEven amongst senior citizens, cellphone ownership is strong. In 2023, Consumer Aﬀairs found \nthat the vast majority of seniors own cell phones (94%) or smartphones (76%).\n4 Smartphone \nownership is only expected to grow as well, with future trends predicting that the number of \nAmerican smartphone users will increase to more than 364 million people by 2040.5 Regarding \ncell service, the three largest phone carriers today, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, each claim that \ntheir 4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the U.S. population, so consumers in both urban \nand rural areas should have the requisite cell service necessary to scan a QR code at the retail \nstore no matter where they are in the United States. One can only expect that by 2030, when \nthis ﬁnal rule would likely go into eﬀect, that these cell coverages and ﬁgures will have markedly \nincreased, further closing any potential gap in accessibility for QR codes in all parts of the \ncountry.  \n \n  \n \n2 90 Fed. Reg. at 6672-3. \n3 Pew Research – Mobile Fact Sheet, January 31, 2024, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-\nsheet/mobile/#who-owns-cellphones-and-smartphone; Pew Research – Internet, Broadband Fact Sheet.

Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 4 \n \n   \n \nRegarding concerns over those who do not own a smartphone being able to access this \ninformation if only available through QR code, many larger stores have scanning kiosks \ncustomers can use to learn more about products and consumers could always ask retail \nemployees for help accessing the information as well. No method of transmitting product \ninformation will be 100% accessible, however, as even on-label disclosures are not universally \naccessible for every community given language barriers, literacy challenges, or consumers that \nmight be visually impaired. QR code accessibility can actually help to close these gaps by \nproviding product information in diﬀerent languages and allowing auditory text-to-speech \naccess on devices.  \n \nOur position that QR codes would be accessible and beneﬁcial for consumers is not just based \non theory—these QR codes containing nutrient content information are currently deployed in \nretail locations across a wide variety of markets, including the United States. Based on one \nDISCUS member’s recent data, U.S. consumers are their most active QR scanning population \nacross markets, making up 18% of all scanners worldwide. In December 2024 alone, over 15,000 \nindividuals scanned just one company’s distilled spirits QR codes in the United States.   \n \nQR codes provide consumers with the ability to make even more informed purchasing decisions \nbecause they would potentially have access to more information than they would if information \nwas limited to what was physically available on pack, given space constraints. Based on member \nexperience with QR codes and electronic labels (""e-labels"") in other markets, we believe QR \ncodes provide consumers with suﬃcient access to Alcohol Facts information at retail without \ncreating disproportional barriers to access for particular communities. One member indicated \nthat they currently utilize QR codes across their entire portfolio for consumers to access e-\nlabels, and they have been successfully implemented on over half a billion bottles across 166 \nmarkets with tailor-made information in local languages to ensure consumer accessibility. These \ne-labels link to webpages that can include, for example, (i) information about the moderate \nconsumption guidelines issued by regional health authorities where the QR code is scanned, (ii) \nthe full list of nutritional information per portion and per 100 mL, (iii) basic information about \nthe company and relevant brand for the purpose of education, and more. \n \nIn that same paragraph of the NPRM referenced above, TTB “recognizes that access to \ntechnology and cultural norms surrounding the provision of information via electronic means \nare rapidly advancing and seeks comment on whether any ﬁnal rule should allow the proposed \nAlcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means.”\n6 If you looked back to \nconsumer QR code usage pre-2020, the numbers would look very diﬀerent to their level of \nintegration and usage now. By 2030, we may experience another leap in technological \naccessibility that accelerates the consumer experience with QR codes and cements the e-label’s  \n  \n \n6 Consumer Aﬀairs – Cell phone statistics 2025, available at https://www.consumeraﬀairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-\nstatistics.html. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 5 \n \n   \n \nrole in providing valuable product information across all consumer goods. This potential \noutcome is far more likely than seeing a decrease in digitally-communicated consumer product \ninformation.  \n \nAdditionally, overcrowded labels have been shown to not be helpful for consumers and do not \nserve the need of adequately informing them regarding product details or components. This is \nespecially salient for small container sizes, like 50ml bottles. Thus, requiring this additional \ninformation, in conjunction with other potential labelling details, such as allergens and \ningredients, to be placed on label could have the opposite eﬀect, whereby consumers simply \ntune out all information provided. Introducing such a requirement would be especially \nburdensome for small producers. In order to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry and the \nresulting reduced choice for consumers, regulation should not be overly prescriptive in terms of \nformat or compliance mechanisms. Rules should be easy to apply even for the smallest operator \nand should acknowledge the dominant mechanism consumers employ for learning about \nproduct information is via online searching.  \n \nIf the Bureau ultimately decides to allow QR code nutrient content statements, standards could \nbe set requiring explanatory text to accompany the QR code on-label, as well as how the \nresulting QR code website should appear. This might provide TTB more comfort that there is a \nmore uniform method of encountering this information on-label and on the ultimate landing \npage to help manage the consumer experience and expectations.  \n \nB. QR Codes Promote International Eﬃciencies, Export Potential & Geo Sensitivity  \n \nThe ﬂexibility QR codes allow also provides important international eﬃciencies and growth \nopportunities to more U.S. distillers by allowing for greater expansion into export markets. For \nexample, QR codes are sophisticated enough now to be made “geo sensitive,” allowing for \ndiﬀerent languages or information to be displayed based on the location where it is scanned.  \n \nThis ﬂexibility would also facilitate consistency across European markets, given the newly \nimplemented wine regulations and spirits commitment to place certain nutrient information on \nwebsites that can be accessed via a QR code on label. Other parts of the world also have \ndiﬀerent requirements than those proposed in the NPRM, and adoption of this rule will increase \nthe probability that U.S. labels aren\'t accepted into other markets, thereby requiring additional \nstickering or an even more burdensome process of relabeling bottles altogether. This, in turn, \nwill cause the management of additional SKUs and label creation, which equates to additional \ncost to bring products into international markets. These amount to market barriers that \ndissuade new entrants and directly impact competition.  \n \nAs spiritsEUROPE notes in their comment in this docket, the EU spirits sector created an \nambitious self-regulatory approach to provide consumers with energy information included on \nthe back label and the full nutrient content information (including fat, carbohydrates and Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 6 \n \n   \n \nprotein) made available via a QR code present on the label. spiritsEUROPE’s latest report on the \nimplementation of the provision of this nutrition information from June 2024 shows that the \nshare of spirits with on-pack energy information and a QR Code has grown from 0% to 70% in \njust 5 years. In addition, over 900 spirits producers in the EU have created and activated close to \n40,000 QR code labels. They report that more than 75% of all spirits volume sold will feature e-\nlabels by the end of 2025 and that companies are also increasingly mirroring this approach \noutside of the EU, on a voluntary basis. Having this ﬂexibility in the EU to use QR codes, while \nrequiring all information on-pack here in the U.S. could have very real impacts on production \neﬃciencies and create undue ﬁnancial burdens for all companies participating in both markets.  \n \nAligning U.S. and EU requirements on displaying nutrient content information would be \nincredibly beneﬁcial for producers on both sides of the Atlantic, especially since the EU \nrequirements for wine have also been widely adopted by the spirits sector, including well \nbeyond the EU. Companies are already fully integrated into the QR space internationally and \nany large-scale deviation, particularly in the largest marketplace, would send shockwaves \naround the world and amongst the companies who have both U.S. and European brands.  \n \nC. QR Codes Promote Sustainable Practices and Cut Down on Label Waste \n \nA QR code or website option results in production eﬃciencies for distillers that provide this \ninformation in multiple markets around the world and also allows for greater ﬂexibility in \nmaking any necessary changes to the nutrient or ingredient information. With on-label \ndeclarations, if anything changes in the product formulation, it would require a large-scale \nlogistical eﬀort to reprint the labels that can take years to implement, swap out product in the \nmarketplace, and change marketing campaigns. Whereas with information provided via a QR \ncode or website, a change can be completed in real time with no physical waste through a \nsimple revision of the text on the webpage.  \n \nThese options help reduce unnecessary waste—allowing for this digital labeling could help save \nhundreds of thousands of labels, point-of-sale materials, and other marketing materials from \nbeing sent to the landﬁll anytime a product formulation changes. From a design and \nsustainability perspective, our members aim to reduce the size of paper labels across all \nproducts to minimize the materials used and impact on our environment. Utilizing QR codes \ninstead of Alcohol Facts statements would help producers avoid the need to create larger labels \nand thus a larger volume of materials needed.  \n \nHaving the ability to display this information through a digital solution allows for a more even \ndistribution of competition in the marketplace. Industry members can quickly pivot in the digital \nspace, providing real time information to the consumer. Label inventory management can be \nbetter controlled since there wouldn\'t be a need for obsolescence of labels when there are \nchanges to alcohol facts (e.g. a sugar reduction project which may only aﬀect calories and  \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 7 \n \n   \n \ncarbohydrate values). A digital solution also reduces the chances of there being multiple labels \nin market for the same brand as it goes through a reformulation. This, in turn, helps avoid \nconsumer confusion when they see labels with diﬀerent values side by side. \n \nOther areas of growing interest to consumers such as sustainability-related information on the \nproduct or re-use/recycling information can also easily be integrated into digital labels. For \nexample, in Italy, mandatory recycling information for glass bottles may be provided in a geo-\nlocalised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels. This is increasingly important even \ndomestically, as diﬀerent states adopt environmental or sustainability regulations requiring \ncertain label declarations. These eﬃciencies add up to keep the beverage alcohol industry aﬂoat \nand help smaller producers maintain their business amidst ever-changing regulations.   \n \nFor these reasons, we respectfully request the Bureau allow producers the option of utilizing a \nQR code or website reference to display any nutrient content information mandated by this \nproposal.  \n \n2. The Anticipated Costs Associated with This Proposal Will Be Signiﬁcant and Not \nCommensurate with the Beneﬁts \n \nDISCUS and its members greatly appreciate the Bureau’s thorough and detailed cost analysis \noutlined in the NPRM and eﬀorts to keep potential costs down for industry members, \nparticularly for smaller participants in the marketplace. TTB’s decision not to require product \ntesting and to provide a robust implementation period will go a long way to reducing the \npotential cost burden on producers resulting from this rule. However, the anticipated ﬁnancial \nimpact of this rule cannot be overlooked, as it will still be signiﬁcant and potentially unbearable \nfor some marketplace participants, especially given the current economic downturn in the \nindustry. Flexibility for producers, including the ability to utilize QR codes or website references, \nis critically important and would blunt much of these anticipated ﬁnancial hardships and allow \nfor a more reasoned implementation of this proposal.  \n \nA. Diﬃcult Moment in the Spirits Industry to Introduce Additional Regulatory Burdens \n \nThe distilled spirits sector, and overall beverage alcohol industry, is currently dealing with a \nmultitude of headwinds and external constraints, which have resulted in a constricting and \nincreasingly diﬃcult marketplace in which to operate. The slowing post-pandemic marketplace \nhas hampered U.S. spirits industry revenue, which decreased by $424M in 2024—a 1.1% year \nover year decline\n7—and these trends have only continued in 2025. According to the National \nBeverage Alcohol Control Association (NABCA), in control states, spirits dollar sales are down \n1.4% annually in the 12-month period ending in May 2025.\n8 Spirits imports from Canada and \n \n7 DISCUS 2024 Annual Economic Brieﬁng, available at https://www.distilledspirits.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FINAL-\nDISCUS-Annual-Economic-Brieﬁng-Presentation-2025.pdf. \n8 NABCA Monthly Report – May 2025 Control States Results. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 8 \n \n   \n \nMexico have also declined 16% in April and 18%9 in May in terms of dollar value compared to \nsame month a year ago and, from March through the end of April, sales of U.S. spirits in Canada \nplummeted more than 66%10, highlighting the growing trade-related challenges for the industry.  \n \nOperating a craft distillery already comes with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risks—with small margins, \nintense competition, distribution obstacles, challenges building brand equity, rising production \nand materials costs due to inﬂation and tariﬀs, and the daily responsibility of welcoming visitors \nto your distillery and tasting room and keeping your staﬀ paid on time. This economic \nenvironment has only exacerbated the ﬁnancial constraints on craft distilleries around the \ncountry. A quick Google search can highlight the sheer number of craft distilleries that have \nclosed or ﬁled for bankruptcy over the last several years, as they contend with these broader \nmarketplace challenges, which have resulted in craft spirits sales declining by volume and value \nin 2023 for the ﬁrst time.11  \n \nEven the larger multinational producers are contending with these economic headwinds by \ndownsizing staﬀ, selling oﬀ assets like brands and sites, and even pausing production at \ndistilleries around the world. The beverage alcohol industry has been navigating a challenging \nmarket for the last few years and is being further impacted by ongoing trade disputes. Staﬀ at \nbeverage alcohol companies, already dealing with team reductions in many cases, are also \nbeing tasked with navigating increasingly burdensome regulatory requirements, such as \nextended producer responsibility (EPR) initiatives across a number of states. With the larger \ncompanies simply trying to keep up with these evolving requirements, smaller producers are at \na distinct disadvantage as they most likely do not have internal compliance expertise and thus \nneed to engage costly outside consultants. \n \nGiven these myriad of challenges, it’s not hyperbole to posit that the adoption of this proposal \nwith the assumed costs discussed in the NPRM could lead to the closure of even more craft \ndistilleries and further attrition throughout the industry. The distilled spirits sector truly cannot \nwithstand any additional unplanned regulatory expenditures. \n \nB. Existing Voluntary Commitments Will Not Actively Reduce Potential Relabeling Costs  \n \nWhile TTB mentions that many industry members are already providing nutrient content \ninformation related to their products, which they argue should reduce overall costs for the \nindustry, this information is often being provided through a host of diﬀerent means and formats \nso label redesign will be inevitable for essentially all producers. The NPRM references the \nDISCUS Serving Facts Commitment as one such initiative. The DISCUS Commitment directs  \n \n9 United States International Trade Commission data. \n10 “Canada’s Boycott of US Liquor Hits Domestic Alcohol Sales,” Bloomberg.

Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 9 \n \n   \n \nmembers to provide “Serving Facts” information in either of the currently approved TTB formats \n(either serving facts panel or statement of average analysis) located either on the product label \nor on a company website with an on-label QR code or website reference.  \n \nMany DISCUS members elected to include this information via QR code or website reference to \nachieve the eﬃciencies detailed above. While they now have this nutrient content information \npublicly available online, our members would need to redesign their labels to include the \nstatement along with the rest of the industry. TTB states in the NPRM that their cost estimate \nmodel “assumes that 100 percent of brand name products can coordinate a regulatory label \nchange with a regularly scheduled label change within two years.”\n12  We can say from \nexperience that this assumption is false. Even for the DISCUS commitment, members needed at \nleast a two-year runway to eﬀectuate the QR code and website revisions, even with many \ncompanies already having much of the information for the products and a QR code on their \nlabels that could be repurposed for this commitment. This NPRM would be a much heavier lift \nto implement and would take substantially longer for companies to eﬀectuate.  \n \nEven if the proposed revisions to the Serving Facts label are adopted, such as the title change to \nAlcohol Facts and the mandated ABV and ﬂuid ounce information, those producers with a \nvoluntary Serving Facts label on their products will need to redesign every label to \naccommodate this new format. Every beer, wine, and spirits producer will need to incur some \nform of label redesign and printing costs, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of \nnutrient content information.  \n \nFor a coordinated labeling change (changes that can be coordinated with scheduled changes), \nTTB “estimates the costs per universal product code (UPC) would be $1,636.52 and for an \nuncoordinated distilled spirits labeling change over a ﬁve-year period it would be $10,427.36.”\n13 \nEven if we accept this cost estimate for a coordinated label change, some of our member \ncompanies have had thousands of active COLA registrations over the last 20 years and most \nhave diverse portfolios of wine, beer, and spirits products that would all need to be relabeled. It \nis clear that this proposal is likely to cost the industry millions of dollars—on the low end—and \ncould potentially hamper future innovation or personalization in label design with the prospect \nof increased costs and decreased ﬂexibility. TTB recognizes the potentially severe ﬁnancial \nimplications of this proposal when they “estimate the one-time total relabeling costs associated \nwith this proposed rule to be approximately $214 million (or $43 million per year) assuming a \ncompliance date of 5 years.”\n14  \n \nThe costs estimated by the Bureau most likely fall short of the actual costs of implementing this \nproposal and pose an unreasonable burden on industry members. Allowing ﬂexibility and a \ncost-eﬀective option in QR codes or website references is the only way that distilled spirits \n \n12 90 Fed. Reg. at 6679. \n13 90 Fed. Reg. at 6681. \n14 Id.  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 10 \n \n   \n \nproducers across the board can aﬀord to provide nutrient content information to consumers at \nthis present time. The beneﬁts of having the nutrient content statements on label as opposed to \naccessible through a QR code are not worth imposing these types of burdensome costs on \nproducers attempting to stay aﬂoat and keep their staﬀ employed.  \n \nC. Voluntary Testing Costs Should Be Included in TTB’s Cost Estimates   \n \nDISCUS agrees that the Bureau should be including the cost of voluntary testing in their cost \nanalysis estimates. While testing is thankfully not required in the proposal, industry members \nwill likely choose to test some of their products, either initially upon development or routinely \nas batches or formulas change to ensure accurate reporting of the nutrients on label. The \ntesting frequency and ultimate cost would vary depending on the size of the company, brand \nportfolio, and characteristics of the particular distilled spirits plant and/or production line.  \n \nMost distillers are small businesses and are not familiar with nutrient calculations, and any \nadditional compliance burdens can quickly become expensive hurdles for smaller players in the \nindustry. For example, many craft distillers may have to hire consultants or companies to handle \nthese label/formula elements for their brands, adding costs that they cannot aﬀord in an \nalready constricting and diﬃcult marketplace. As we heard from small distillers in the ﬁrst \ncomment period on these topics last year, even the act of redesigning and reprinting labels to ﬁt \nthis additional information will prove costly, as many do not design these in-house, with some \ndistillers in the listening sessions predicting it would cost them thousands of dollars to comply. \nWhile many craft distillers may utilize calculation methods and databases to prepare their \nnutrient content information, there will be a signiﬁcant proportion of them that will not have \nthe time or resources necessary to learn how to integrate these tools and will feel obligated to \nsend their products oﬀ to the lab for testing—often, as TTB notes in the NPRM, at several \nhundred dollars per test at many of the preeminent industry labs.  \n \nTTB themselves state that “[i]f…industry members will continue to send each product \nformulation for analytical testing each year, the ongoing annualized cost of the proposed rule \nwould be approximately $64 million.”\n 15 Even spread out over the vast numbers of distillers, \nbrewers, vintners, and importers in the United States marketplace, this recurring cost would \nplace an unnecessary burden on producers who are simply trying to comply with this regulation \nand ensure their data is accurate.  \n \nD. Potential for Signiﬁcant Burdens and Impacts on TTB Staﬀ  \n \nWhen considering new labeling proposals, it is critical to also ensure that any new regulations \ndo not overburden TTB staﬀ or create confusion for industry members, consumers, and the \nBureau alike. While this proposal would thankfully not require the submission of additional  \n \n15 90 Fed. Reg. at 6682. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 11 \n \n   \n \ncertiﬁcates of label approval (COLAs) to facilitate the inclusion of the nutrient content \nstatements, the Bureau still has the daunting task of ensuring industry compliance with the rule.  \n \nUnfortunately, we understand that the Bureau has undergone signiﬁcant attrition (over 20% \nagency wide) over the course of this year in response to the whole of government staﬀ \nreductions and early retirements, and that TTB is unable to backﬁll any vacancies due to a \nfederal hiring freeze until at least October. As a result, TTB staﬀ are being asked to do more with \nless and would have a diﬃcult time implementing and enforcing additional regulatory \nresponsibilities under these circumstances. While we would like to think TTB will have their \nstaﬃng and budgetary apportionments raised over the next few years, there is no indication \nthat this will be the case, and the Bureau should reassess the proposal through this lens. \n \nEven before the staﬀ losses in 2025, TTB, as a whole, had been experiencing signiﬁcant levels of \nattrition over the last several years, including losing roughly 15% of their workforce from 2020-\n2022 through a combination of retirements and other departures.\n16 This substantial attrition \nhas also been seen in the Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD) with the staﬀ tasked \nwith conducting these label and formula reviews. Adding increased label or formula \ncomponents will necessitate specialist review and experience and, thus, has the potential to add \nsubstantial burdens for TTB staﬀ and delays for industry members in the review and approval \nprocesses. The Bureau has demonstrated considerable positive gains in this area over the last \ndecade; delays and label returns have the potential to undo some of this progress, as they have \nsigniﬁcant impacts on product timelines and can upend routes to market, seasonal product \nreleases, state brand registrations, marketing campaigns, and production schedules. \n \nIf mandatory nutrient labeling is implemented, TTB will need to assess how to approach current \nlabels in the marketplace and how to ensure industry member compliance with the rules, both \nof which will inevitably lead to complicated implementation and procedural questions. Will TTB \nstaﬀ have the bandwidth and technical expertise to assess and review nutrient content \nstatements for accuracy? What’s to stop a bad actor from simply including arbitrary numbers on \ntheir labels? While it’s not cost eﬀective or feasible for TTB to test each product to ensure \naccuracy, there surely must be the need for some oversight and market compliance programs in \nplace, which will deplete the Bureau’s budget and staﬀ time. These technical considerations \ncould potentially increase burdens on TTB staﬀ and industry members alike and need to be \nthoroughly contemplated during this rulemaking process.  \n \nE. This Proposal May Be Inconsistent with Recent Deregulatory Executive Orders \n \nAnother consideration the Bureau will need to assess as they prepare a ﬁnal rule is the \nderegulatory priorities of the Trump Administration. In the Trump Administration’s Executive \nOrder on “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” (January 31, 2025), agencies have been \n \n16 2023 Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Annual Report, pg. 65, available at \nhttps://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/ttbar2023.pdf. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 12 \n \n   \n \ndirected to identify at least 10 prior regulations for elimination for each new regulation issued, \nas well as to “ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed \nregulations, being ﬁnalized this year, shall be signiﬁcantly less than zero.”  \n \nGiven the Bureau’s own extensive and substantial cost estimates included in the NPRM, it \nremains to be seen how this proposal could be ﬁnalized in its current form and comply with the \ndirectives of this Executive Order. There has been no proposal to eliminate any regulations to \noﬀset these new proposed regulations, which would need to be carefully evaluated. Further, \nTTB should evaluate any potential unintended consequences of eliminating regulations that \nindustry has become accustomed to and supports, as it could lead to other signiﬁcant issues. \nThe distilled spirits industry generally supports our regulatory structure, and we have based our \nentire business models around the current set of regulations. Doing away with 50 regulations, \nfor example, to implement this proposal could introduce a host of uncertainty and confusion.  \n \nWe respectfully suggest that oﬀering compliance ﬂexibility to regulated entities will be key to \nachieving that balance. Complicated and costly rules could be diﬃcult for industry members to \nunderstand and properly comply with. Providing industry members with several avenues to \ncomply with the regulations would be useful, given the various label designs, container sizes, \ninternational markets, and existing commitments that would be impacted by these regulations \nthroughout the industry.  \n \n3. Standard Drink Metrics Should Be the Preferred Method of Providing Alcohol Information \n \nDISCUS urges the Bureau to maintain its existing position related to the disclosure of ﬂuid \nounces of alcohol in Serving Facts statements. Listing the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving is \nan optional declaration under Ruling 2013-2 and should remain optional under this new \nscheme. Mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per \nserving by itself on every beverage alcohol product could be confusing for consumers and not \nuseful in helping them follow beverage alcohol moderation guidance.  \n \nConsumers will be confused how the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol relate to a particular serving of \nalcohol, so a consumer education campaign would be necessary if it were required to appear on \nevery label. And, unfortunately, standard labels do not have enough space to clearly articulate \nthe signiﬁcance of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. If producers wish to include it voluntarily as part of a \nbroader statement, however, along with standard drink information, the option should be \navailable to further educate consumers about the particulars of a standard drink.  \n \nIn lieu of mandatory information related to the ﬂuid ounces of alcohol per serving, DISCUS \nsupports the inclusion of standard drink information, either through text or the use of an icon, \nas part of any Alcohol or Serving Facts statement. Consumers have far more familiarity with \nstandard drink terminology than with the calculation of ﬂuid ounces of alcohol. And the  \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 13 \n \n   \n \ninclusion of standard drinks along with a recommended serving size will communicate \ninformation that facilitates responsibility, in a manner that is consistent with general consumer \nunderstanding. \n \nSince 1985, information about standard drinks has been a key part of the Dietary Guidelines for \nAmerican’s guidance on moderate consumption. Government experts and public health \norganizations – in the U.S. and worldwide – have long recognized the importance of providing \nstandard drink information. The Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, in \nconsultation with health experts around the nation, consistently have deﬁned a standard drink \nin the various editions of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as containing 0.6 ﬂ. oz. (14 \ngrams) of alcohol. Also provided in the Dietary Guidelines are examples of standard drink \nequivalents, such as 12 ﬂ. oz. of 5% ABV regular beer, 5 ﬂ. oz. of 12% ABV wine or 1.5 ﬂ. oz. of \n40% ABV (80 proof) distilled spirits. \n \nConsumers have become accustomed to framing their responsible consumption practices \naround these drink measurements. DISCUS believes inclusion of standard drink information in \nrelation to serving size nutrient content information will be a beneﬁcial tool for consumers and \nsuggests that an icon might be the most eﬀective way to communicate this, whether it is \nthrough a QR code scan or on label. An example of icons that TTB could look to emulate are \nthose currently in use in the Australian market:  \n \n \nThese icons clearly communicate to the consumer the approximate number of standard drinks \npresent in each package. We believe this might be the most eﬃcient and consumer friendly \nmethod to display alcohol per serving information, and TTB should explore mandating a \nstandard drink icon if they seek to ﬁnalize this proposal.  \n \nIn the NPRM, TTB also queries whether labels should include a summary of the Dietary \nGuidelines’ advice on moderate drinking that would be updated based on any changes in the \nguidelines over time. Although we support consumer education when it comes to moderate \nalcohol consumption, DISCUS does not support including moderate drinking guidance from the \nDietary Guidelines on spirits labels, given that this information would take up additional label \nspace and can change with the issuance of each new edition. The standard drink information or \nicon suﬃciently provides responsible consumption information. And, if information can be \nprovided via a QR code, the landing page would have space to provide information on the \nDietary Guidelines and can include a link to the Guidelines, themselves.  \n \nMs. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 14 \n \n   \n \n4. TTB’s Proposed Serving Size Reference Amounts in the Nutrient Content Statements Will \nCreate Consumer Confusion, Damage Brand Equity, and Impede Innovation \n \nWe respectfully submit that TTB\'s proposed approach to ""serving sizes"" as a basis for the \nNutrient Content Statement is ﬂawed: mandating proposed serving sizes (based on Ruling \n2013-2) for many current and future products would be confusing to the consumer and \ndamaging to brands, as it is contrary to how it is intended to be enjoyed. It will also impede \ninnovation based on consumer trends, such as the current trend to provide lower ABV options. \nTTB’s proposed serving sizes seem to be centered around the assumption that the only means \nof drinking a wine, beer, or spirits product is straight, unmixed with other beverages. While this \nmay be mostly true for wine and beer products, it most certainly is not the case for distilled \nspirits products, which often serve as “ingredients” in a wide-range of cocktails. Accordingly, it is \nimperative that producers have more ﬂexibility in deﬁning the serving size for each product.  \n \nThe terminology “serving size” communicates to the consumer that this is the recommended \nserving that they should be consuming. TTB states that these serving size reference amounts are \nintended “only as a basis for the consumer to determine alcohol, calorie, and nutrient intake \nand not as a recommended consumption amount.”\n17  Most consumers will not understand this \ndistinction and will rightly assume that the serving size listed on the bottle refers to the \nrecommended amount that the consumer should pour into a serving. If the stated serving size is \n5 oz., the consumer will believe that a normal serving for that product is 5 oz. This could be \nmisleading and damaging to the brand equity for these brands and inadvertently lead to the \nconsumption of more alcohol. A few examples of this confusion and damage to brand equity are \noutlined below.  \n \nFirst, there are many liqueurs, cordials, and specialty products currently on the market that \nproducers recommend be enjoyed in a 2oz pour (sometimes as part of a cocktail), but would fall \ninto a 5 oz. required serving size in the current proposal. Recommending a 5 oz. pour would \nmake the experience less enjoyable and may turn a consumer oﬀ from the product altogether. It \nwould also increase the recommended amount of alcohol and calories, which is not the desire \nof producers or consumers, and we do not believe is the goal of the present rulemaking. The \nstated ABV cutoﬀs simply do not align with traditional serving sizes or how the manufacturer \nwould recommend that many products are consumed. \n \nProduct Serving Size Standard Drink (Per USDG) \nLiqueur – 11% ABV 5 oz. Serving Size (per \nproposal) \n.92 \n 2 oz. Serving Size (per \nproducer recommended \nserving) \n.37  \n \n17 90 Fed. Reg. at 6675. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 15 \n \n   \n \nSecond, there is also a growing trend to oﬀer lower ABV versions of popular products. If there is \na rigid serving size requirement based on ABV, there could be an unintended consequence of \nforcing a lower ABV product into the 5 oz. serving size which could have a greater amount of \nalcohol than the original full proof product with a serving size of 1.5 oz. See the example below, \nwhereby the current requirements would have the unintended consequence of recommending \na serving size for the lower ABV version that has 25% more alcohol than the serving size for the \nregular full-strength product.  \n \nProduct Serving Size Standard Drink (Per USDG) \nFull proof product – 40% \nABV \n1.5 oz. Serving Size  1 \nLower ABV Version – 15% \nABV \n5 oz. Serving Size (per \nproposal) \n1.25 \n 1.5 oz. Serving Size (per \nproducer recommended \nserving) \n0.38  \n \nThere has been growing interest in lower ABV alternatives to consumers’ favorite products and \nmandating this rigid serving size protocol will certainly chill innovation in that space and no \ndoubt other future areas of consumer choice that have yet to materialize.  \n \nThird, the proposed serving sizes will create confusion in the increasingly popular Ready-to-\nDrink (RTD) space, as there are a variety of ABVs and intended serving suggestions. For example, \ntwo nearly identical products – one at 7% ABV and one at 8% ABV – that are intended to be \nenjoyed in a similar fashion could result in a very diﬀerent suggested serving, with impacts to \nthe suggested alcohol and caloric intake.   \n \nProduct Serving Size Standard Drink (Per USDG) /  \nCalories \nRTD – 7% ABV 12 oz. Serving Size (per \nproposal) \n1.4 \n \nCalories: 137.2 \n 6 oz. Serving Size (per \nproducer recommended \nserving) \n0.70 \n \nCalories: 68.6 \nRTD – 8% ABV 5 oz. Serving Size (per \nproposal) \n0.67 \n \nCalories: 65.66 \n 6 oz. Serving Size (per \nproducer recommended \nserving) \n0.80  \n \nCalories: 78.4 \n Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 16 \n \n   \n \nInstead of mandating the 2013-2 serving sizes, we urge the Bureau to oﬀer producers the option \nto recommend the appropriate serving size for the product and not be forced to display serving \nsizes that may not ﬁt every type of product. This option is complementary to our suggested \ninclusion of standard drink information, which would clearly communicate the serving size as it \nis intended to be enjoyed, as well as the amount of alcohol in that serving in the context of the \nstandard drink (which as discussed above, will be easier for consumers to understand).  \n \nSpeciﬁc Comments on Other Aspects of the Proposal \n \nQuestions/Issues: \n \nI. Title of the Alcohol Beverage Information Statement  \n \nWith regards to the proposal to amend the title of the beverage alcohol information statement, \nwe do not see a reason to alter the existing “Serving Facts” terminology and merge these \nstatements under the “Alcohol Facts” moniker.  \n \nConsumers readily understand the terminology of “Serving Facts” and have been encountering \nthese statements on beverage alcohol products for over a decade now. Altering the title of \nthese statements now could lead to consumer confusion, especially considering that the title of \n“Serving Facts” better describes the nature of the information being presented to the consumer \nand that most producers, if looking to include additional consumer information on label, have \nopted to utilize the Serving Facts statement over the existing Alcohol Facts statement.   \n \nAs such, our members have indicated that a mandated change in the terminology to “Alcohol \nFacts” would increase compliance costs for products already containing a “Serving Facts” panel, \nas every label with a voluntarily ""Serving Facts"" statement would need to be revised. They \nwould incur ﬁnancial impacts for creating new print plates, printing new labels, and writing oﬀ \ncosts for ""Serving Facts"" labels that could no longer be used. One member indicated that this \nchange would aﬀect over 1,000 labels in their portfolio that would need to be revised from \n""Serving Facts"" to ""Alcohol Facts."" \n \nSwitching the terminology to “Alcohol Facts” would obscure the main purpose of providing this \ninformation to the consumer, which is to share the nutrient content information related to a \nserving of the product. We urge TTB to maintain the longstanding “Serving Facts” terminology. \n \nII. Mandatory Calorie and Nutrient Information \n \nA. A Host of Nutrient Content Information is Currently Available to Consumers  \n \nAs we detail in our submission last year, many spirits producers currently voluntarily provide \nnutrient information to consumers. In 2022, DISCUS Members committed to provide consumers Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 17 \n \n   \n \nwith nutrient content information, such as serving size, number of calories and grams of carbs, \nprotein, and fat per serving size, through either of the currently TTB-approved formats (Serving \nFacts panel or statement of average analysis) on new labels by June 2024.18 This information is \nnow available for all spirits products distributed in the United States by DISCUS Director \nMembers, either displayed directly on the label or via a URL or scannable QR code on the label.  \n \nThe majority of multi-national producers also provide nutrient content information on their \nbrand and corporate websites to satisfy voluntary commitments made in other markets, such as \nin Europe, as well as on some e-commerce platforms at the point of purchase.  \n \nBeyond what distillers provide directly, many governmental and private websites also provide \nserving fact information for categories of standards of identity, which generally do not vary \ndramatically across brand given the strict requirements on production, ingredients, and alcohol \ncontent. For example, the USDA FoodData Central database includes information for general \ncategories of beverage alcohol. The page for “Alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof” \nprovides that 1 ﬂ. oz. contains 64.2 kcals.\n19 As with most spirits products, the value for most of \nthe other nutrients for that product, including protein, fat, and carbs, is zero.   \n \nB. Harmonizing Nutrient Labeling Requirements with FDA Would Be Inappropriate and \nOverly Burdensome \n \nIn the NPRM, TTB asks for the industry’s views on whether they should seek greater \nharmonization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on nutrient content statements \nand if TTB should adopt FDA’s Nutrition Facts panel. DISCUS strongly supports TTB’s \nlongstanding jurisdiction over beverage alcohol labeling and the Bureau’s approach to nutrient \ncontent labeling and opposes adoption of the FDA’s nutrition labeling scheme.  \n \nWe believe that the many diﬀerences between distilled spirits and other non-alcohol beverages \nmake it unnecessary and even misleading to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on \nfood labels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction. One major concern is that listing the \npercentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients on an alcoholic beverage label could \nmislead consumers by implying that they may rely on beverage alcohol consumption to satisfy \npart of their daily nutrient requirements. There is no daily recommendation/Dietary Reference  \n  \n \n18 DISCUS Director Members announced this voluntary commitment to provide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products \nas part of the 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. The commitment by DISCUS Director Members to \nprovide “Serving Facts” information for spirits products empowers consumers to make healthy choices and foster environments \nthat enable people to make informed decisions. This commitment did not extend to DISCUS Craft Members, who may not have \nas many resources to dedicate to calculate and conform this information to TTB required speciﬁcations. It also does not extend \nto limited-run test products available on-site at production facilities and tasting rooms. \n19 US Department of Agriculture, Food Central Database, Vodka Page (August 13, 2025), available at \nhttps://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/174818/nutrients.  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 18 \n \n   \n \nIntake for alcohol. Distilled spirits producers would not in any way want to make that implication \non our brand labels and strongly oppose the inclusion of daily values on TTB-regulated \nproducts.  \n \nOn this point, it’s important to note that no other country requires daily value information for \nlisted nutrients on distilled spirits labels, so this would be a departure from common global \npractices. Over the past ﬁve years, our members indicated they have not received any consumer \ninquires for many of these nutrients, such as fat (including saturated fat and trans-fat), sodium, \nprotein, and cholesterol. This experience demonstrates that this information is not relevant to \nbeverage alcohol products or consumers and should not be required to be listed on labels. \n \nDISCUS also opposes mandated inclusion of any additional components that the FDA may \nrequire, like sodium, as they would not provide any value to the consumer given their typically \nlow or non-existent levels in beverage alcohol products.  \n \nThe adoption of FDA nutrition facts labels on TTB-regulated products would also impose \nsigniﬁcant costs and burdens on industry members as it would require extensive testing and a \ncomplete overhaul of existing labels, whereas the proposed statements could be implemented \nwith less disruption to label portfolios. Requiring a full FDA nutrition facts table would take up \neven more space on already limited labels and hamper competition throughout the industry. \n \nAdditionally, unlike most food and beverage products, spirits undergo a rigorous pre-approval \nprocess at TTB for their labels and formulas to ensure compliance with the Bureau’s rules and \nregulations. This pre-approval process is unique in relation to products by the FDA, where there \nis no pre-approval process before products can enter the marketplace. Beverage alcohol \nproducts under the FDA’s purview contain the full FDA nutrition and ingredients label, but they \nare not required to go through the same pre-approval process as those regulated by TTB and \nare only subject to post-market sampling enforcement eﬀorts to ensure product compliance and \nsafety.  \n \nAs part of its pre-approval process, TTB reviews every proposed label submission for all distilled \nspirits products, with a particular focus on whether the product meets its identiﬁed class/type \nand does not mislead consumers about the nature of the product. Through this review, TTB also \nessentially signals that spirits labels in the marketplace contain accurate and understandable \ninformation that consumers can rely on to make their purchasing decisions.  \n \nThe mandate of any additional information—either through TTB’s proposed statement or an \nFDA nutrition facts label—will inevitably be complicated by the pre-approval process and should \nbe carefully evaluated through that lens. In particular, there will be acute complications if \ninformation is required to be presented on the label (rather than via scannable QR code or URL)  \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 19 \n \n   \n \nand if the longstanding acceptable practice of providing ingredient ranges for formulas is \ndisallowed or compromised through the adoption of an FDA-like system of labeling ingredients \nin order of predominance.  \n \nReasonable timelines for formula and label approvals are key to manage industry member \nproduction, marketing, and state registration requirements. Additional delays or complications \nin this process could cause undue ﬁnancial hardships for industry members—hardships that \nother food and beverage products do not face in the FDA process with no prior approval. Testing \nfor nutrients, particularly if an FDA nutrition facts label was required, would be cost prohibitive \nfor the majority of industry members and would create signiﬁcant burdens on their operations. \nThis is particularly true for innovators that release several new brands or limited releases each \nyear. Formula ranges have been allowed for decades and shifting this policy now would create \nhavoc for every industry member who has a formula currently approved with the TTB, as these \nwould need to be revisited and altered.  \n \nC. Sugar Content Statements Should Remain Optional \n \nIn its NPRM, TTB proposed to allow optional sugar content statements as part of the Alcohol or \nServing Facts statement. DISCUS supports the optional inclusion of sugar content statements, \nconsistent with the current approach, and agree with its inclusion in the Alcohol or Serving Facts \nstatement if provided.  \n \nD. Inclusion of Micronutrients Should Remain Optional \n \nDISCUS strongly suggests that micronutrients should remain an optional inclusion. In most \ninstances, micronutrient values would be zero and would not provide consumer beneﬁt to being \nincluded in the Alcohol Facts statement but might cause consumer confusion.  \n \nE. Spirits Products Should Have the Ability to List Only Nutrients Present in the Product \n \nWe can appreciate the Bureau’s response to our previous comment on this topic in the NPRM \nthat “[w]hile certain alcohol beverages are unlikely to contain certain nutrients, such as fat or \nprotein, even the absence of these components provides information and may be of interest to \nconsumers.”\n20 While some consumers certainly may be interested in seeing the absence of \nthose components on the label, we believe the vast majority of consumers are well aware that \nwhiskey or vodka products, for example, do not contain any fat or protein. These nutrients are \nnot commonly associated with distilled spirits products, unless they contain cream or other \nsuch ingredients. Allowing the listing of calories alone on label for products without any other \nnutrients would also align the U.S. with the EU marketplace, creating additional eﬃciencies for \nexporters.  \n \n \n20 90 Fed. Reg. at 6665. Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 20 \n \n   \n \nAt a minimum, TTB should consider allowing producers to employ a short-hand version of the \nstatement for products containing only calories that identiﬁes the absence of other nutrients, \nwithout having to print the entire statement with only zeros. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein \nshould only be required to be included on label to the extent they are actually present in the \nproduct at certain levels. \n \nF. Vitamin or Mineral Statements Should Be Prohibited \n \nThe distilled spirits industry strongly opposes the inclusion of vitamin or mineral statements on \nlabels. We believe that including numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of \nalcohol beverages could create an erroneous impression to consumers that the consumption of \nbeverage alcohol has nutritional value or other health-related beneﬁts, or is part of their daily \ndietary needs. We know TTB strictly enforces potential health claims under the current \nregulations and allowing vitamin or mineral statements will only lead to increased confusion \naround health claims for both consumers and the Bureau. As such, we strongly recommend \nagainst including such a numerical statement.  \n \nIII. Calculating Panel Elements and Tolerance Levels \n \nIn this NPRM, TTB proposes modifying the tolerance levels outlined in TTB Procedure 2020-1 by \neliminating references to ""reasonable ranges"" based on ""good manufacturing practice \nlimitations"" and shifting to an objective standard, which allows a tolerance of 20% either above \nor below the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat. DISCUS supports this \nproposal.  \n \nThe proposed 20% above or below the labeled amount is reasonable and broad enough to \nfacilitate reliance on databases for standard products, among other methods for calculating \ncalorie and nutrient content, but still speciﬁc enough to provide accurate information to \nconsumers. Further clariﬁcation would be welcomed, however, on how the tolerance might \napply for products making speciﬁc calorie claims (e.g. ""only 100 calories.”) \n \nThe ability to continue to rely on databases and this updated tolerance will be critical for \nindustry compliance with this proposal. Relying on databases and calculators allows industry \nmembers to provide nutrient content information without conducting costly and burdensome \nlaboratory testing on each of their products, particularly for brand extensions that might have \nvariation in ABV from bottle to bottle, such as bottled-in-bond or barrel strength whiskies. TTB’s \ncontinued recognition that databases and calculation methods can accurately determine \nnutrient content information is appreciated and will help lessen burdens associated with this \nproposal and increase eﬃciencies with international markets.  \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 21 \n \n   \n \nIV. Mandatory Listing of Alcohol by Volume on all Alcohol Beverage Products  \n \nWhile we do not support mandating the inclusion of the number of ﬂuid ounces of pure ethyl \nalcohol per serving by itself on every beverage alcohol product, we fully support and applaud \nthe Bureau\'s proposal to require the disclosure of the alcohol content, expressed as a \npercentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), for all beverage alcohol products both under its \njurisdiction and FDA’s. By this action, TTB will ﬁnally require all regulated alcohol products to \nbear an alcohol content statement, which has long been required for all distilled spirits \nproducts. There’s no rationale to exempt certain beverage alcohol products from declaring their \nalcohol content on label while others are required to do so and the Bureau’s action will ensure \nconsumers can be increasingly aware of the alcohol content of their alcohol beverage of choice.  \n \nImportantly, TTB also proposed to mandate alcohol content labeling on non-alcohol beverage \nproducts, which DISCUS greatly supports. As the non-alcohol beverage space continues to \nbecome more popular, industry would welcome guidance on labeling requirements since many \nof these products may straddle TTB and FDA labeling requirements. Ambiguity in this category \nand proper regulatory authority has resulted in inconsistent labeling practices across the \nmarketplace. \n \nV. Placement of Alcohol Content Statements as Part of the Alcohol Facts Statement \n \nAs raised by the Bureau in the NPRM, we respectfully request that the alcohol content \nstatement not be mandated as part of an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement and that the \nalcohol by volume statement on the brand label remain the primary alcohol content statement \nrequired. Distilled spirits consumers are accustomed to interacting with ABV information in the \nsame ﬁeld of vision as other mandatory information on the front of most distilled spirits bottles, \nso moving the required statement onto an Alcohol or Serving Facts statement could lead to \nconsumer confusion or inconvenience. If this change was adopted, consumers will not, in most \ncases, readily be able to see the ABV statement while perusing product at a retail location as \nthey will need to turn container to look for the ABV disclosure in the Alcohol or Serving Facts \nstatement.  \n \nGiven that this would be an enormous departure from how distilled spirits labels have \nhistorically been organized, TTB does not provide suﬃcient rationale in the NPRM for why the \nAlcohol or Serving Facts statement is the appropriate mandatory location for this information or \nwhy a currently optional declaration under the voluntary scheme outlined by TTB Ruling 2013-2 \nis now becoming required. Current Serving Facts panels under the voluntary scheme are only \nrequired to list serving size, servings per container, calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  \n \nIf information related to serving size and the number of standard drinks per serving are included \nin the Alcohol or Serving Facts panel, this information is adequate, in terms of what a consumer \nneeds to help inform their responsible consumption. If the ABV is already stated in another Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 22 \n \n   \n \nlocation on the product, the producer should have the option and ﬂexibility to include it in an \nAlcohol or Serving Facts statement if they choose to do so. Producers wanting to maintain their \ncurrent label design and placement of the ABV on the front of the label should not be burdened \nwith displaying the same information twice on their label in order for it to be compliant with \nthis new scheme.  \n \nVI. Linear Display and Type Size of Alcohol Facts Information  \n \nA. Proposed Linear Display Increases Flexibility and Should Not Require a Box \n \nDISCUS appreciates the inclusion of a linear display option for the Alcohol or Serving Facts \nstatement, as this will increase the ﬂexibility for industry members in how they choose to \ndisplay the mandated information based upon their speciﬁc label characteristics and available \nspace. There is no reason to believe that the linear display option would be diﬃcult for \nconsumers to understand or locate on label, as TTB has essentially permitted a similar \nstatement for over 20 years. Consumers have become accustomed to engaging with statements \nof average analysis since the Bureau approved them in 2004 and, while they do not include all \nof the information outlined in this proposal, they do provide all of the nutrient content \ninformation included in the Serving Facts format, without a box surrounding the statement. \nGiven the similarities between this linear display and statements of average analysis, consumers \nshould be able to easily locate and understand this information.  \n \nDISCUS urges the Bureau to revise the proposal to make the box around both the linear and \npanel display Alcohol Facts statements optional. Given the amount of information being \nprovided in the statement, consumers will have no trouble locating these statements on the \nlabel. The box is another element that adds complexity to designing labeling that meets all \nmandatory requirements with limited space availability. The Bureau allows this ﬂexibility now, \nas many Serving Facts statements are provided on label without a box around them, and they \nare just as recognizable for consumers. TTB also pre-approves every label and will retain the \noption to send a COLA back for correction if a specialist felt a producer was trying to obscure or \nhide an Alcohol Facts statement. Industry members should be given maximum ﬂexibility to \ndecide how to best implement this proposal for their products - whether with a linear or panel \ndisplay, as well as where it is located on label.  \n \nB. Formatting and Type Size Requirements \n \nDISCUS agrees with TTB’s proposal that, if required on label, the type size for an Alcohol or \nServing Facts statement should be consistent with the existing mandatory disclosures. While \npertaining to beer and wine products only, DISCUS also supports the elimination of the \nmaximum type size limitation. \n  Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 23 \n \n   \n \nC. Cost Estimates for Linear Display  \n \nWhile we discuss the anticipated cost of this proposal in depth above, we would like to stress \nthat, even with a linear display allowance, each label will need to be reviewed and readjusted to \nﬁt this additional information. For those labels that are space constrained, dielines would have \nto increase for the inclusion of the Alcohol Facts statement, which could have a detrimental \nenvironmental and sustainability impact. Every statement option aside from a QR code would \npose a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden to update all product labels to include Alcohol Facts \nstatements. Among the on-pack options, the linear display format will impose the least burdens \nfor industry members because it takes up much less space, in what is already a limited area for \nmany of our products. This ﬁnancial impact would also decrease if the box around the linear \nand panel displays was made optional, as producers could then ﬁt the required information into \neven more space on the label.  \n \nVII. Dual-Column Alcohol Facts Panel Display \n \nDISCUS agrees that the dual-column alcohol facts panels should remain optional. We also agree \nwith TTB’s proposal to allow the dual-column format on alcohol beverages sold in containers \nholding at least 200 percent and less than 500 percent of the serving size reference amount, as \nthis would more accurately reﬂect the way in which alcohol beverages are bottled and labeled \nand how producers might want to utilize these panels. \n \nEducation may be needed, however, around the meaning of dual-column labels for the \nconsumer to correctly read and understand dual-column labels and to understand how the \nmanufacturer is intending the consumer to approach the servings shown. It’s possible that dual-\ncolumn displays could create the impression that consumption of multiple servings of an alcohol \nbeverage at once or in one sitting is expected or recommended. In other regions, such as the \nEU, most companies only provide nutrient content facts per 100mL measurements. With so \nmany diﬀerent serving sizes and container sizes in the US, it would be practically very diﬃcult \nfor companies to implement a dual-column display for every bottle size and SKU.  \n \nIn addition, if TTB does not allow Alcohol or Serving Facts statements to be provided by QR \ncodes, the amount of space required to print dual-column panels information can impact \nalready limited label space availability, so allowing producers the option of including a dual-\ncolumn display at their discretion rather than requiring it provides essential ﬂexibility.  \n \nVIII. Implementation Period \n \nThousands of brands will be aﬀected by this initiative, both domestically and internationally. \nGiven the global commerce in beverage alcohol products and the multitude of products that \nare imported into the United States, DISCUS appreciates the ﬁve-year phase-in period included Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 24 \n \n   \n \nin the proposal and believes that this implementation timeframe should be suﬃcient to \neﬀectuate the necessary labeling and branding changes. \n \nThis length of time will be essential to address label development and redesign, along with the \nassociated resources and outside expertise required in a label initiative aﬀecting the industry. \nDISCUS appreciates the Bureau not requiring resubmission of COLAs to include Alcohol or \nServing Facts statements, as this would greatly increase burdens throughout the industry and \nfor the Bureau’s ALFD staﬀ by creating a tidal wave of applications. A ﬁve-year phase-in \ntimetable for compliance provides a more orderly transition period across a company\'s brand \nportfolio - be it a large, medium or small portfolio and/or with ""fast moving"" or ""slow moving"" \nbrands. This timeframe would allow companies to transition to new labeling requirements in a \nstructured manner, which would beneﬁt all stakeholders. \n \nEven with this ﬁve-year implementation period, exceptions would need to be considered for \nlegacy products or products that have aged in bottle (e.g., ice wine, etc.). A waiver or other \nmechanic should be in place to help protect investments that may not comply. Further \nclariﬁcation is also needed regarding the exact mechanics of the ultimate compliance date and \nwhich products it could impact that are already in the marketplace. Would it only be applicable \nto new products produced after the ﬁnal rule goes into eﬀect? What about inventory sitting \neither in a warehouse or on a store shelf? Would existing inventory need to be reworked to \ncomply with the ﬁnal rule? These important questions demonstrate the realities producers will \nneed to contend with if this proposal is ﬁnalized, as well as the type of questions the Bureau \nshould be prepared to respond to either in the rule language itself or an accompanying FAQ \nguidance document.  \n \nIn the NPRM, the Bureau asked how frequently labels are changed on beverage alcohol \nproducts, and the answer truly diﬀers based on producer and brand. Each brand is unique in \nthe frequency that labels are changed. While not always the case, generally speaking, straight \nspirits brands change product labels less frequently than formulated products or certain \ncategories like ready-to-drink (RTDs). A shorter amount of time to comply than the proposed \nﬁve years isn\'t realistic given the uniqueness of each label. Each label size will need to be \nanalyzed and possibly reworked to provide enough space for the inclusion of an Alcohol Facts \nstatement. Labels may have to increase their dieline to meet the requirements, which from an \nenvironmental and sustainability practice introduces additional burden to the industry.  \n \nCompanies that choose to comply earlier obviously would be free to do so and, if QR code \ntransmission was permitted, we believe you would see a host of companies able to comply in \nvery quick order given the ease of updating or changing information hosted on those webpages. \nIf required on label, however, some of our members indicated that they would opt to begin to \ninclude the required information as a brand goes through a redesign or is being updated. This \nwould reduce the amount of times a label has to be touched, thus helping to reduce the cost \nassociated with updating a label, but would result in a slower roll-out than if there was more Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 25 \n \n   \n \nﬂexibility. Our members relayed that they would need to begin taking steps towards the \nimplementation of the labeling changes right away in order to become compliant before the \ncompliance period begins in ﬁve years. \n  \nWe also urge the Bureau to synchronize the implementation of any mandatory labeling changes \nso that industry members are able to comply with these new requirements in the most eﬃcient \nmanner. This would include not only the mandatory allergen labeling requirements, but also \nany ingredient labeling proposal the Bureau might be considering.  \n \nWhile we understand that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking related to ingredient \nlabeling was withdrawn earlier this year prior to its release, if the Bureau intends to revive it in \nanother form, it’s critical to note that any eventual ingredient labeling requirements being on a \ndiﬀerent implementation track would be ﬁnancially and logistically devasting for industry \nmembers large and small. It would be unreasonable to ask industry members to undergo costly \nlabel redesign to include nutrient content and allergen information and begin production on \nthose new labels across all their product lines, only to be notiﬁed they will need to restart label \nredesign to incorporate ingredient information in a couple years. We respectfully request that \nTTB consider this important point as they seek to ﬁnalize these pending rulemakings and \nprepare their future regulatory agenda.  \n \nConclusion and Summary \n \nDISCUS supports TTB’s objective to provide consumers with clear, consistent information about \nalcohol. It is critical that the ﬁnal rule serves the public\'s interests, without placing undue \nburden on distillers, overwhelming agency staﬀ, or inadvertently confusing consumers. We \nbelieve this proposal, if adopted as-is, would not meet these objectives, and we urge TTB to \nreconsider certain aspects.  \n \nWe request greater ﬂexibility in terms of how and where the Alcohol Facts information is \nprovided. Most critically, we propose the option to include it via QR codes or links. This \napproach: \n• Ensures broad consumer access (e.g., QR codes/links in advertising) and readability (e.g., \nmultiple languages for non-English speakers);  \n• Oﬀers the ability to provide consumers with up-to-date, detailed information, while \naccounts for small product/label space limitations;  \n• Reduces burden on producers, especially craft distillers, who are already facing \neconomic headwinds; \n• Allows producers to be nimble in responding to labeling changes and/or geographical \ndiﬀerences (e.g., bottle return) and, thus, minimizes waste; and \n• Aligns with labeling in other regions of the world, including the EU, which results in \ngreater consistency and can reduce potential trade barriers. \n Ms. Amy Greenberg \nAugust 15, 2025 \nPage 26 \n \n   \n \nDISCUS recommends that Alcohol Facts information specify the number of standard drinks \nper container – potentially via a graphic alongside text that states the number of servings. The \ninclusion of standard drink information better aligns with consumer understanding than the \nproposed requirement to list the amount of pure alcohol in grams, which could result in \nconsumer confusion. \n \nDISCUS has concerns regarding the signiﬁcant anticipated costs associated with this proposal, \nwhich are not commensurate with the stated beneﬁts. TTB’s own cost estimates anticipate \nimplementing this Alcohol Facts proposal will cost producers millions of dollars in label redesign, \nmarketing, logistics, and printing expenditures, at a time when the industry is constricting and \nunable to absorb these unbudgeted costs. Allowing for ﬂexibility in transmission of this \ninformation will enable broad industry compliance.   \n \nDISCUS believes TTB’s proposed serving size reference amounts for the nutrient content \nstatements will create consumer confusion, damage brand equity, and impede innovation. \nThe Ruling 2013-2 serving sizes do not appropriately ﬁt with consumer understanding around \ntraditional pours for many products and misrepresent serving sizes for many liqueurs and lower \nABV products. Allowing ﬂexibility for producers to provide their recommended serving size \nwhen a prescribed one does not neatly ﬁt is required if this proposal were to be adopted.   \n \n* * * * * \n \nAmerica’s distillers and marketers of spirits want to ensure that consumers have access to the \ninformation they need, but this proposal leaves several important issues unaddressed and \nopens distillers up to potential costs that might be insurmountable in the current market. We \nimplore TTB to carefully evaluate all potential implications of this proposal to avoid undue \nburden on distillers and TTB staﬀ, as well as any inadvertent consumer confusion. We believe \nﬂexibility and clarity will be the key to ﬁnding a balanced approach.   \n \nThank you again for providing an opportunity to discuss this important topic and we look \nforward to liaising with the Bureau on these matters going forward.

Its \npurpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint \nprojects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  \nsolutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines \nMezcal.  \n \nThe Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT \nCommittee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in \naccordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical \nregulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial \nproposal can be made. \n \nBackground \n \nOn January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a \nproposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The \nmain objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the \nalcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods \n \nKey points of the proposal: \n• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is \nproposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol \ncontent per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number \nof servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of \nalcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   \n• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different \nformats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. \n \n \n \n \n \n• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal \nRegister is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. \n \nGeneral comments on the proposal:  \n \nAlcohol content \nIt is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to \ninform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid \nounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by \nthe average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, \nand that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without \nrequiring placement in a specific panel or format. \n \nServing and servings per container: \nThe proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container \nacross all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. \nWhile it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in \na standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If \nmandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), \nwhich would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or \ncommercial burdens. \n \nNutritional information \n \nThe proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and \nproteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may \nconfuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts \nCodex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol \n \nshould not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into \nviewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions \nbased on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. \n \n \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the \nNutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? \nAlternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it \nunnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food \nlabels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the \npercentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful \ninformation for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by \nimplying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily \nnutrient requirements? \n \nWe believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any \nbenefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is \nto prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could \ncreate the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among \nconsumers. \n \nWe consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, \nsugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier \nthan other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could \nconfuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium \ncontent, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the \nconsumer\'s diet and are not comparable. \n \nBy its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental \ninformation on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that \nalcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision \nand favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of \nalcohol that each product contains. \n \nMaking this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which \ngoes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  \ntrade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this \ninformation to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible \nto consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. \nDigital labeling offers many advantages: \n• Unlimited space to inform consumers. \n• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n• Easy updating as regulations change. \n• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of \nharmful alcohol consumption. \n• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. \n \nThis approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using \ntechnology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. \nFinally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement \nthese changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in \nthe U.S. \n \n2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be \nallowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further \nbreakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \n \nAs previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels \ncould lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious \nconfusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) \nshows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is \nclear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion \nor misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. \n \n \n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such \nas trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? \n \nAs previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers \nto believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements \nlike dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not \nrecommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such \ndeclarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. \n \n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol \nbeverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  \nan erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other \nhealth-related benefits? \n \nIncluding nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly \nbelieve these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like \ndietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such \ninformation should not be required in any form.  \n \nIn Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits \nor therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus \nsolely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness \nbenefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising \nwith alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising \nRegulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. \nThese declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health \nmessaging. \n \nIn summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health \nbenefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations \non labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. \n \n \n5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in \nadvertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? \nNo comments on this topic. \n \n \n6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might \nconsumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity \nand quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts \nlabeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with \nsuch revisions? \n \nThe current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" \npanel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and \nregulatory burdens. \n \n \n7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol \nbeverage market? \n  \nMaking a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, \nimporters, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, \nthis proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO \nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be \nmore trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -\nfulfilment would create”. \n \n8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in \nparticular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? \n \nThe proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially \nsmall and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging \nand labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. \nThis burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. \n \n9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of \nalcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the \nproposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? \n \nTo reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is \nrecommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements \ninternationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. \n \n \nConclusion: \n \nDetailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health \nbenefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid \nregulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers. \n \n \nBest regards, \n \n \n \nRocio Melendrez Ramirez \nRepresentative \n \nMembers of the “Alianza para la Sustentabilidad”: Casa Xipe; Del Maguey Single Village Mezcal; Mezcal Los Danzantes; Mezcal Amarás; Mezcal El Tinieblo; \nMezcal Júrame; Marqués del Jaral de Berrio; Casa Mezcal Huitzila; Mezcal Amaxak; Promotora y Comercializadora de Destilados SA de CV; Casa Parada \nMezcal; Santa Fátima; WYN Spirits S. de R.L de C.V./Dos Hombres.

Introduction \nThe West Indies Rum & Spirits Producers’ Association (WIRSPA) represents producers \nand brand owners of Authentic Caribbean Rum and other spirits across 15 countries. Our \nmembers are long -established exporters to the United States, with many products \nbenefiting from recognition under the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative. The rum industry is \na major economic driver and an important part of the cultural heritage of the Caribbean, \nsupporting thousands of jobs in both production and tourism.   We welcome the \nopportunity to comment on TTB’s proposed rulemaking under Notice No. 237 and Notice \nNo. 238. WIRSPA supports the goal of providing consumers with accurate, clear, and \naccessible information. However, we believe that the proposed approach requires \nadjustments to ensure that it is: \n→ Meaningful for consumers  — avoiding duplication, overly technical terms, or \nmisleading nutritional framing. \n→ Flexible for producers  — recognising varied product types, serving traditions, and \ncontainer sizes. \n→ Aligned internationally — to minimise trade barriers and regulatory divergence with \nother major markets. \n→ Practical and proportionate  — limiting compliance burdens, especially for small \nproducers, and avoiding unnecessary label changes. \nKey Requests at a Glance: \n1. Change the panel title from “Alcohol Facts” to “Serving Facts”. \n2. Permit digital labeling (QR codes) to provide full information, with minimal mandatory \non-pack content. \n3. Remove “pure alcohol in fluid ounces” and keep ABV optional in the panel. \n4. Omit irrelevant nutrients. \n5. Adapt serving sizes to reflect real-world consumption; allow justified deviations. \n6. Allow flexible formatting, including linear formats without boxed borders. \n7. Maintain ±20% tolerance and avoid unnecessary COLA resubmissions. 2 \n \n8. Support 5-year transition with stock sell -through and alignment with allergen labeling \ntimelines. \n9. Confirm no allergen labeling for pre -distillation ingredients, with case -by-case post-\ndistillation checks. \n2. Title of the Statement \nThe proposed title “Alcohol Facts” risks misleading consumers into thinking that the \npanel offers a safety or health advisory, rather than factual serving information. It also \ndiffers from established voluntary practice and international norms. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 “Serving Facts” is a more neutral, accurate descriptor. \n\uf0d8 The EU and many global producers already use “Serving Facts” or similar. \n\uf0d8 A consistent title fosters consumer understanding across markets. \nConclusion / Ask: Replace “Alcohol Facts” with “Serving Facts” in all references and \nlabel examples. \n3. Digital Labeling (QR Codes and Online Access) \nThe proposed rule requires all information to appear physically on the label, which can \nbe restrictive for small containers, multilingual products, and brands selling in multiple \nmarkets. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 Codex Guidelines (CXG 105 -2024) support the use of technology to deliver food and \nbeverage information. \n\uf0d8 The EU already allows energy content on-pack with full nutrition information online . \nThe Spirits Europe and DISCUS submission s both provide extensive background to \njustify this position. \n\uf0d8 Digital labeling reduces costs, supports sustainability, and avoids frequent reprints. \n\uf0d8 QR codes can provide richer, multilingual, and updated content. \nConclusion / Ask: Allow mandatory particulars to be provided digitally via QR codes, with \nonly essential on-label data required in physical print. \n4. Content of the Statement \nSeveral proposed elements are either duplicative or not relevant to distilled spirits. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 ABV — already required elsewhere on the label; repeating it is redundant. \n\uf0d8 Fluid ounces of pure alcohol — unfamiliar to U.S. consumers and rarely used \ninternationally. \n\uf0d8 Protein and fat — always negligible in distilled spirits; inclusion implies nutritional \nbenefit. 3 \n \n\uf0d8 Avoid adopting FDA -style nutrient label format –adopting FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” \nstyle could mislead consumers into thinking alcohol has health or nutritional benefits. \nConclusion / Ask: Keep ABV optional in the panel; remove pure alcohol in fluid ounces; \nomit protein and fat unless above de minimis levels. \n5. Serving Sizes and Real-World Consumption \nThe fixed ABV -based serving size table does not reflect actual consumption for many \nspirits categories. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 Low-ABV liqueurs are often used in cocktails in portions smaller than proposed \nreference sizes. \n\uf0d8 High ABV spirits may be dispensed in smaller measures either on their own or as \ncocktail components, which is increasingly popular. \n\uf0d8 RTDs and high-ABV beers/ciders are often sold and consumed in containers larger \nthan the proposed serving size. \n\uf0d8 FDA’s RACC methodology better matches consumer expectations. \nConclusion / Ask: Greater flexibility on serving sizes – Allow sizes to reflect actual \nconsumption patterns, product type, ABV, and category norms, rather than fixed ABV -\nbased thresholds. \n6. Format and Presentation \nThe proposed boxed, prescriptive panel format is not always feasible, especially for small \nbottles or multi-market labels. Most spirits have applied label s which constrain the use \nof additional printed information. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 Linear formats without a box can be clearer and more space efficient. \n\uf0d8 Excess formatting rules can create conflicts with other jurisdictions. \nConclusion / Ask: Allow linear formats without boxed borders; permit integration with \nexisting branding. \n7. Tolerances and Compliance \nNutrient and alcohol content can vary slightly between production runs. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 ±20% tolerance is reasonable and aligns with other jurisdictions. \n\uf0d8 Exempting minor 'Serving Facts' updates from COLA resubmission reduces burdens. \nConclusion / Ask: Retain ±20% tolerance; avoid mandatory COLA resubmission for minor \nfactual updates. 4 \n \n8. Implementation Timeline and Stock Sell-Through \nLabel changes are costly and time -consuming, especially for small -volume, long-shelf-\nlife products. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 A 5-year transition is proportionate. \n\uf0d8 Stock sell-through avoids waste. \n\uf0d8 Coordinating allergen and nutrition changes reduces costs. \nConclusion / Ask: Retain 5 -year transition; allow sell -through; align implementation \ndates for Notices 237 and 238. \n9. Allergen Labeling \nThe proposed allergen labeling could unintentionally apply to ingredients used before \ndistillation. \nArgument: \n\uf0d8 Scientific consensus supports exemption for allergens removed by distillation. \n\uf0d8 Many jurisdictions already exempt such cases. \nConclusion / Ask: Confirm no allergen labeling for pre-distillation ingredients; apply case-\nby-case checks for post-distillation additions. \n \nThank you for the opportunity to make a comment on these two important issues. \n \nContact: \nVaughn Renwick, CEO WIRSPA \nvaughn.renwick@wirspa.com \n ""}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'System not allowing file to upload.

Support for Consumer Transparency and Public Health \n  \nWe support the intent of the proposed rule to provide consumers with clear, consistent, and \naccessible information regarding alcohol content, calories, and macronutrients. This aligns \nwith public health goals and empowers consumers to make informed decisions. \nHowever, we urge TTB to ensure that the implementation of these requirements does not \ndisproportionately burden small producers or create unintended barriers to market entry. \n  \n2. Concerns Regarding Cost and Burden on Small Businesses \nWhile the proposed five-year compliance period is appreciated, we remain concerned about \nthe cumulative costs of: \n• Label redesign and printing \n• Laboratory testing for nutrient content \n• Regulatory compliance and recordkeeping \n  \nWe recommend that TTB consider the following mitigations: \n• Providing a simplified compliance pathway for small producers, such as a tiered \nimplementation schedule or reduced testing requirements. \n  \n3. Flexibility in Label Format and Placement \nWe support the proposed flexibility in allowing either panel or linear formats for the Alcohol \nFacts statement. This is particularly important for smaller containers and products with limited \nlabel space. \nWe also support the removal of maximum type size restrictions and the allowance of dual-\ncolumn formats for multi-serving containers. \n  \n4. Electronic Disclosure Options \nWhile we understand TTB’s concern about accessibility, we encourage the Bureau to \nreconsider allowing QR codes or web links as a supplemental—not exclusive—means of \ndisclosure. This could reduce label clutter and allow for multilingual or dynamic content, \nespecially for export markets. This is even more relevant in 2025 where in the USA nearly 90 % \nof the population owns a smartphone. \n  \n5. Harmonization with FDA and International Standards \nWe encourage TTB to continue aligning its labeling requirements with those of the FDA and \ninternational standards where feasible. This will reduce compliance complexity for producers \noperating across regulatory jurisdictions. \n  \n6. Clarification on Alcohol Content Tolerances \nWe support the proposed tolerances for alcohol content and nutrient declarations. However, \nwe request clarification on how TTB will enforce these tolerances and whether periodic testing \nwill be required post-implementation. \n  7. Implementation Timeline and COLA Flexibility \n  \nWe support the proposed five-year implementation period and the provision that new COLA \napplications will not be required solely for the addition of Alcohol Facts statements. This will \nsignificantly reduce administrative burden. \n  \n8. Contrasting Label Background \n  \nAdditionally, please note that Red Stripe already discloses alcohol, calorie, and nutrient \ncontent on our labels in a clear and legible format, the introduction of a mandated contrasting \nbackground, without specific visual guidelines, poses practical concerns: \n• It could necessitate a complete redesign of label layouts across multiple SKUs, \npotentially impacting brand equity and incurring significant reprinting and compliance \ncosts. \n• Without a clear and standardized definition of what qualifies as “contrasting,” there is a \nrisk of inconsistent enforcement or rejection at port, which could disrupt exports. \n \nWe would therefore recommend that TTB: \n• Provide clear design guidance or acceptable examples of compliant contrasting label \nbackground formats; \n• Allow some discretion in label design to preserve brand identity while meeting \ntransparency objectives. \n  \nConclusion \nWe appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking. We believe that with \nthoughtful adjustments, the proposed Alcohol Facts labeling requirements can achieve their \nintended public health goals while minimizing undue burden on industry stakeholders. \n  \n '}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'See Attached'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0201,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-18 23:39:56,,False,Comment 198:  Red Stripe (Jamaica),09000064b8f057a3,2025-08-18 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,See Attached,meh-ife4-dpu0,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,Jamaica,,,,,,,,2025-08-18 04:00:00,1,2025-08-21 00:38:37,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,32,"[32, -1, -1]",32,-1,-1

We have over 90 member \ncompanies, from multinational spirits producers through to small family -run distillers, bottlers, \nblenders, and brand owners. Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky \nindustry by production.  \n \nAny rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the \nScotch Whisky’s biggest market by value, with exports worth £971 million in 2024. In addition, \nmany of our larger members are also investors in the United States. \n \nWe fully support TTB\'s efforts to ensure that consumers have the relevant product information to \nmake informed decisions. Our members have been doing this domestically and in their export \nmarkets, and consumers are already familiar with this practice. We w ould therefore like to \nsubmit specific comments below for your consideration on behalf of the Scotch Whisky industry. \n \nI. Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled \nSpirits, and Malt Beverages \n \nAdditional on -product labelling requirements present numerous disadvantages both to \nconsumers and businesses, particularly SMEs. Distilled spirits are one of the most highly \nregulated products in the United States, subject to rigorous pre -approval processes for labels \nand formulas. Despite this, the industry has proactively developed and implemented various \nself-regulatory initiatives to provide consumers with additional non -mandatory product \ninformation, exceeding TTB guidelines. For example, many distille rs already disclose allergen \ndetails and “Serving Facts” statements either on labels, websites, or via QR codes, \nSWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237  \n \n2 \n \ndemonstrating the industry’s leadership in enhancing product transparency. Companies using \ndigital labelling in international markets have reported clear benefits.  \n \nVoluntary information currently provided by our industry is displayed through a host of different \nmeans and formats . Specifying mandatory labelling requirements will  therefore inevitably cost \nevery spirit producer, as they will be required to incur some form of label redesign and printing \ncosts, no matter their current level of voluntary disclosure of product information.  The SWA \ntherefore recommends retaining the voluntary approach to additional product information. \nHowever, should the TTB pursue a mandato ry regime, we recommend the following \nconsiderations be taken into account. A key concern for us is to ensure that new rules are as \nflexible as possible, and do not result in unnecessary cost or burden for companies, while \nimproving information to consumers. \n \nProduct Information Statement: Serving Facts v. Alcohol Facts \n \nWe recommend that the title of the alcohol beverages information statement be “Serving Facts” \ninstead of “Alcohol Facts” as the content of the statement refers to the serving size and the \nnutritional information in a serving of a specific alcoholic beverag e. “Alcohol Facts” could \nconfuse consumers as it may suggest that the statement includes general indications on the \nconsumption of alcoholic beverages. In addition, consumers are accustomed to finding \nnutritional information in a “Serving Facts” statement because most operators who currently \nvoluntarily disclose the information use “Serving Facts” as the title. Changing the labels of \nalcoholic beverages would generate additional costs for manufacturers, importers, and \ndistributors, negatively affecting an industry that already works well in disclosing information \neffectively. \n \nDisplay of the Product Information Statement: Digital labelling benefits  \n \nWe continue to recommend that “Serving Facts” information be allowed to be provided through \ndigital labelling, particularly via digital QR codes. Spirits labels are already required to include a \ngreat deal of information in the same field of vision. Numero us studies have concluded that the \nmore health information a physical label has, the less attention the consumer pays to that \ninformation. To avoid over-crowding labels, and consequently confusing consumers, any newly \nrequired information should be allowed to be provided through a website or QR code.  \n \nWhile some consumer organisations oppose digital labelling on the grounds that it places the \nburden on consumers and puts them at a disadvantage , there are no significant studies that \nsupport this argument.  Digital labelling is not prohibitive for consumers considering that over \n90% of adult Americans own a smartphone device and 95% of adults use the internet.1 Notably, \nmobile phone ownership amongst senior citizens has been found to be as high as 94%, with 76% \nowning smartphones.2 The three largest phone carriers in the US currently each claim that their \n4G LTE network covers more than 99% of the US population, so consumers in both urban and \nrural areas should have access to the necessary coverage to access online information  in retail \nsettings. Furthermore, digital labels can assist with accessibility requirements, facilitating \nproduct information in multiple languages and allowing auditory text -to-speech access on \ndevices.  \n \n1 Pew Research – Mobile Fact Sheet.

Additionally, \nthe presence of QR codes on products correlates to increased consumer comprehension and \nconfidence about the product they are buying. It was likened to being in a traditional market, \nwhere one can speak to a vendor; a QR code allows the consu mer to find out much more than \nthey would normally be able to do in a supermarket. QR codes also reduce the chances of there \nbeing multiple labels in market for the same brand as it goes through reformulation. This assists \nwith avoiding consumer confusion when they encounter brand labels with different values side \nby side. Consumers are more trusting of digital label claims, in particular about the traceability \nof ingredients and components, manufacturing processes and environmental claims.3 \n \nToday, digital labelling has become a universally accessible, convenient, and user -friendly \nfeature, with consumers being able to access information easily through means of a smart phone \nor other electronic device. Digital labelling comes with several additional benefits: \n• Reduction of Costs for SMEs:  Digital labelling allows for quick adaptation to new legal \nrequirements without having to design and print new labels. All companies, but \nespecially SMEs, will reduce labelling costs and will have the opportunity to explore new \nexport markets around the w orld, including the US. This will benefit foreign companies, \nbut also US distillers, who will be able to use labels that are commonly used \ninternationally with only additional information to be modified online. \n• Sustainability: digital labelling is beneficial for environmental protection, as  it reduces \nwaste and costs associated with changes to traditional physical labels.  Many sectors \n(including the Scotch Whisky industry) are committed to sustainable packaging \npractices, of which labels are an essential part. The destruction of labels that are \ncommonly used in the US market and the process of printing new la bels, with the \nsignificant amount of energy involved, will have a major environmental impact. This could \nbe a recurring issue every time labelling regulations are updated. However, by using \ndigital labelling businesses can reduce waste, conserve resources, and positively impact \nthe environment. \n• Geo-specific information:  Recycling information and other sustainability -related \ninformation which are location -specific can easily be integrated into digital labels. One \nsuch example in Europe is in Italy, where mandatory recycling information for glass \nbottles can be provided in a geo-localised manner via QR-code-accessible digital labels \nsince last year.  \n \nDigital labels have been broadly implemented as a solution to provide access to product \ninformation for consumers across Europe, and we believe this could be replicated for US \nconsumers. The future of food and beverage labelling is digital. The use of this innovative \nmeasure is transformative and beneficial for the US market, where almost 97% of the population \nowns a mobile phone. Future trends predict that the number of American smartphone users \nwill increase to more than 364 million people by 2040 4. Digital labelling would be more \neffective in enabling consumers to make informed choices about their health, dietary \nrestrictions, and the environmental impact of their consumption. \n \n \n3 Digital Labelling in the EU State -of-play Report.

See: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-\nstatistics.html SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237  \n \n4 \n \nIn the undesirable situation where nutritional information could only be provided on a physical \nlabel, we kindly request to be given the option of using a linear display that is not surrounded by \na box. The space available for labelling distilled spirits is limited and a box around the claim would \nunnecessarily take up space on the label. In addition, we believe that the title “Serving Facts” in \nbold type is sufficient to allow consumers to easily locate the information on the label.  \nFurthermore, we request that TTB, at minimum, consider allowing producers to list only nutrients \npresent in the product instead of having to print the entire statement with multiple zeros.  \nWe would like to stress that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 2.3 of the WTO TBT Agreement, technical \nregulations shall not be prepared, adopted, or applied with the purpose or effect of creating \nunnecessary obstacles to international trade to fulfill the legitimate objectives of member states. \nContent of Product Information Statement \n \nDistilled spirits are not significant sources of nutritional value for consumers. Scotch Whisky, \nunder UK regulation, can only be produced in Scotland from cereals, water and yeast, with no \nflavourings or sweeteners. Because of the stringently regulated di stillation process, Scotch \nWhisky spirits do not contain carbohydrates, fat, or protein. Requiring extensive nutritional \ninformation on labels, especially when most of the nutritional facts are not applicable to distilled \nspirits, risks confusing consumers into the belief that they have a ""nutritional benefit” and that \nsome alcoholic beverages are more nutritious than others. This is especially so if the statement \ncontains additional information such as protein, vitamins and minerals, sodium, and further \nbreakdown of fats, as considered in Notice No. 237.  \nTTB asked for views on greater harmonization with the Food and Drug Administration’s  (FDA) \nnutrient content statements. We believe this would be unnecessary and misleading for the same \nreasons outlined above. No other country requires daily value information for listed nutrients on \ndistilled spirits labels, as it would deviate from common global practices . It is well -understood \nthat the consumption of spirits  provide no significant nutritional value and is not part of a \nconsumer’s daily dietary needs. Furthermore, the adoption of FDA nutrition facts levels on spirits \nwould also impose significant costs and burdens to our industry. \nThe SWA therefore recommends that any nutritional information required to be provided under \nthe “Serving Facts” be limited in scope and accessible via QR code. If the TTB adopts the \nrequirement for a “Serving Facts” statement, the SWA would also recommend the following: \n• We welcome the proposed 20% tolerance for energy and nutritional calculations.  It \nwould be beneficial for TTB to explicitly recognise that producers can continue to rely on \ndatabases and calculators to provide nutrient content information without having to \nundertake costly and burdensome laboratory testing on each of their products, \nparticularly for brand extensions that might have variation in ABV from bottle to bottle, \nsuch as cask-strength whiskies. \n• The “Serving Facts” statement should not be required to include the alcohol content \nstatement. For distilled spirits, the ABV is already required to appear in the same field of \nvision as the brand name and the class designation. Consumers are accustomed to  \nfinding this information on the main/front label. Particularly in the case of physical labels, \nspace is limited and including it to the “Serving Facts” would not add any value.  \n• We kindly request to keep the provision of the quantity of pure alcohol per serving in the \n“Serving Facts” statement optional. Providing this information without context would not \nnecessarily empower consumers to make informed choices if the concept of pur e \nalcohol is not well understood. The presence of a QR code on a label could facilitate the \nprovision of substantive information on the concepts of pure alcohol and standard SWA RESPONSE - Docket No. TTB–2025–0003; Notice No. 237  \n \n5 \n \ndrinks, as well as TTB’s Dietary Guidelines, which would not be practically feasible on a \nphysical label. \n• We would welcome more flexibility from TTB on the proposed serving sizes , which can \nvary from country to country depending on the ABV of the product. For instance, Scotch \nWhisky has a wide variety of products, some of which go beyond 40% ABV and for which \nthe serving size would differ. Furthermore, r igid one-size-fits-all serving size \nrequirements based on ABV could lead to several unintended consequences.  This \nincludes consumers incorrectly conflat ing “serving size” with recommended \nconsumption amount, the latter of which may drastically differ depending on the brand \nand ABV. This is especially so when the spirit is consumed as part of a mixed drink. Rigid \nserving sizes may undermine brand integrity and inadvertently encourage higher alcohol \nand calorie consumption. For these reasons, we recommend TTB’s proposed serving size \nguidelines remain optional, while permitting customized serving sizes where justified by \nproduct type and consumption patterns. \n• We welcome the fact that TTB will not require operators to submit new COLA applications \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion or alteration of the “Serving \nFacts” statement. This should also be extended to the case where the only change is the \ninclusion or al teration of the QR code, if it is permitted to provide the “Serving Facts” \nstatement in this manner. \n \nCompliance Period, Stock Exhaustion, Alignment with TTB Notice No. 238  \n \nIn the event the proposed rulemaking contained in Notice No. 237 is adopted, the SWA endorses \nthe proposed transition period of 5 years. Any shorter period for compliance would present \ndifficulties for our members given our sector’s current economic climate. \nFurthermore, we would like to request the possibility for our operators to exhaust all their stock \nwhich was put on the market before the proposed rule comes into effect. The stock turnover of \nour products can often be slower than for other categories of distilled spirits. \nFinally, we further recommend that its implementation is aligned with that of Notice No. 238 on \nMajor Food Allergen Labeling for Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages, along with any other \ningredient labeling proposal TTB might be considering . This would allow businesses to comply \nwith all labelling requirements within similar implementation periods.  \nIn conclusion, the Scotch Whisky industry remains firmly committed to ensuring consumers \nhave access to clear and relevant product information. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to \ncarefully assess the potential impact of any new requirements —both to a void placing undue \nburdens on businesses, particularly SMEs, and to prevent consumer confusion regarding the \nnature of our products. \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMaría José Kong  \nHead of Trade Americas  \nScotch Whisky Association \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide comments regarding Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 on Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.

Membership accounts for around 97% of the Scotch Whisky industry by production. Any rulemaking in this area is important for the SWA as the United States has long been the Scotch Whisky&rsquo;s biggest market by value, with exports worth &pound;971 million in 2024. In addition, many of our larger members are also investors in the United States.

These \nrules will be a step forward, as current alcohol labels do not provide the information that consumers need \nto make informed purchasing and consumption decisions. \n \nThe “Alcohol Facts” panel set forth by the proposed rule includes “alcohol content expressed both as a \npercentage of alcohol by volume and in fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, the number of \ncalories, and the number, in grams, of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, per serving.”\n1  \nWhile this information represents a major step forward, the rule could be strengthened by additionally \nrequiring sugars in grams, added sugars in grams, saturated fat in grams, sodium in milligrams, percent \nDaily Value for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet, number of standard drinks per container, the \nconversion between standard drinks and fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol, and the 2020-2025 Dietary \nGuidelines for Americans moderate drinking advice. The final rule should also make dual-column \nlabeling mandatory. \nThis additional information is important as part of a commonsense approach to promoting transparency, \nhealth, and safety for those who consume alcohol. Excess alcohol consumption is associated with various \nharms including motor vehicle accidents, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.2 \nAlcoholic beverages may also contribute to other forms of diet-related chronic disease as alcohol is \ncalorie-dense and on average accounts for 9% of daily calories for those who drink.3 Many alcoholic \nbeverages also contain carbohydrates, added sugars, and other nutrients to limit. Alcohol content labeling \nis a straightforward approach that increases consumer awareness of the contents of alcoholic beverages \nthrough greater transparency.4 \n \nConsumers desire this information and would use it to make decisions about alcohol consumption and \npurchasing. In a March 2024 poll of 1,509 adults who drink alcohol (commissioned by CSPI and \nconducted by Big Village), strong majorities (78-90%) said alcohol content, calorie content, and \nnutritional content, would be at least somewhat important for their alcohol purchasing decisions.\n5 \n \nWe agree with the requirement in the proposed rule that the “Alcohol Facts” disclosure appear on-\npackage and never solely via electronic means (e.g., a QR code leading to a webpage), as this would \nspecifically disadvantage populations that are less able to utilize smart phones or similar technology \n(including those who are older or living rurally). \n \nWe urge TTB to prioritize transparency and health and finalize the proposed Alcohol Facts rule to ensure \nthat Americans can make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. To ensure timely \nconsumer access to this important information, the final rule should adopt a shorter compliance period of \n3.5 years instead of the 5-year period proposed. \n \n  Sincerely, \n \nAlcohol Justice \nAmerican Society for Nutrition \nAssociation of State Public Health Nutritionists \nCeliac Disease Foundation \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest \nConsumer Federation of America \nConsumer Reports \nCURED \nFARE (Food Allergy Research & Education) \nFood Equality Initiative \nInterfaith Public Health Network \nNational Consumers League \nProject Extra Mile \nRecover Alaska \nThe FPIES Foundation \nU.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance \nWinooski Partnership for Prevention \n \nIndividuals: \n \nSarah Ermer, MPH, CHES \nPrevention Specialist \nTillamook Family Counsel \n \nThomas K.

Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including \nmany small, family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the \nnation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   W e provide the \nfollowing comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 237: Alcohol Facts \nStatements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (NPRM 237). \n \nIn general, Wine Institute supports the current “Serving Facts” framework as voluntary.  If TTB \nimposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling, we respectfully request a similar framework but \nwith several important recommendations and considerations that we outline below.   \n \n1. Wine is Unique—it is not a Recipe Product—and Wineries Vary Greatly in Size \n \nIt is important to note at the outset that wine is u nique.  Wine is not a recipe product.  Unlike \nother beverages, wine is inherently tied to its place of origin.  Every vintage is different, and \neach wine varies by year, winegrape varietal, location, climate and growing conditions.   \nBecause the winemaking process is dynamic and highly variable, decisions impacting \nnutritional content can be made right up to the time of blending and bottling.  This is significant \nbecause wine labels are most often printed many months in advance of bottling and changes \nto those labels can take up to two years to implement. \nBeyond the vineyard and winery, the wine marketplace is also distinct in terms of both the \nnumber of producers and unique wines available.   According to TTB, there are currently more \nthan 17,500 bonded wine producers across the US  and approximately 6,300 of them are in \nCalifornia.  Like our membership, the overwhelming majority of these are small, family-owned \nPage 2 of 10  \nwineries that operate in a heavily regulated industry with correspondingly high cost s in \nestablishing and maintaining their businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations \nbe fiscally responsible, reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only \nif legitimate public goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  In furtherance \nof those good rulemaking principles, TTB should consider whether it has sufficient information \nand stakeholder input to design and implement new labeling rules  at this time.  We note that \nNPRM 237 poses more than  80 questions and expressly solicits comments on over 45 topics \nthat range from general to specific.   That leaves many  of the issues subject to change  and \ncreates a challenge for stakeholders to provide sufficient information and data in the time \nprovided.  G iven that NPRM 237 constitute s a “significant regulatory action”  if adopted, it is \nimportant that the issues are fully vetted and TTB  is fully informed before deciding whether or \nhow to proceed. \n \nCost Burden Falls Unevenly on Wine \nIt is appropriate that TTB is required to design regulations, including this proposed regulation, \nin the most cost-effective , least burdensome  manner while still achieving the intended \nregulatory objective.  We applaud TTB for seeking industry input in attempting to accurately \nestimate the costs, however, we are concerned that TTB ’s cost analysis does not fully reflect \nthe likely fiscal impact on the nation’s 17,000+ wineries.  \n \nTTB’s analysis of the cost impact on wineries is based in large part on NielsenIQ data including \nan estimate of the number of universal product codes (UPCs) associated with wines in the US \nmarketplace.  We are very concerned that focusing on UPCs  may vastly undercount the \nnumber of wine labels that this proposal would require to be changed.  Many wine labels do \nnot include a UPC  because thousands of wineries rely on non-traditional sales channels \nincluding direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales and winery tasting room sales  where a UPC is not \nneeded.  DTC wine sales are a unique and important feature of the wine marketplace now that \n48 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of DTC wine sales.  Wine analytics firm, \nbw166, has done research showing that Nielsen/NIQ data represents only 54 percent of all tax \npaid volume entering the US wine market in 2024.\n1  \n \nIf TTB’s analysis does  not appropriately account for the gaps in the data it is using , then it is \nlikely that its analysis grossly underestimates the potential costs for wineries.   We are \nconcerned this analysis undercount s the thousands of wines that do not reach consumers \nthrough traditional distribution and retail channels  and thus are not accounted for in the \nNielsen data.  Between 2018 and 2024, TTB approved an average of 113,536 COLAs for wine \nper year.  In recent years, TTB has also expanded the list of items that may be revised on wine \nlabels without the need to resubmit a new COLA application.  This list now includes forty \ndifferent pieces of information that can be changed without the need for a new COLA which \nsuggests that many COLAs may be active in the marketplace for multiple years  (if not many \nyears).  As a result, bw166 estimates that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 distinct wine \nproducts for sale in the US at any given time  and which would require a newly designed label  \n \n1 https://www.bw166.com/data-science-services/  Page 3 of 10  \nas a result of this proposed regulation. 2  The sheer size and diversity of the wine marketplace \nmeans the cost of this proposal would be significant for wineries of all sizes. \n \nWe also note that as presented in NPRM 237, TTB’s cost analysis demonstrates that the cost \nburden of the proposal will fall disproportionately on wine producers.  Table 4 shows that with \na five-year compliance period, fully 49 percent  of the total cost of the proposal would fall to \nwineries, while spirits and beer producers would face half the cost  of wineries.  Yet when TTB \nestimates the number of Total Units in the marketplace in Table 1, wine constitutes only 18  \npercent of the Total Units. Wine Institute is very concerned about the impact this uneven cost \nburden will have on the t housands of small and medium sized wineries in the US.  We are \ncontinuing to review TTB’s cost analysis and seek input from our winery members on the \nanticipated costs of this proposal and will be sharing that information with TTB when available. \n \n2. Wineries Should be Allowed to Provide Serving Facts Information by Electronic \nMeans (e.g., QR Codes) \n \nIn NPRM 237, TTB explains  that it considered but is not proposing to allow the Serving Facts \npanel to be distributed by electronic means via a link, code, or other marking on the physical \nlabel.  Instead, TTB proposes requiring the full panel to appear on the physical label, but it also \nsought comments about its assumptions on this topic. \n \nEstablished Benefits of Permitting QR Codes \nPermitting the use of electronic means —such as a Quick Response ( QR) code—to present \nServing Facts would provide many be nefits to many  stakeholders including consumers, \nproducers, retailers, and regulators.  In NPRM 237, TTB recognized some of the benefits.  They \nincluded cost -efficiency, flexibility, reduction in time -to-market, and the ability to present \nrelevant information in a more consumer -friendly format that is away from overcrowded \nphysical labels.  There are other benefits, however, including: \n \n• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer  in real time, which is \nnot possible using physical labels.   This is already used to comply with the E uropean \nUnion’s (EU) labeling requirements for wine—which permits mandatory nutrition and \ningredient information via QR code—given the EU’s 24 official languages. \n• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired.\n3 \n• Reduced waste, consistent with industry sustainability goals, since the use of e-labels \nreduces label re-prints. \n \n \n \n2 https://www.bw166.com/2025/07/28/tariffs-pricing-and-volume/  \n3 See, e.g., Blind Welfare Society, available at  https://blindwelfaresociety.in/blogs/innovative-food-packaging-solutions-\nmaking-food-more-accessible-for-the-visually-impaired (“QR codes can link to audio descriptions when scanned with \na smartphone.  This feature can provide detailed information about the product, including ingredients, cooking \ninstructions, and dietary information.”) ; see also, BBC News, The codes helping visually -impaired people shop, \navailable at https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57679943. Page 4 of 10  \nQR Codes in the Marketplace \nElectronic means such as QR codes are already common in the marketplace.   For instance , \nin NPRM 237, TTB cited broad implementation of digital labels  for wine  in the EU and the \nbenefits electronic information disclosure could have for international trade.   We agree that \npermitting Serving Facts information by electronic means in the US will help harmonize \napproaches, minimize negative trade impacts, and facilitate US wine exports.  \n \nThe EU is not the only place where mandatory disclosures are permitted exclusively via \nelectronic means.   For example, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) permits products \nthat are subject to the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard to provide the \nmandatory bioengineered symbol via QR code rather than on the physical label.\n4  Likewise, in \n2023 amendments to the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act , \nthe Legislature made clear that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recover y “may \nrequire that a beverage container intended for sale in the state be … marked with a scan code, \na quick response (QR) code, or a universal product code or similar machine-readable indicia” \nwhen providing the mandatory California Redemption Value or “CRV” mark rather than \nprinting or embossing it on the container.5 \n  \nNotably, GS1—the international global standards organization for developing and maintaining \nbarcodes—is working toward what it calls Sunrise 2027.  That is the year by which the global \nsupply chain (manufacturers and retailers ) will move toward “two-dimensional barcodes ” \n(e.g., QR codes) .  According to GS1, b y the end of 2027, retailers w ill need to ensure their \npoint-of-sale systems are equipped with scanners capable of reading both traditional \nbarcodes and 2D barcodes.  The shift has already begun with the new technology being tested \nin 48 countries across the world.  In short, QR codes will become more ubiquitous, common \nand familiar to consumers, and accessible as manufacturers and retailers make this shift in \nthe coming years. \n \nQR Code Accessibility \nAs a related point, it is critical for TTB to consider the direction and pace at which technologies \nare trending along with consumer access, familiarity, and preferences.  For example, in NPRM \n237, TTB references a 2023 survey that the Pew Research Center conducted .  TTB notes the \nsurvey found that “79 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned \nsmartphones compared to 90-98 percent of higher income groups.”  The same survey data for \n2024, however,  shows that 84 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 \nreported owning smartphones.\n6  That is a five percent increase over just one year.  Pew’s 2024 \nsurvey data also shows that nine out of ten (91 percent) Americans now own a smartphone. \n \nOther information at the inter section of technology, consumer products, and public policy  \ndemonstrates that  QR codes and other electronic means  of conveying information are \n \n4 See 7 CFR 66.100(b)(3). \n5 See California Public Resources Code section 14561(d). \n6 See Pew Research Center, Mobile Fact Sheet, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/ internet/fact-sheet/\nmobile. Page 5 of 10  \nincreasingly feasible, accept ed, and effective .  The Information Technology and Innovation \nFoundation issued a report in 2022 in which it found that (1) US mobile coverage is \n“ubiquitous,” (2) 4G covers “almost 100 percent of the population,” and (3) “improved fixed \nwireless and low-earth orbit satellites are emerging to fill the remaining gaps” over the coming \nyears.7  According to GS1, recent survey data showed that 79 percent of consumers are more \nlikely to purchase products with a scannable barcode/QR code (via smartphone) that provides \nthe additional product information that they would want to see.8  That number will likely grow \nas QR codes become more common. \n \nWine Labels Already Contain Other Mandatory Information on Limited Space \nDue to bottle sizes , wine labels are often mere inches  tall and wide .  Some label suppliers \nidentify 3.5 x 4 inches as  the “common” or “traditional” size for the front label on a standard \n750 milliliter wine bottle.  Back labels are often  smaller.  In sum, there is limited space  to \nprovide information.  That is important to note because physical labels are already subject to \nvarious federal and state laws that strictly prescribe what wine label s must include, may \ninclude, and may not include.  Below are non-exhaustive lists with some examples: \n \n• Wine label s must include: a government health warning; brand name; producer, \nbottler, or (if applicable) importer name and address; class or type designation; \nalcohol content statement; sulfite declaration (if present at 10 or more parts per \nmillion); net contents; color ingredient disclosures (if applicable);  an appellation of \norigin in certain circumstances; and, as a practical reality, a barcode.\n9   \n• Wine labels may include: a vintage date, winegrape variety, the term “estate bottled,” \nappellation of origin or approved American Viticultural Area, certification claims (if \napplicable), and other descriptive information that consumers desire including tasting \nand sensory notes, food pairing suggestions, recognizable trademarks, or information \nabout the winery, winemaker, and winemaking process.\n10 \n• Wine labels may not include:  any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or \nthat, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the \naddition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading \nimpression; that is  disparaging of a competitor's products; or any statement, design, \ndevice, or representation which is obscene or indecent; and more.\n11 \n \nIn addition, labeling laws often dictate not only the  substance of what must or may be \nincluded on a label, but other details like the specific placement, font type, and font size used \non labels.  Finally, wines set for export must comply with labeling regimes in the destination \nmarket.  As noted, this means US wines exported to the EU may use a QR code on the physical \nlabel to provide mandatory nutrition and ingredient information,  and—given there are 24 \n \n7 See Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, The State of US Broadband in 2022: Reassessing the \nWhole Picture, https://itif.org/publications/2022/12/05/state-of-us-broadband-in-2022-reassessing-the-whole picture/. \n8 See id.; see also https://www.gs1us.org/content/dam/gs1us/documents/who-we-are/about-us/How-Product-\nData-Influences-Shoppers.pdf.  \n9 See, generally, Wine Labeling: Checklist of Mandatory Labeling Information.  \n10 See, generally, Optional Wine Label Information. \n11 See, generally, 27 CFR 4.39. Page 6 of 10  \nofficial languages across the EU—many US wineries use this solution that EU lawmakers \nprovided. \n \nIn sum, if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should permit the use of QR \ncodes or other electronic means to disclose that information as an alternative to printing it on \nlabels. \n \n3. The Title of the Proposed Panel Should Remain as “Serving Facts” \n \nThe current voluntary rules for disclosing nutritional information use the title “Serving Facts”  \nand have since those rules initially issued in 2013.  In NPRM 237, TTB proposes now using the \ntitle “Alcohol Facts” but also seeks input on whether it should continue using “Serving Facts” \ninstead. \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should continue using the title “Serving \nFacts” for several reasons.  The most obvious reason is consistency.   Again, since 2013, TTB \nhas permitted the optional disclosure of the same nutritional information proposed in NPRM \n237 but under title “Serving Facts.”  That title is what consumers, producers, and retailers \nhave come to know not only on labels but also websites and product fact sheets.  Changing \nthat title after years of continued use will lik ely cause confusion.  Moreo ver, it is misleading \nand confusing to use the title “Alcohol Facts” when most of the information in the proposed \npanel has nothing to do with alcohol.  Instead, it presents information about serving size, \nservings per container, and respective amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein \nper serving.  Finally, “Serving Facts” is sufficiently distinct from FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” title \nand thus avoids any confusion with beverages that do not contain alcohol.  The title sho uld \nremain as “Serving Facts.” \n \n4.  An Implementation Period of Five Years is Reasonable and Necessary \n \nTTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal \nRegister.  If TTB  imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling , we strongly agree with the  \nproposed five-year compliance period and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing  it.  Five \nyears would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new labeling \nprocesses which will help minimize —but not eliminate—financial and operation burdens.  It \nwould allow ample time for public and stakeholder education  and regulatory guidance .  It \nwould also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, and \nadvertising materials and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in NPRM 237, five years is \nwithin the t ypical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according t o an  FDA \nregulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.\n12 \n \n12 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Regulatory Impact Analysis for Final Rules On: “Food Labeling: Revision of \nthe Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels” and “Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be \nConsumed at One Eating Occasion; Dual -Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain \nReference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments,” 2016, \navailable at https://www.fda.gov/media/98712/download. Page 7 of 10  \n \n5. Proposed Serving Size and Servings Per Container Should be Maintained \n \nTTB proposes including a serving size of 2.5 fluid ounces for wines with above 16 to 24 percent \nAlcohol by Volume (ABV) and 5 fluid ounces for wines with 7 to 16 percent ABV.   TTB also \nproposes including the number of servings per container.  We consider the proposed serving \nsizes and a servings per container disclosure to be reasonable,  familiar to consumers , and \nconsistent with what is used under the current voluntary rules and therefore appropriate to \nuse if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts. \n \n6.  A Single Alcohol Content Statement Expressed as ABV is Appropriate \n \nTTB proposes including an alcohol content statement—expressed as ABV per serving—for all \nwines including for those with 7 to 16 percent ABV and, underneath, a statement of alcohol \ncontent in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts , it should require only one alcohol \ncontent statement expressed as ABV and not  require a statement in fluid ounces of pure \nalcohol per serving.  For many decades, ABV has been the near universal means for disclosing \nalcohol content for wines.  This is true in  the US and many parts of the world.  As a result, \nconsumers are already familiar with and understand how to interpret ABV levels in wines.   \n \nThis consumer acceptance of ABV labeling is reflected not only in the US’s current labeling \nregulations but also in multiple trade agreements to which the US is a party.   The World Wine \nTrade Group Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling specifies that all parties must \naccept alcohol content labeling by volume (ABV).\n13  Additionally, the US -Mexico-Canada \nAgreement (USMCA) includes a similar provision in Annex 3-C which also requires the parties \nto permit alcohol content labeling by volume. 14  In neither case do these agreements require \nor permit alcohol content labeling by other measures such as fluid ounces.  Likewise, the \nInternational Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), in its International Standard for the Labeling \nof Wines, also includes alcohol strength expressed as a percentage of volume (ABV) as an \nitem of compulsory information.\n15 \n \nABV is what consumers know and understand.  A lcohol content expressed as ABV has long \nsince been required for wines above 16 percent ABV and voluntarily used for most wines that \nare 7 to 16 percent ABV.  It is also used on spirits and malt beverages.   Thus, if  TTB adopts \nmandatory provision of ABV within the Serving Facts panel , that single disclosure should \nsuffice and it should not also be required elsewhere on the label.   Wine Institute urges that  \nTTB not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   Unlike ABV, \nconsumers are  unfamiliar with alcohol statements  in the form of fluid ounces and thus it  \n \n13 https://www.wwtg.gov/assets/uploads/labelling-agreement.pdf. \n14 https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/FTA/USMCA/Text/03_Agriculture.pdf . \n15https://www.oiv.int/sites/default/files/publication/202503/OIV%20Wine%20Labelling%20Standard%20EN_20\n25%20complet.pdf. Page 8 of 10  \nwould cause confusion.  The fact that it would be presented in addition to ABV, would only \ncompound the likelihood for confusion.  The ABV statement provides all that an interested \nconsumer needs to determine how much alcohol they are consuming and in a familiar and \ncommon form.  \n  \nLikewise, ABV information will provide uniform labeling of alcohol content that will assist \ntaxpayers in complying with their obligations under the Internal Revenue Code and will assist \nTTB in identifying alcohol beverage products that pose compliance risks .  Those are reasons \nTTB cites for proposing alcohol content labeling.  Also requiring a statement in fluid ounces of \npure alcohol per serving  will have no added benefit .  Instead, it will potentially cause \nconfusion and burden businesses. \nAs a final point, requiring a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving  could invite \nmisleading and deceptive claims since it presents a number that appears lower than ABV and \nin a form that is unfamiliar to consumers (e.g., “Just 0.7 fluid ounces of alcohol!”).  TTB should \navoid that problem by requiring only one alcohol content statement expressed as ABV .  It \nshould not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. \n \n7.  TTB Should Consider Several Points Regarding Calories, Carbohydrate, Fat, \nProtein, and Sugar \n \nTTB proposes mandatory disclosure of calories  per serving, and carbohydrates, fat, and \nprotein in grams per serving.  For sugar, the Serving Facts panel may express the number of \ntotal sugars in grams per serving.   \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, requiring the amounts of calories, \ncarbohydrates, fat, and protein in the Serving Facts panel does not present serious concerns \nfor our members aside from those raised elsewhere in our comments (e.g., permitting \nprovision via electronic means  like a QR code ).  That said, there are at least three important \npoints that TTB should consider: \n• For carbohydrates, Wine Institute has  repeatedly expressed concern s about \ninaccuracies of the “by difference” method that TTB and FDA use for calculating \ncarbohydrates in wine.  The “by difference” method as described by Merrill and Watt in \nthe USDA publication, Energy Value of Foods: Basis and Derivation. Agriculture \nHandbook No. 74 (Merrill & Watt, 1973) is not accurate for wine.  TTB should work with \nFDA to permit the use of the more  accurate “quantitation and summation of sugars” \napproach as an approved method for calculating total carbohydrate content in wine \nand wine-based beverages. \n• In general, fat and protein amounts in wine will almost always be zero. \n• In general, California law prohibits the addition of sugar to wine.\n16 \nTTB should consider those points and perhaps seek further stakeholder input before imposing \nmandatory provision of Serving Facts. \n \n16 See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, § 17010. Page 9 of 10  \n \n8. The Proposed Rules for Tolerances, Typical Values, and Format and Placements \nOptions Should be Maintained \nTTB proposes an objective standard,  which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or \nbelow the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.  TTB believes these \nproposed tolerances would facilitate the use of “typical values” charts and other \nmethodologies to calculate the level of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in alcohol \nbeverage products.   \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with the proposed “objective \nstandard” tolerance of 20 percent and the continued ability to use “typical values” to calculate \ncalories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  Doing so will help allev iate some of the cost, \noperational, and other burdens—including the need for repeated and expensive testing—while \nstill providing adequate information.  We note, however, that most wines have very little or no \nfat or protein.  Consequently, if a winery nee ds to declare a non-zero level (e.g. less than 0.5 \ngrams per serving for fat and/or protein), a 20 percent tolerance level may be insufficient and \nindeed may be below the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the analytical \nmethod used.  We recommend that for low levels (e.g. less than one gram per serving) that an \nabsolute level be used as the specified tolerance rather than a percent  of the declared value.  \nThis concept is already used in other markets.  As an example, in the EU for declared le vels of \ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat in food that are under 10  grams/100 grams in concentration, \nthe allowed tolerances are expressed in absolute terms (i.e., +/- 2 grams for carbohydrates and \nprotein, and +/- 1.5 grams for fat).\n17 \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with its proposal to permit much \nneeded flexibility in terms of format (e.g., panel or linear) and placement  (e.g., horizontal or \nvertical).  Likewise, we agree with TTB’s  proposal that if Serving Facts becomes  mandatory, it \nwill not require industry members to submit new C ertificate of Label Approval applications \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion, or alteration, of a required Serving \nFacts panel or statement containing alcohol content information.  These important and flexible \nelements will help alleviate some of the cost and operational burdens on wineries and provide \nflexibility to decide what works best for their products.   We reiterate, however, that the best \nsolution is to permit the provision of mandatory information via electronic means (QR codes) \nfor the many reasons stated above. \n*** \n \n \n \n17 See Table 1, Guidance Document for Competent Authorities for the Control of Compliance with EU Legislation on \nRegulation EU 1169/2011, December 2012, available at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-10/labelling_ \nnutrition -vitamins_minerals-guidance_tolerances_1212_en.pdf.

Our membership consists of wineries of all sizes including \nmany small, family-owned wineries.  California is responsible for more than 81 percent of the \nnation’s wine production and more than 95 percent of US wine exports.   W e provide the \nfollowing comments in response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 237: Alcohol Facts \nStatements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages (NPRM 237). \n \nIn general, Wine Institute supports the current “Serving Facts” framework as voluntary.  If TTB \nimposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling, we respectfully request a similar framework but \nwith several important recommendations and considerations that we outline below.   \n \n1. Wine is Unique—it is not a Recipe Product—and Wineries Vary Greatly in Size \n \nIt is important to note at the outset that wine is u nique.  Wine is not a recipe product.  Unlike \nother beverages, wine is inherently tied to its place of origin.  Every vintage is different, and \neach wine varies by year, winegrape varietal, location, climate and growing conditions.   \nBecause the winemaking process is dynamic and highly variable, decisions impacting \nnutritional content can be made right up to the time of blending and bottling.  This is significant \nbecause wine labels are most often printed many months in advance of bottling and changes \nto those labels can take up to two years to implement. \nBeyond the vineyard and winery, the wine marketplace is also distinct in terms of both the \nnumber of producers and unique wines available.   According to TTB, there are currently more \nthan 17,500 bonded wine producers across the US  and approximately 6,300 of them are in \nCalifornia.  Like our membership, the overwhelming majority of these are small, family-owned \nPage 2 of 10  \nwineries that operate in a heavily regulated industry with correspondingly high cost s in \nestablishing and maintaining their businesses.  Therefore, it is critical that any new regulations \nbe fiscally responsible, reasonable, minimally intrusive to winery operations, and adopted only \nif legitimate public goals and established benefits to consumers justify them.  In furtherance \nof those good rulemaking principles, TTB should consider whether it has sufficient information \nand stakeholder input to design and implement new labeling rules  at this time.  We note that \nNPRM 237 poses more than  80 questions and expressly solicits comments on over 45 topics \nthat range from general to specific.   That leaves many  of the issues subject to change  and \ncreates a challenge for stakeholders to provide sufficient information and data in the time \nprovided.  G iven that NPRM 237 constitute s a “significant regulatory action”  if adopted, it is \nimportant that the issues are fully vetted and TTB  is fully informed before deciding whether or \nhow to proceed. \n \nCost Burden Falls Unevenly on Wine \nIt is appropriate that TTB is required to design regulations, including this proposed regulation, \nin the most cost-effective , least burdensome  manner while still achieving the intended \nregulatory objective.  We applaud TTB for seeking industry input in attempting to accurately \nestimate the costs, however, we are concerned that TTB ’s cost analysis does not fully reflect \nthe likely fiscal impact on the nation’s 17,000+ wineries.  \n \nTTB’s analysis of the cost impact on wineries is based in large part on NielsenIQ data including \nan estimate of the number of universal product codes (UPCs) associated with wines in the US \nmarketplace.  We are very concerned that focusing on UPCs  may vastly undercount the \nnumber of wine labels that this proposal would require to be changed.  Many wine labels do \nnot include a UPC  because thousands of wineries rely on non-traditional sales channels \nincluding direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales and winery tasting room sales  where a UPC is not \nneeded.  DTC wine sales are a unique and important feature of the wine marketplace now that \n48 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of DTC wine sales.  Wine analytics firm, \nbw166, has done research showing that Nielsen/NIQ data represents only 54 percent of all tax \npaid volume entering the US wine market in 2024.\n1  \n \nIf TTB’s analysis does  not appropriately account for the gaps in the data it is using , then it is \nlikely that its analysis grossly underestimates the potential costs for wineries.   We are \nconcerned this analysis undercount s the thousands of wines that do not reach consumers \nthrough traditional distribution and retail channels  and thus are not accounted for in the \nNielsen data.  Between 2018 and 2024, TTB approved an average of 113,536 COLAs for wine \nper year.  In recent years, TTB has also expanded the list of items that may be revised on wine \nlabels without the need to resubmit a new COLA application.  This list now includes forty \ndifferent pieces of information that can be changed without the need for a new COLA which \nsuggests that many COLAs may be active in the marketplace for multiple years  (if not many \nyears).  As a result, bw166 estimates that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 distinct wine \nproducts for sale in the US at any given time  and which would require a newly designed label  \n \n1 https://www.bw166.com/data-science-services/  Page 3 of 10  \nas a result of this proposed regulation. 2  The sheer size and diversity of the wine marketplace \nmeans the cost of this proposal would be significant for wineries of all sizes. \n \nWe also note that as presented in NPRM 237, TTB’s cost analysis demonstrates that the cost \nburden of the proposal will fall disproportionately on wine producers.  Table 4 shows that with \na five-year compliance period, fully 49 percent  of the total cost of the proposal would fall to \nwineries, while spirits and beer producers would face half the cost  of wineries.  Yet when TTB \nestimates the number of Total Units in the marketplace in Table 1, wine constitutes only 18  \npercent of the Total Units. Wine Institute is very concerned about the impact this uneven cost \nburden will have on the t housands of small and medium sized wineries in the US.  We are \ncontinuing to review TTB’s cost analysis and seek input from our winery members on the \nanticipated costs of this proposal and will be sharing that information with TTB when available. \n \n2. Wineries Should be Allowed to Provide Serving Facts Information by Electronic \nMeans (e.g., QR Codes) \n \nIn NPRM 237, TTB explains  that it considered but is not proposing to allow the Serving Facts \npanel to be distributed by electronic means via a link, code, or other marking on the physical \nlabel.  Instead, TTB proposes requiring the full panel to appear on the physical label, but it also \nsought comments about its assumptions on this topic. \n \nEstablished Benefits of Permitting QR Codes \nPermitting the use of electronic means —such as a Quick Response ( QR) code—to present \nServing Facts would provide many be nefits to many  stakeholders including consumers, \nproducers, retailers, and regulators.  In NPRM 237, TTB recognized some of the benefits.  They \nincluded cost -efficiency, flexibility, reduction in time -to-market, and the ability to present \nrelevant information in a more consumer -friendly format that is away from overcrowded \nphysical labels.  There are other benefits, however, including: \n \n• Translation of e-label content into the language of the consumer  in real time, which is \nnot possible using physical labels.   This is already used to comply with the E uropean \nUnion’s (EU) labeling requirements for wine—which permits mandatory nutrition and \ningredient information via QR code—given the EU’s 24 official languages. \n• Enhanced accessibility via new audio technologies for the visually impaired.\n3 \n• Reduced waste, consistent with industry sustainability goals, since the use of e-labels \nreduces label re-prints. \n \n \n \n2 https://www.bw166.com/2025/07/28/tariffs-pricing-and-volume/  \n3 See, e.g., Blind Welfare Society, available at  https://blindwelfaresociety.in/blogs/innovative-food-packaging-solutions-\nmaking-food-more-accessible-for-the-visually-impaired (“QR codes can link to audio descriptions when scanned with \na smartphone.  This feature can provide detailed information about the product, including ingredients, cooking \ninstructions, and dietary information.”) ; see also, BBC News, The codes helping visually -impaired people shop, \navailable at https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57679943. Page 4 of 10  \nQR Codes in the Marketplace \nElectronic means such as QR codes are already common in the marketplace.   For instance , \nin NPRM 237, TTB cited broad implementation of digital labels  for wine  in the EU and the \nbenefits electronic information disclosure could have for international trade.   We agree that \npermitting Serving Facts information by electronic means in the US will help harmonize \napproaches, minimize negative trade impacts, and facilitate US wine exports.  \n \nThe EU is not the only place where mandatory disclosures are permitted exclusively via \nelectronic means.   For example, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) permits products \nthat are subject to the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard to provide the \nmandatory bioengineered symbol via QR code rather than on the physical label.\n4  Likewise, in \n2023 amendments to the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act , \nthe Legislature made clear that the Department of Resources Recycling and Recover y “may \nrequire that a beverage container intended for sale in the state be … marked with a scan code, \na quick response (QR) code, or a universal product code or similar machine-readable indicia” \nwhen providing the mandatory California Redemption Value or “CRV” mark rather than \nprinting or embossing it on the container.5 \n  \nNotably, GS1—the international global standards organization for developing and maintaining \nbarcodes—is working toward what it calls Sunrise 2027.  That is the year by which the global \nsupply chain (manufacturers and retailers ) will move toward “two-dimensional barcodes ” \n(e.g., QR codes) .  According to GS1, b y the end of 2027, retailers w ill need to ensure their \npoint-of-sale systems are equipped with scanners capable of reading both traditional \nbarcodes and 2D barcodes.  The shift has already begun with the new technology being tested \nin 48 countries across the world.  In short, QR codes will become more ubiquitous, common \nand familiar to consumers, and accessible as manufacturers and retailers make this shift in \nthe coming years. \n \nQR Code Accessibility \nAs a related point, it is critical for TTB to consider the direction and pace at which technologies \nare trending along with consumer access, familiarity, and preferences.  For example, in NPRM \n237, TTB references a 2023 survey that the Pew Research Center conducted .  TTB notes the \nsurvey found that “79 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 owned \nsmartphones compared to 90-98 percent of higher income groups.”  The same survey data for \n2024, however,  shows that 84 percent of adults with annual incomes less than $30,000 \nreported owning smartphones.\n6  That is a five percent increase over just one year.  Pew’s 2024 \nsurvey data also shows that nine out of ten (91 percent) Americans now own a smartphone. \n \nOther information at the inter section of technology, consumer products, and public policy  \ndemonstrates that  QR codes and other electronic means  of conveying information are \n \n4 See 7 CFR 66.100(b)(3). \n5 See California Public Resources Code section 14561(d). \n6 See Pew Research Center, Mobile Fact Sheet, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/ internet/fact-sheet/\nmobile. Page 5 of 10  \nincreasingly feasible, accept ed, and effective .  The Information Technology and Innovation \nFoundation issued a report in 2022 in which it found that (1) US mobile coverage is \n“ubiquitous,” (2) 4G covers “almost 100 percent of the population,” and (3) “improved fixed \nwireless and low-earth orbit satellites are emerging to fill the remaining gaps” over the coming \nyears.7  According to GS1, recent survey data showed that 79 percent of consumers are more \nlikely to purchase products with a scannable barcode/QR code (via smartphone) that provides \nthe additional product information that they would want to see.8  That number will likely grow \nas QR codes become more common. \n \nWine Labels Already Contain Other Mandatory Information on Limited Space \nDue to bottle sizes , wine labels are often mere inches  tall and wide .  Some label suppliers \nidentify 3.5 x 4 inches as  the “common” or “traditional” size for the front label on a standard \n750 milliliter wine bottle.  Back labels are often  smaller.  In sum, there is limited space  to \nprovide information.  That is important to note because physical labels are already subject to \nvarious federal and state laws that strictly prescribe what wine label s must include, may \ninclude, and may not include.  Below are non-exhaustive lists with some examples: \n \n• Wine label s must include: a government health warning; brand name; producer, \nbottler, or (if applicable) importer name and address; class or type designation; \nalcohol content statement; sulfite declaration (if present at 10 or more parts per \nmillion); net contents; color ingredient disclosures (if applicable);  an appellation of \norigin in certain circumstances; and, as a practical reality, a barcode.\n9   \n• Wine labels may include: a vintage date, winegrape variety, the term “estate bottled,” \nappellation of origin or approved American Viticultural Area, certification claims (if \napplicable), and other descriptive information that consumers desire including tasting \nand sensory notes, food pairing suggestions, recognizable trademarks, or information \nabout the winery, winemaker, and winemaking process.\n10 \n• Wine labels may not include:  any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or \nthat, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the \naddition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading \nimpression; that is  disparaging of a competitor's products; or any statement, design, \ndevice, or representation which is obscene or indecent; and more.\n11 \n \nIn addition, labeling laws often dictate not only the  substance of what must or may be \nincluded on a label, but other details like the specific placement, font type, and font size used \non labels.  Finally, wines set for export must comply with labeling regimes in the destination \nmarket.  As noted, this means US wines exported to the EU may use a QR code on the physical \nlabel to provide mandatory nutrition and ingredient information,  and—given there are 24 \n \n7 See Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, The State of US Broadband in 2022: Reassessing the \nWhole Picture, https://itif.org/publications/2022/12/05/state-of-us-broadband-in-2022-reassessing-the-whole picture/. \n8 See id.; see also https://www.gs1us.org/content/dam/gs1us/documents/who-we-are/about-us/How-Product-\nData-Influences-Shoppers.pdf.  \n9 See, generally, Wine Labeling: Checklist of Mandatory Labeling Information.  \n10 See, generally, Optional Wine Label Information. \n11 See, generally, 27 CFR 4.39. Page 6 of 10  \nofficial languages across the EU—many US wineries use this solution that EU lawmakers \nprovided. \n \nIn sum, if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should permit the use of QR \ncodes or other electronic means to disclose that information as an alternative to printing it on \nlabels. \n \n3. The Title of the Proposed Panel Should Remain as “Serving Facts” \n \nThe current voluntary rules for disclosing nutritional information use the title “Serving Facts”  \nand have since those rules initially issued in 2013.  In NPRM 237, TTB proposes now using the \ntitle “Alcohol Facts” but also seeks input on whether it should continue using “Serving Facts” \ninstead. \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, it should continue using the title “Serving \nFacts” for several reasons.  The most obvious reason is consistency.   Again, since 2013, TTB \nhas permitted the optional disclosure of the same nutritional information proposed in NPRM \n237 but under title “Serving Facts.”  That title is what consumers, producers, and retailers \nhave come to know not only on labels but also websites and product fact sheets.  Changing \nthat title after years of continued use will lik ely cause confusion.  Moreo ver, it is misleading \nand confusing to use the title “Alcohol Facts” when most of the information in the proposed \npanel has nothing to do with alcohol.  Instead, it presents information about serving size, \nservings per container, and respective amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein \nper serving.  Finally, “Serving Facts” is sufficiently distinct from FDA’s “Nutrition Facts” title \nand thus avoids any confusion with beverages that do not contain alcohol.  The title sho uld \nremain as “Serving Facts.” \n \n4.  An Implementation Period of Five Years is Reasonable and Necessary \n \nTTB proposes a compliance date of five years from when a final rule is published in the Federal \nRegister.  If TTB  imposes mandatory Serving Facts labeling , we strongly agree with the  \nproposed five-year compliance period and with TTB’s sound reasons for proposing  it.  Five \nyears would allow businesses to exhaust existing label stocks and prepare for new labeling \nprocesses which will help minimize —but not eliminate—financial and operation burdens.  It \nwould allow ample time for public and stakeholder education  and regulatory guidance .  It \nwould also allow time to align other resources like product fact sheets, websites, and \nadvertising materials and ensure compliance.  Finally, as TTB noted in NPRM 237, five years is \nwithin the t ypical cycle for food and beverage products to relabel according t o an  FDA \nregulatory impact analysis for a food labeling rule.\n12 \n \n12 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Regulatory Impact Analysis for Final Rules On: “Food Labeling: Revision of \nthe Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels” and “Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be \nConsumed at One Eating Occasion; Dual -Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain \nReference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments,” 2016, \navailable at https://www.fda.gov/media/98712/download. Page 7 of 10  \n \n5. Proposed Serving Size and Servings Per Container Should be Maintained \n \nTTB proposes including a serving size of 2.5 fluid ounces for wines with above 16 to 24 percent \nAlcohol by Volume (ABV) and 5 fluid ounces for wines with 7 to 16 percent ABV.   TTB also \nproposes including the number of servings per container.  We consider the proposed serving \nsizes and a servings per container disclosure to be reasonable,  familiar to consumers , and \nconsistent with what is used under the current voluntary rules and therefore appropriate to \nuse if TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts. \n \n6.  A Single Alcohol Content Statement Expressed as ABV is Appropriate \n \nTTB proposes including an alcohol content statement—expressed as ABV per serving—for all \nwines including for those with 7 to 16 percent ABV and, underneath, a statement of alcohol \ncontent in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts , it should require only one alcohol \ncontent statement expressed as ABV and not  require a statement in fluid ounces of pure \nalcohol per serving.  For many decades, ABV has been the near universal means for disclosing \nalcohol content for wines.  This is true in  the US and many parts of the world.  As a result, \nconsumers are already familiar with and understand how to interpret ABV levels in wines.   \n \nThis consumer acceptance of ABV labeling is reflected not only in the US’s current labeling \nregulations but also in multiple trade agreements to which the US is a party.   The World Wine \nTrade Group Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labeling specifies that all parties must \naccept alcohol content labeling by volume (ABV).\n13  Additionally, the US -Mexico-Canada \nAgreement (USMCA) includes a similar provision in Annex 3-C which also requires the parties \nto permit alcohol content labeling by volume. 14  In neither case do these agreements require \nor permit alcohol content labeling by other measures such as fluid ounces.  Likewise, the \nInternational Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), in its International Standard for the Labeling \nof Wines, also includes alcohol strength expressed as a percentage of volume (ABV) as an \nitem of compulsory information.\n15 \n \nABV is what consumers know and understand.  A lcohol content expressed as ABV has long \nsince been required for wines above 16 percent ABV and voluntarily used for most wines that \nare 7 to 16 percent ABV.  It is also used on spirits and malt beverages.   Thus, if  TTB adopts \nmandatory provision of ABV within the Serving Facts panel , that single disclosure should \nsuffice and it should not also be required elsewhere on the label.   Wine Institute urges that  \nTTB not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving.   Unlike ABV, \nconsumers are  unfamiliar with alcohol statements  in the form of fluid ounces and thus it  \n \n13 https://www.wwtg.gov/assets/uploads/labelling-agreement.pdf. \n14 https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/FTA/USMCA/Text/03_Agriculture.pdf . \n15https://www.oiv.int/sites/default/files/publication/202503/OIV%20Wine%20Labelling%20Standard%20EN_20\n25%20complet.pdf. Page 8 of 10  \nwould cause confusion.  The fact that it would be presented in addition to ABV, would only \ncompound the likelihood for confusion.  The ABV statement provides all that an interested \nconsumer needs to determine how much alcohol they are consuming and in a familiar and \ncommon form.  \n  \nLikewise, ABV information will provide uniform labeling of alcohol content that will assist \ntaxpayers in complying with their obligations under the Internal Revenue Code and will assist \nTTB in identifying alcohol beverage products that pose compliance risks .  Those are reasons \nTTB cites for proposing alcohol content labeling.  Also requiring a statement in fluid ounces of \npure alcohol per serving  will have no added benefit .  Instead, it will potentially cause \nconfusion and burden businesses. \nAs a final point, requiring a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving  could invite \nmisleading and deceptive claims since it presents a number that appears lower than ABV and \nin a form that is unfamiliar to consumers (e.g., “Just 0.7 fluid ounces of alcohol!”).  TTB should \navoid that problem by requiring only one alcohol content statement expressed as ABV .  It \nshould not require a statement in fluid ounces of pure alcohol per serving. \n \n7.  TTB Should Consider Several Points Regarding Calories, Carbohydrate, Fat, \nProtein, and Sugar \n \nTTB proposes mandatory disclosure of calories  per serving, and carbohydrates, fat, and \nprotein in grams per serving.  For sugar, the Serving Facts panel may express the number of \ntotal sugars in grams per serving.   \n \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, requiring the amounts of calories, \ncarbohydrates, fat, and protein in the Serving Facts panel does not present serious concerns \nfor our members aside from those raised elsewhere in our comments (e.g., permitting \nprovision via electronic means  like a QR code ).  That said, there are at least three important \npoints that TTB should consider: \n• For carbohydrates, Wine Institute has  repeatedly expressed concern s about \ninaccuracies of the “by difference” method that TTB and FDA use for calculating \ncarbohydrates in wine.  The “by difference” method as described by Merrill and Watt in \nthe USDA publication, Energy Value of Foods: Basis and Derivation. Agriculture \nHandbook No. 74 (Merrill & Watt, 1973) is not accurate for wine.  TTB should work with \nFDA to permit the use of the more  accurate “quantitation and summation of sugars” \napproach as an approved method for calculating total carbohydrate content in wine \nand wine-based beverages. \n• In general, fat and protein amounts in wine will almost always be zero. \n• In general, California law prohibits the addition of sugar to wine.\n16 \nTTB should consider those points and perhaps seek further stakeholder input before imposing \nmandatory provision of Serving Facts. \n \n16 See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, § 17010. Page 9 of 10  \n \n8. The Proposed Rules for Tolerances, Typical Values, and Format and Placements \nOptions Should be Maintained \nTTB proposes an objective standard,  which allows a tolerance of 20 percent either above or \nbelow the labeled amount for calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.  TTB believes these \nproposed tolerances would facilitate the use of “typical values” charts and other \nmethodologies to calculate the level of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein in alcohol \nbeverage products.   \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with the proposed “objective \nstandard” tolerance of 20 percent and the continued ability to use “typical values” to calculate \ncalories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein.  Doing so will help allev iate some of the cost, \noperational, and other burdens—including the need for repeated and expensive testing—while \nstill providing adequate information.  We note, however, that most wines have very little or no \nfat or protein.  Consequently, if a winery nee ds to declare a non-zero level (e.g. less than 0.5 \ngrams per serving for fat and/or protein), a 20 percent tolerance level may be insufficient and \nindeed may be below the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the analytical \nmethod used.  We recommend that for low levels (e.g. less than one gram per serving) that an \nabsolute level be used as the specified tolerance rather than a percent  of the declared value.  \nThis concept is already used in other markets.  As an example, in the EU for declared le vels of \ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat in food that are under 10  grams/100 grams in concentration, \nthe allowed tolerances are expressed in absolute terms (i.e., +/- 2 grams for carbohydrates and \nprotein, and +/- 1.5 grams for fat).\n17 \nIf TTB imposes mandatory provision of Serving Facts, we agree with its proposal to permit much \nneeded flexibility in terms of format (e.g., panel or linear) and placement  (e.g., horizontal or \nvertical).  Likewise, we agree with TTB’s  proposal that if Serving Facts becomes  mandatory, it \nwill not require industry members to submit new C ertificate of Label Approval applications \nwhen the only change being made to a label is the inclusion, or alteration, of a required Serving \nFacts panel or statement containing alcohol content information.  These important and flexible \nelements will help alleviate some of the cost and operational burdens on wineries and provide \nflexibility to decide what works best for their products.   We reiterate, however, that the best \nsolution is to permit the provision of mandatory information via electronic means (QR codes) \nfor the many reasons stated above. \n*** \n \n \n \n17 See Table 1, Guidance Document for Competent Authorities for the Control of Compliance with EU Legislation on \nRegulation EU 1169/2011, December 2012, available at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-10/labelling_ \nnutrition -vitamins_minerals-guidance_tolerances_1212_en.pdf.

From household and \npersonal care to food and beverage products, the consumer  packaged goods (CPG) industry \nplays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy, contributing $2.5 trillion to U.S. GDP and \nsupporting 22.3 million American jobs. Consumer Brands advocates for uniform, workable, and \ndurable regulatory frameworks that are informed by risk -based science, promote consumer \nchoice, and build consumer trust across the sectors we represent. As such, we appreciate the \nopportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol, and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB or the \nAgency) proposed rule titled, “Alcohol Facts Statement in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, \nand Malt Beverages.” (Proposed Rule).  \n \nAs TTB develops labelling standards for most wine, spirits and malt beverages, we encourage it \nto allow  for the use of digital technologies to share labelling information with consumers. \nSuccinctly, we urge the agency to be flexible in how labeling information is provided, \nincluding recognizing the valuable role that digital disclosure tools like SmartLabel can \nprovide in facilitating accurate and up -to-date information ultimately leading to greater \ntransparency for consumers.   \n \nIntroduction \n \nSmartLabel® by Consumer Brands Association is a nimble, adaptable digital platform launched \nin 2015 by brand owners and grocery retailers to give consumers access to more detailed product \ninformation than could ever fit on a package. SmartLabel serves as the defacto standard for  \nconsumer transparency and allows brands to display state and federally mandated and voluntary \nlabel information . Currently 80 parent companies participate in the SmartLabel program, \nrepresenting more than 1,000 brands and over 100,000 products across all CPG categories, the \nlargest being food and beverage. SmartLabel data is maintained by the participating brands who \ncan provide  up-to-date product information with the click of a button. SmartLabel can easily \naccommodate the addition of data for wine, spirits and malt beverages.  \n \nFurther, SmartLabel can augment  federally required nutritional, ingredient , and allergen \ninformation with voluntary details that go beyond the package label such as ingredient definitions \nand sourcing  information, links to allergy prevention and management resources , as well as  SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 \nJuly 9, 2025 \nPage 2 of 10 \n \nsustainability attributes and practices.  Much of the voluntary information in SmartLabel spans \nnutrition, product claims,  certifications, and disclosures that consumers really care about.  \nConsumers interacted with the SmartLabel platform over 22 million times in calendar year 2024. \nA national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents conducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands \nAssociation found that consumers most often view the nutrition, ingredient , and allergen \ninformation on the SmartLabel pages. The survey also found that one-third of consumers have \nused SmartLabel and/or scanned a QR code to access product information  and 97% of those  \nhave used SmartLabel more than once. Almost six in ten (59%) American adults are likely to trust \nbrands that feature SmartLabel, and more than half (55%) of consumers believe that integrating \nproduct information with SmartLabel will improve their impression of the brand. Consequently, \nSmartLabel food labeling provides the product information consumers seek to make informed \ndecisions about the CPG products they purchase. \n \nSmartLabel Standardizes the Product Data Display \n \nSmartLabel complies with GS1 data standards (sourced via the Global Data Synchronisation \nNetwork or GDSN) for all attributes displayed on the platform and is a single source of up-to-date \nand accurate CPG product details because the data is directly owned, managed, updated, and \nhosted by the brand owner or the brand owner’s solution provider. Further, SmartLabel utilizes a \nuniform display and structure, which facilitates the ability of consumers to quickly and easily find \nthe information they are seeking.  \n \nSmartLabel can play an important role in providing accurate and up-to-date product information \nabout alcoholic beverages to consumers.  SmartLabel data is displayed in a consistent 5 -tab \ntemplate for all product categories  (Food and Beverage, Household Cleaning, Personal Care, \nOver-the-Counter Medications, Dietary Supplements and Pet Food)  and includes \nall federally mandated information that would be required to appear on the label  \n(except for date code labeling for infant formula, which must be provided for the \nspecific packaged product). For food and beverage products, the tabs are Nutrition, \nIngredients, Allergens, About this Product (most of the voluntary information, \nincluding claims, resides on this tab) and Company, Brand & Sustainability.  \nSmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 \nJuly 9, 2025 \nPage 3 of 10 \n \nThe product image in the header of all SmartLabel pages can be clicked to display an enlarged \nimage to aid consumers in determining if the product they have in hand matches the SmartLabel \ninformation. \n \nSmartLabel nutrition, ingredient, and allergen details are displayed in a consistent, readable \ntemplate that mirrors the information on the packaging  and allows for variations in product \nformulations. The product image in the SmartLabel template header can be clicked to display an \nenlarged image of the package, which can be helpful for people with vision impairment. \n \nSmartLabel presents FDA mandatory information (nutrition information, ingredients, allergens, \nstatement of identity, net quantity of contents, name and place of business, percent juice \ndeclaration and flavor labeling where applicable) in a consistent, easy to access and easy to read \nformat. The SmartLabel program uses implementation manuals working with brands to provide \ninformation in accordance with applicable regulations for a consistent, reliable experience for \nconsumers. For instances, the implementation manual for food and beverage prescribes that “the \nNutrition Panel must exactly mirror what appears on the physical package for single column \ndisplays. ‘Exactly’ refers to all elements of the FDA’s Nutrition Facts label design including relative \nfont sizes, indentations, alignment, and separation bar width. The Nutrition tab is not constrained \nby package size so the Nutrition Facts Panel should follow the FDA guidelines without truncation.” \nSmartLabel could implement a template that meets Alcohol/Serving Facts labelling requirements \nif any.  \n \nThe SmartLabel Trademark Licensing Agreement signed by all SmartLabel participants requires \nthem to adhere to the specifications in the SmartLabel Food and Beverage Implementation \nManual for the design and content in their SmartLabel pages. The program con ducts annual \nreviews of SmartLabel pages to make certain the data is consistent between the product \npackaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page. Elements that do not comply with \nprogrammatic and / or regulatory requirements are identified, and brands are given a reasonable \ntime frame to bring their pages into compliance.   \n \nSmartLabel is Accessible \n \nSmartLabel product pages can be accessed easily in several different ways including \nsmartphones, tablets, and computers – and allow users to view the information in an easily legible \nformat regardless of device . SmartLabel pages appear in the browser and do not require any \nsoftware to download or install to view SmartLabel.   \n \nConsumers commonly use the native camera app on a smartphone or tablet to scan the \nSmartLabel branded QR code to reach the digital product information.  SmartLabel also offers a \nfree application that can be downloaded for both iPhone and android smartphones. The app \nallows users to scan UPC barcodes for products that participate in SmartLabel. SmartLabel pages \ncan also be searched and accessed using the Sm artLabel product database \n(https://SmartLabel.org/product-search) without access to the actual package. \n \nGiven the ubiquity of smartphones and wide availability of broadband, consumers can readily \naccess SmartLabel information by scanning the SmartLabel branded QR code. USDA’s \nAgricultural Marketing Service ( AMS) has found that as of 2021, most Americans (97 percent) SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 \nJuly 9, 2025 \nPage 4 of 10 \n \nowned a smartphone of some kind.1 In particular, the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent \nof urban adults, 84 percent of suburban adults, and 80 percent of rural adults in America own a \nsmartphone2. The Pew Research Center also found that 61 percent of individuals 65 and older  \nown a smartphone.  \n \nSimilarly, QR code interactions increased by an estimated 6,200% between 2017 and 2021, with \n91% of consumers now having used a QR code at least once, and 87.1% of survey participants \nstating that QR codes are easy to use. 3 Moreover, internet access today is not the issue it once \nwas. Today, 95% of American adults have reported that they use the internet.4  \n \nFurther, SmartLabel pages comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by \nthe World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Web Accessibility Initiative, which partners with \norganizations around the world to provide a high degree of internet usability for people with \ndisabilities by: \n• ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility \n• developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and \nauthoring tools \n• developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools \n• supporting education and outreach on web accessibility \n• coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the \nweb \n• promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards \n \nThe SmartLabel Template \n \nThe SmartLabel landing page for food and beverage products is the Nutrition Tab, which \nreplicates the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) on pack, including the FDA required formatting. In-\ndepth interviews from the 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands Association \nand FMI, revealed consumers found the product information in SmartLabel to be very clear, easy \nto navigate and easy to read. Consumers explained the digital rendering of the NFP in SmartLabel \nis easier to read than the NFP on-pack. \n \n \n1 DELOITTE, Study of Electronic or Digital Link Disclosure: A Third-Party Evaluation of Challenges Impacting Access \nto Bioengineered Food Disclosure, U.S. DEP’T OF AG.

The fifth tab is also used to display \nproduct sustainability attributes like How2Recycle , Recycle Check, CIRT  and hyperlinks to \ncorporate sustainability practices. \nSmartLabel is a viable option for manufacturers to provide product information, both mandatory \nand voluntary, that may not be as readily available or in -depth on the product packaging. Other \ntypes of detailed product information that are available to consumers through SmartLabel that go \nbeyond what is commonly available on the product packaging  include information about, \nbioengineered food declarations, product certifications, sustainability attributes, and company or \nbrand information.  \n \nAdditionally, SmartLabel informs consumers that a product contains a known allergen and, if \nprovided by the manufacturer, can go further and advise if the product was made in a shared \nfacility or even on shared equipment for hyper-sensitive consumers. \n \nSmartLabel Facilitates Data Management  \n \nFor CPG manufacturers, the processes for managing digital product content generally run in \nparallel with the changes made to the physical label. Manufacturers need to determine when the \nupdated product and its label will be in market to identify when it would be appropriate to circulate \nthe updated online retail information. This determination does not follow a specific timeline  \nbecause it is based on the estimated turnover rate of the product that is in commerce.  \n \nManufacturers can update SmartLabel to accommodate reformulations in near real time . \nFurthermore, SmartLabel displays the  date of the  information up date in the footer of each \nSmartLabel page: \n \n \n \n \nConsumer Research Validates SmartLabel as a Digital Transparency Tool \n \nThrough consumer research , SmartLabel has confirmed that consumers expect the labeling \ninformation in SmartLabel to be consistent with the information on the label. As noted, the program \nSmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 \nJuly 9, 2025 \nPage 8 of 10 \n \nconducts annual reviews of SmartLabel pages to ensure the data is consistent between the \nproduct packaging and the corresponding SmartLabel page.  \n \nConsumer research conducted in 2023 by SmartLabel nationally with 1,000 respondents across \nall demographic groups found that 43% of consumers are very likely to access more product \ninformation online (compared to what is provided on the label).  \n \nFor reasons related to their family’s well-being, 80% of respondents said they would like to know \nmore about products than what is usually  on the package label . When asked about shopping \nonline, 80% of survey respondents said they seek more information about a product when \nshopping online than when shopping in-store. \n \nThe same survey found that 84% of consumers said they believe product information directly from \nthe manufacturer is most accurate. SmartLabel pages are populated directly by the brand owners. \n \nConsumers also sa id access to product information in SmartLabel is faster and easier  to read \nthan the same information on the package label . The 5 -tab SmartLabel template serves as a \nstandard and ensures consistency in the way product information is displayed  \n \nDigital Disclosure Provides Benefits to Manufacturers and Consumers \n \nThe benefits of digital labeling accrue to both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers demand \ntransparency and value the detailed ingredient, nutrition and health information  in SmartLabel. \nThey appreciate the consistency of the SmartLabel design, its organized layout and the ease of \naccess. Moreover, providing information via off -label, electronic means benefit s consumers by \nensuring they receive the most up -to-date, accurate, and more comprehensive information  \ndirectly from the product manufacturers.  A national consumer survey with 1,000 respondents \nconducted in 2023 by the Consumer Brands Association and FMI found that: \n• 58% of consumers look for SmartLabel on products  and 51% are likely to buy products \nfeaturing SmartLabel. \n• 60% of consumers are likely to trust brands that feature SmartLabel. \n• Accurate and up -to-date product information and detailed product information a re key \npurchase drivers. 26% of consumers are willing to pay more for products that offer \nadditional information through SmartLabel.  \n \nFor brand owners, the primary benefit of using the electronic or digital link disclosure option is the \nability for the industry to rapidly and efficiently update product information, therefore minimizing \npackaging costs and packaging obsolescence. Updates are influenced by numerous factors \nincluding reformulations, supplier driven changes, supply chain pressures, packaging inventory \nturnover as well as limited vendor resources. Electronic or digital disclosure provides flexibility for \nmanufacturers to quickly address product changes as ingredient supplies are updated and \nmodified. A nimble and adaptable tool allows for efficient communication and transparency, \nultimately benefiting consumers. with minimal disruptions to both the manufacturer and \nconsumers.  \nWith SmartLabel, brands don’t need to touch their packaging as often, since changes can be \nmade to the SmartLabel page on the fly. When a change is made on the SmartLabel page, it will SmartLabel® Comments to Docket No. TTB-2025-0002; Notice No. 237 \nJuly 9, 2025 \nPage 9 of 10 \n \nappear everywhere the page is hosted in real time – on the brand ecommerce pages and retail \necommerce sites. In other words, with SmartLabel, manufacturers only have to make a change \nonce, instead of on multiple platforms. As important, the ability to make real-time corrections and \nprovide real-time information can streamline and aid regulatory enforcement efforts associated \nwith any new and mandatory labeling rules. \n \nGS1 Sunrise 2027 is Just Around the Corner \n \nSmartLabel is collaborating with GS1 US in prepara tion for Sunrise 2027 – the transition from \nUPC barcodes to 2D barcodes (Digital Links). With a single scan on a smartphone, a GS1 digital \nlink-enabled SmartLabel QR code will allow consumers to access nutritional information, \nallergens, sustainability and sourcing data on the SmartLabel product page. That same QR code \ncan be scanned at the point-of-sale (POS) checkout counter for price lookup and a variety of other \nsupply chain processes related to inventory management and recall readiness. More information \non GS1 Sunrise 2027 and 2D barcodes can be found here.

SmartLabel and its  implementers are \ncommitted to consumer transparency, enhancing trust in the CPG industry, and ensuring that \nconsumers can make informed product purchasing decisions. The TTB has an important role to \nplay in supporting the standardization of labeling information and supporting innovation  and \nflexibility by permitting the use of digital technology to provide  core regulatory information to \nconsumers.

Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) is the national trade association representing the wholesale tier of the wine and spirits industry. Founded in 1943, WSWA represents companies in all 50 States and the District of Columbia that hold federal permits and state licenses to act as wine and/or spirits distributors and/or brokers.   As an initial matter, WSWA strongly supports TTB’s work to implement the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) labeling requirements and views them as a critical tool to inform consumers while allowing for flexibility and innovation within the industry. We applaud efforts to modernize this system to meet evolving needs and advances in technology.  Our comment is limited to two elements of the proposal. First, we comment on Section VII.B.8.C regarding the electronic display of alcohol facts information. Secondly, we comment on Section VII.B.9 regarding serving size reference amounts.  I. Electronic Display of Alcohol Facts Information    The proposal seeks comment on whether a final rule should allow the proposed Alcohol Facts information to be disclosed via electronic means. We appreciate the perspectives TTB has received in previous comments both in support and opposition to electronic disclosure and agree with those commenters who have suggested Quick Response (QR) codes provide flexibility for industry members while empowering consumers with detailed, easy to ready information on an electronic device. As the proposal notes, rapid advancements are underway in technology and consumer expectations around how information is accessed, and we believe these factors will only increase in coming years making such technologies even more mainstream.  Further, QR-based information is already in use in many global alcohol markets where it is currently demonstrating its utility. With a simple capture of the code on the phone, all relevant information can be displayed in a clear, easy to decipher format in seconds.   Specific to readability, we note that QR codes can provide consumers with larger font sizes than the 1 millimeter minimum for wine and spirits and may provide a useful mechanism for viewing alcohol facts   \n     \ninformation in an easier to read format than some labels may provide. Often the QR view fills a smartphone screen and provides significantly more text size than would be found on a physical label, especially those for 50ml and other smaller standards of fill. Such flexibility addresses the very issues raised with linear display and type size for smaller containers.   We encourage TTB to allow electronic means as a mode of compliance for any new label requirements that may be promulgated.   II. Alcohol Expressed in Fluid Ounces may Lead to Consumer Confusion  Secondly, regarding serving size reference amounts, we comment on the questions posed in section VII.B.9 of the proposal. Specifically, we respectfully suggest that the proposed reference amounts will create unnecessary consumer confusion around what constitutes a “serving”. We recognize the proposal does not intend for the reference amounts to be “recommended consumption amounts”, but we believe they could easily be interpreted as such by consumers.   Under the proposal, consumers could be led to believe that, for instance, a distilled spirits product of 16% ABV or below is intended to be consumed in a 5-ounce serving. This is not universally true as many spirit products under this threshold are intended for use in smaller servings. In this case, having the 5-ounce serving could promote confusion around “real-world” calorie and alcohol content amounts. Similarly, in the expanding world of ready-to-drink cocktails, many similar products exist on both sides of the proposed 7% ABV delineation between 12- and 5-ounce serving references. This too could lead to significant consumer confusion around what a “serving” is intended to be for two very similar products. We encourage TTB to consider alternatives to this approach.   WSWA applauds TTB for this important work around how consumers access information and urges TTB to ensure that any changes required by a final rule avoid creating unnecessary consumer confusion and allow for industry members to utilize prevalent technology to satisfy new regulatory requirements.  Thank you for your consideration of our perspective on these important matters.

ADSA members produce over sixty percent of all the distilled spirits \nsold i n the U.S.  Previously known as the Presidents’ Forum of the Distilled Spirits \nIndustry, ADSA traces its history back over 40 years.   \nADSA and its members share TTB’s commitment to ensuring that consumers have \naccess to accurate and meaningful information about the products they purchase and \nconsume. We recognize the importance of transparency, particularly with respect to \nalcohol conten t and allergens that may affect consumer safety. At the same time, we \nbelieve that any regulatory changes must be carefully calibrated to avoid confusing \nconsumers, imposing unnecessary costs on producers, or disrupting established trade \npractices in the United States and abroad. \nIn these comments, ADSA responds to questions posed by TTB, offering \nrecommendations based on decades of industry experience, consumer research, and \nlessons learned from both domestic and foreign regulatory approaches. We emphasize \nthree overarching principles: \n1. The need for flexibility in how information is disclosed, particularly through the \nuse of QR codes and digital tools; \n2. The importance of avoiding unnecessary or misleading ingredient \ndisclosures that do not reflect the actual composition of distilled spirits; and \n \n1 90 FR 6654 (Jan. 17, 2025).   \n \nTTB-2025-0002 \nPage 2 of 6 \n \n3. The critical role of collaborative, phased rulemaking  with adequate time for \nimplementation, tailored to U.S. market conditions rather than imported wholesale \nfrom jurisdictions like the European Union. \nCurrent Labeling Rules and Consumer Understanding \nWe believe that current labeling rules already provide consumers with the essential \ninformation they need to make informed decisions, including alcohol content by volume, \nclass or type of spirit, and required health warnings. These disclosures, together wi th \nlong-standing standards of identity for distilled spirits, ensure that consumers understand \nthe basic characteristics of the products they are purchasing. \nThat said, ADSA acknowledges that consumer groups and other stakeholders have \nexpressed a desire for more information, particularly regarding serving size and potential \nallergens. We support TTB’s consideration of these issues but caution against expanding \nlabeling requirements in ways that would overload labels with text, lead to consumer \nconfusion, or introduce inconsistencies across product categories. A one -size-fits-all \nmandate will not achieve the goal of clarity for consumers and may instead obscure key \ninformation. \nModern technology provides tools that were not available when current labeling rules \nwere first established. QR codes, in particular, can bridge the gap between static on-pack \ninformation and consumers’ growing appetite for detailed data. By allowing produ cers to \nprovide additional information digitally, QR codes prevent label clutter, enable regular \nupdates without costly reprinting, and give consumers access to more robust product data \nthan could reasonably fit on a label. We strongly encourage TTB to recognize QR codes \nas a central solution for future disclosures. \nA proven precedent exists in SmartLabel, a digital disclosure tool that has transformed \nhow brands communicate product information. SmartLabel allows participating brands to \ndisplay both state and federally mandated as well as voluntary label information in a clear, \nconsistent, and consumer-friendly format. Currently, 80 parent companies—representing \nmore than 1,000 brands and 100,000 products across all consumer -packaged goods \ncategories, most prominently food and beverage—use the program. \nThe data is maintained by participating brands, who can update product information \ninstantly, ensuring accuracy and timeliness without costly physical label changes. This \nmodel enables manufacturers to present mandatory and voluntary information that may \nbe too detailed to fit on traditional packaging, while still ensuring consumer access. In the \nFDA context, SmartLabel presents required disclosures —such as nutrition facts, \ningredients, allergens, statement of identity, net quantity, name and place of busin ess, \npercent juice declarations, and flavor labeling —using a consistent and easy -to-read \ninterface. \nIn-depth interviews from a 2021 national survey conducted by the Consumer Brands \nAssociation and the Food Marketing Institute revealed that consumers found  \n \nTTB-2025-0002 \nPage 3 of 6 \n \nSmartLabel’s product information very clear, easy to navigate, and easy to read. The \nstrong adoption by brands and positive reception by consumers show that a well -\nstructured digital disclosure tool enhances transparency and consumer confidence. \nBy embracing QR codes and similar digital platforms for alcohol beverage labeling, the \nagency can facilitate timely, accurate, and complete disclosures without overburdening \npackaging, producers, or consumers. The SmartLabel model proves that this approach  \ncan work across a highly diverse marketplace, balancing regulatory needs with industry \ninnovation and consumer expectations. \nAlcohol Content, Nutritional Information, and Serving Facts \nAlcohol content per serving is one of the most important pieces of information consumers \ncan have. Current rules require ABV disclosures for spirits, but similar requirements do \nnot apply consistently across all beverage types. As a result, consumers are left to guess \nhow a serving of beer, wine, or spirits relates to U.S. Dietary Guidelines defining a \n“standard drink” as 0.6 fluid ounces (14 grams) of pure alcohol. We recommend that TTB \nstandardize alcohol content disclosures across categories, requiring b oth ABV and \nalcohol content per serving to give consumers clear, comparable information. To promote \nresponsible consumption, all serving sizes should be set equal to a standard drink. \nProviding for a “single serving” that differs from a standard drink woul d confuse \nconsumers; if there is more than one standard drink in a container, the label should state \nthe number of standard drinks. \nWe encourage TTB to use “Serving Facts” rather than “Alcohol Facts” as the title for the \ninformational statement. Because the required disclosures will include both nutrient and \nalcohol content information, “Serving Facts” is a broader and more accurate de scriptor. \nThis approach also avoids costly label updates for producers who already voluntarily use \n“Serving Facts” under current policy. \nWe support allowing flexibility in format, including the linear display option, which is \nalready in widespread voluntary use and easily located by consumers. For certain small \nformats—such as 50ml containers —we recommend an exemption from alcohol facts \nlabeling, as space constraints make meaningful on -pack disclosure impractical. We \nfurther reiterate our request to permit off-pack disclosure through a website or QR code, \nensuring consumers have access to complete and current information without \noverburdening packaging. \nNutritional information such as calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and alcohol content \ncan be useful to consumers, but TTB should not require other nutrients or elements (such \nas sodium, caffeine, sugar, cholesterol, fiber, vitamins, minerals, or fat breakdown) to be \nlisted, as this may convey unintended nutritional or health value. Nor should TTB require \ninclusion of a summary of the Dietary Guidelines’ advice on moderate drinking. \nWe also recommend that TTB allow compliance via a Statement of Average Analysis for \nproducts where exact alcohol content is not known at the time of label creation, such as  \n \nTTB-2025-0002 \nPage 4 of 6 \n \n“cask strength” whiskeys. This flexibility would preserve accuracy while recognizing \nproduction realities. \nIn response to TTB’s question regarding the extent of current voluntary nutrition labeling, \nwe note that many ADSA members already provide nutrition content information, with \nsome doing so across their entire portfolios. This demonstrates that industry members \nare already responsive to consumer interest in this information without a rigid, one -size-\nfits-all mandate. \nIngredient Lists and Why They May Mislead Consumers \nWe continue to believe that requiring full ingredient lists for distilled spirits would not help \nconsumers make informed choices and may, in fact, mislead them. Distillation is a \ntransformative process that removes nearly all traces of the raw materials us ed in \nproduction. For example, while wheat may be the starting material for vodka, the final \ndistilled product contains no gluten proteins or other remnants of the grain. Listing “wheat” \nas an ingredient on such a product could lead consumers with celiac d isease to avoid it \nunnecessarily, or others to assume that vodka contains nutritional qualities associated \nwith wheat, neither of which is true. \nTTB has previously recognized this problem, and its long-standing position—affirmed by \nthe courts—is that ingredient lists for distilled spirits provide little value and may even \nmisinform consumers. Standards of identity and statements of composition alre ady tell \nconsumers what type of spirit they are purchasing (e.g., gin, Scotch whisky, rum), and \nthese designations are widely understood. There is no evidence that ingredient lists would \nenhance consumer understanding beyond what is already provided. \nIn contrast, the European Union has taken a different approach, requiring ingredient lists \nand certain nutritional information on alcoholic beverages. However, EU regulatory \nsystems are harmonized across food and beverage categories and operate under \ndifferent legal frameworks. Importing EU-style requirements into the U.S. would not align \nwith our domestic labeling standards, would create significant costs for U.S. producers \nexporting overseas, and could disrupt international trade. U.S. policy should be guided by \nU.S. consumer needs and our established regulatory approach, not by wholesale \nadoption of foreign rules. \nAllergen Disclosure and Consumer Safety \nADSA supports mandatory disclosure of allergens where science shows that allergens \nremain present in the final product and may pose a risk to consumers. We recommend \nthat TTB align definitions of “major allergens” with the Food Allergen Labeling and \nConsumer Protection Act while acknowledging that distilled spirits frequently contain no \nallergenic proteins from their raw materials. Where allergens are fully removed during \nproduction, no disclosure should be required.  \n \nTTB-2025-0002 \nPage 5 of 6 \n \nAs is already the case in some jurisdictions, allergens that are clearly indicated in the \nproduct name—such as “hazelnut liqueur”—should not require duplicative labeling. Over-\ndisclosure could create confusion or cause unnecessary concern for consumers. \nCost Implications and Small Business Impacts \nThe costs of implementing new labeling mandates would be substantial. Producers would \nface expenses related to product testing, formula verification, label redesign, and legal \ncompliance reviews. These costs would be particularly burdensome for small or ne w \nbusinesses, many of which lack the resources to conduct laboratory analysis or manage \nmultiple label redesigns. \nTo mitigate these burdens, ADSA strongly urges TTB to adopt a phased implementation \nperiod of at least five years and to avoid piecemeal rulemaking that would require multiple \nrounds of expensive changes. A single effective date for all labeling changes would help \nbusinesses plan and budget appropriately. We also applaud TTB for withdrawing the \ningredient labeling rulemaking and for proposing a 5 -year implementation period in both \nthe alcohol facts and major food allergens rulemakings. \nQR codes and web -based disclosures can further reduce costs by eliminating the need \nfor frequent physical label changes while still providing consumers with the detailed \ninformation they may seek. \nThe Need for Collaborative Rulemaking \nLabeling regulations are fundamental to consumer understanding, market integrity, and \ninternational trade. Any changes to these rules must be science -based, practical, and \ntailored to U.S. market conditions. ADSA urges TTB to continue engaging with \nstakeholders before drafting final rules, conducting thorough cost -benefit analyses, and \nconsidering real-world production practices. Rules that are too rigid, overly burdensome, \nor modeled on foreign systems will not serve U.S. consumers or producers effectively. \nWe welcome the opportunity to participate in future dialogue, workshops, or advisory \ngroups to help develop labeling rules that provide genuine value to consumers while \npreserving the competitiveness of the U.S. distilled spirits industry. \n* * * \nADSA appreciates TTB’s leadership in evaluating these important issues and its \nwillingness to engage industry stakeholders in the process. We support mandatory \ndisclosure of alcohol content per serving and science -based allergen disclosures, \nprovided they accurately reflect the final product. We oppose ingred ient lists for distilled \nspirits because they are scientifically inaccurate and potentially misleading. We strongly \nencourage TTB to adopt flexible, modern disclosure methods, particularly QR codes, \nwhich meet consumer needs without imposing undue burdens on producers or creating \ncluttered, confusing labels.  \n \nTTB-2025-0002 \nPage 6 of 6 \n \nMost importantly, we urge TTB to proceed collaboratively, engaging in an open and \niterative rulemaking process that reflects U.S. realities rather than importing foreign \napproaches ill-suited to our market. ADSA and its members stand ready to work with TTB \nto ensure that future labeling rules are clear, effective, and practical for both consumers \nand producers. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAmanda Nguyen \nPresident & CEO \nAmerican Distilled Spirits Alliance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'I write as President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirits Alliance (&ldquo;ADSA&rdquo;) to provide the collective comments of ADSA members on TTB&rsquo;s Notice No. 237, Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.

Our members represent all industries and \napplications that depend on trusted product information from manufacturing and supply chain to \nhealthcare, retail, and consumer goods. For over 50 years, AIM has advanced the adoption of open, \ninternational standards to improve data quality, enhance transparency, and empower informed \ndecision-making. \n \nOur Position \nAIM strongly supports TTB’s goal of improving consumer access to accurate, standardized \ninformation on alcohol beverage labels. Transparency is central to consumer trust, and \nstandardized labeling built on internationally recognized data formats and identification systems \nensures that the information provided is not only accurate and readable but also interoperable \nacross platforms, supply chains, and digital environments. \n \nWe believe that: \n \n• Standardization is essential – Mandatory “Alcohol Facts” labeling should use consistent \ndata structures and presentation formats so that the information can be reliably \nunderstood by consumers, regulators, and digital systems alike. Utilizing recognized \nstandards such as ISO/IEC 15459-1:2014 (Information technology — Automatic \nidentification and data capture techniques — Unique identification Unique Identifiers) \nISO/IEC 18004:2024 (Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture \ntechniques — QR Code bar code symbology specification) and ISO/IEC 30161-1:2020 (Internet of Things (IoT) — Data exchange platform for IoT services Part 1: General \nrequirements and architecture) will help ensure consistency and interoperability. \n• Digital access complements physical labels – Alongside printed information, machine-\nreadable data carriers (such as standardized barcodes or QR Codes linked to authoritative \nproduct data) can provide extended content, including multilingual details, allergen alerts, \nand sustainability information. The use of GS1 General Specifications, including GS1 \nDataMatrix and GS1 Digital Link standards, will ensure that the “Alcohol Facts” label can \nintegrate seamlessly into domestic and international distribution, retail, and e-commerce \nsystems. \n• Interoperability enables efficiency – Leveraging established AIDC standards and best \npractices can help industry meet compliance requirements while reducing costs and errors, \nparticularly for companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. \n \nAIM’s Offer of Support \nAs the recognized authority for AIDC standards and best practices, AIM is willing to assist TTB and \nthe industry in developing the technical guidance and frameworks necessary to implement these \nrequirements effectively. We can provide expertise on: \n• Selection and application of appropriate data carriers \n• Data encoding standards to ensure interoperability \n• Integration guidance of physical and digital labeling for consumer engagement and \nregulatory compliance \n \nWe commend TTB for advancing this initiative and share its commitment to protecting \nconsumers, fostering transparency, and supporting fair competition. We welcome the opportunity \nto participate in future discussions or technical working groups that will help ensure the \nsuccessful rollout of standardized alcohol labeling. \n \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n \nChuck Evanhoe     Mary Lou Bosco \nChair, AIM Board     CEO, AIM Global \nPresident, Aware Innovations   marylou@aimglobal.org \n       724-742-4473 \n \n \n  \n'}, {'source': 'DIRECT (NON-ATTACHMENT)', 'text': 'On behalf of AIM we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau&rsquo;s (TTB) proposed rule to require &ldquo;Alcohol Facts&rdquo; statements on alcohol beverage labels.'}]",TTB-2025-0002-0190,TTB-2025-0002-0001,Public Submission,2025-08-18 17:06:09,,False,"Comment 187:  AIM, Inc.",09000064b8f0105d,2025-08-18 04:00:00,2025-09-05 01:04:35,On behalf of AIM we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau&rsquo;s (TTB) proposed rule to require &ldquo;Alcohol Facts&rdquo; statements on alcohol beverage labels.,med-4pnt-d1oc,,Comment(s),0,,,Warrendale,PA,,United States,,,,,,,,2025-08-15 04:00:00,1,2025-08-21 00:38:48,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,27,"[27, -1, -1]",27,-1,-1

Our association represents more than 1,200 cider and perry producers across the United States&mdash;from orchard-based family operations to regional brands selling across multiple states. While our members vary in size and structure, they are unified by their commitment to transparency, craftsmanship, and agricultural tradition.<br/><br/>We support the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau&rsquo;s (TTB) goal of modernizing beverage alcohol labeling to ensure consumers have clear, consistent access to information about what they&rsquo;re drinking. However, we respectfully urge the TTB to consider the operational impact of these changes on small and agricultural-based producers&mdash;particularly those in the cider sector.<br/><br/>Nutritional Labeling Requirements<br/>The proposed nutritional labeling requirement presents one of the most significant challenges for small cideries&mdash;many of which are closely tied to local agriculture and farm-based production. Cider makers often rely on fruit grown on their own farms or purchased from nearby orchards, supporting agricultural diversity and rural economies. Many producers do not have access to in-house laboratories and would be required to send each product&mdash;or in many cases, each vintage or seasonal batch&mdash;out for expensive third-party testing. This would be cost prohibitive for many and could discourage the use of varied, seasonal fruit that reflects annual harvest conditions.<br/><br/>We strongly encourage the TTB to adopt a tiered approach to nutritional labeling, including:<br/>- Exemptions or simplified compliance pathways for producers under a defined annual production threshold, similar to the FDA&rsquo;s model for small food manufacturers.<br/>- The option to provide average or representative nutritional values rather than batch-specific data.<br/>- Permission to disclose nutritional information digitally via QR code &mdash; a system that is already accepted under the European Union&rsquo;s labeling requirements. This approach would promote international regulatory alignment, minimize packaging changes, and allow consumers ready access to accurate product information without imposing undue cost or operational burdens on producers. For limited-release, non-packaged, or taproom-only products, QR codes would allow minimal testing requirements while still meeting transparency goals.<br/><br/>Without such accommodations, the cost and logistical burden of compliance could significantly affect the smallest and most innovative segments of the cider industry&mdash;many of which are rooted in agriculture and depend on flexibility to highlight the diversity of fruit from year to year.<br/><br/>Label Flexibility for Small-Batch and Direct-to-Consumer Products<br/>Innovation is a hallmark of the craft cider movement. Many of our members release limited-edition blends, experimental fermentations, or single-varietal ciders in small volumes&mdash;sometimes only a few kegs or cases. These products are often sold directly to consumers and are not distributed through traditional retail channels.<br/><br/>For these types of products, we ask the TTB to allow more flexible labeling options, including:<br/>- Universal batch-level nutritional and allergen disclosures available on-premise or online.<br/>- Expanded use of QR codes to communicate required information without relabeling every SKU.<br/><br/>Implementation Timeline and Industry Support<br/>Should these proposed labeling changes be adopted, it is critical that cideries&mdash;especially those with limited staffing and infrastructure&mdash;are given sufficient time and support to comply. We support the phased rollout of the final rule, with five years of lead time for producers to comply.<br/><br/>In addition, we recommend the development of technical guidance materials, including sample label formats and FAQs. These resources would help ensure that the final rule is not only effective, but also achievable.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>We support the TTB&rsquo;s goal of creating a more transparent and consumer-friendly labeling system across all alcohol categories. At the same time, we believe it is essential to preserve the diversity and accessibility of our industry, which includes many small, regional, and agricultural producers who will be disproportionately affected by these changes.<br/><br/>With thoughtful modifications, this rule can accomplish both goals&mdash;empowering consumers and supporting the sustainability of small producers.

These products are often sold directly to consumers and are not distributed through traditional retail channels.<br/><br/>For these types of products, we ask the TTB to allow more flexible labeling options, including:<br/>- Universal batch-level nutritional and allergen disclosures available on-premise or online.<br/>- Expanded use of QR codes to communicate required information without relabeling every SKU.<br/><br/>Implementation Timeline and Industry Support<br/>Should these proposed labeling changes be adopted, it is critical that cideries&mdash;especially those with limited staffing and infrastructure&mdash;are given sufficient time and support to comply. We support the phased rollout of the final rule, with five years of lead time for producers to comply.<br/><br/>In addition, we recommend the development of technical guidance materials, including sample label formats and FAQs. These resources would help ensure that the final rule is not only effective, but also achievable.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>We support the TTB&rsquo;s goal of creating a more transparent and consumer-friendly labeling system across all alcohol categories. At the same time, we believe it is essential to preserve the diversity and accessibility of our industry, which includes many small, regional, and agricultural producers who will be disproportionately affected by these changes.<br/><br/>With thoughtful modifications, this rule can accomplish both goals&mdash;empowering consumers and supporting the sustainability of small producers. We appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective and look forward to working with the TTB as this rulemaking process continues.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Monica Cohen, CEO<br/>American Cider Association",med-kjry-hc3d,,Comment(s),0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-08-15 04:00:00,0,2025-08-21 00:38:45,Proposed Rule,"Notice No. 237:  Alcohol Facts Statements in the Labeling of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages",2025-01-17 05:00:00,TTB-2025-0002,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),TTB,2025-01-17 05:00:00,2025-08-16 03:59:59,"27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 24, 25, and 27",2025-00957,90 FR 6654,6654 – 6706,0,31,"[31, 5, 12]",31,5,12

Reg. 6654 (January 17, \n2025)    \n \nDear Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Eilers:   \n  \nThe National Association of Beverage Importers (NABI) greatly appreciates the opportunity to \nprovide comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on Alcohol Facts Labeling.1  \nIn the past, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has referred to this \ninformation as “Serving Facts.”   \n  \nThe topic here is more longstanding than simply the Treasury Report on Competition2 cited by \nTTB.  For the past 20 years, TTB has considered the Serving Facts rulemaking and issued an \nadministrative ruling on this topic, along with proposed rulemaking, and nutritional labeling \nguidance.  TTB has a continuing experience with this labeling topic.  And as noted during the \nlistening sessions, several public advocacy groups have filed Federal litigation to seek action \n \n1 Prior to the publication of this notice, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) held two virtual \n“Listening1 Sessions” on these topics in February 2024, and NABI presented a statement and submitted a written \ncomment at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/TTB-2024-0002-0416   \n2 This report resulted from President Biden’s Executive Order 14036, Promoting Competition in the American \nEconomy, dated July 9, 2021 at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/14/2021-15069/promoting-\ncompetition-in-the-american-economy  On August 13, 2025, the President issued an Executive Order that revoked \nExecutive Order 14036 at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/revocation-of-executive-order-\non-competition/    The Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission applauded this action as “protecting everyday \nAmericans from anticompetitive practices through tailored action, promoting economic growth, and ensuring that \nAmerican workers benefit from competition for their labor.” at https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-\nreleases/2025/08/ftc-chairman-applauds-revocation-biden-harris-executive-order-\ncompetition?utm_source=govdelivery   \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  2 \n \nhere and that litigation is stayed (and not dismissed) during the pendency of this current \nrulemaking.    \n \nTTB has dealt with rulemaking and administrative rulings on these issues during the George W. \nBush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joseph Biden Administrations.  Typically, the \nregulatory climate of Washington, DC changes with each new Administration. The current \nAdministration has issued several executive orders on the promulgation of new regulations and \nreview of existing regulations to ensure “regulations [are] squarely authorized by constitutional \nFederal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome \nadministrative state.”3  Additionally, the trend of recent United States Supreme Court judicial \ndecisions on review of regulations has changed where agencies now face a higher burden to \nshow that the regulation is authorized by the underlying statute.4   \n \nThe proposed regulations were published for public comment before the current Administration \ntook office.  NABI believes they will face a higher bar of review and clearance by \nAdministration officials and by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in particular. \nAccordingly, NABI’s comments recognize the regulatory climate of the current Administration \nand the higher bar facing TTB in a judicial review of its regulations.       \n \nNABI respectfully recommends that the alcohol facts statements regulation remain as a voluntary \nstatement that may appear on a label or is accessible to consumers by a Quick Response (QR) \ncode.   \n \n       \nSufficiency of Voluntary Alcohol Facts Statement \n \nTTB has dealt with the “Servings Fact”-type label disclosure regulatory considerations through \nproposed regulations and a TTB Ruling.  The proposed Alcohol Facts Statement labeling \nregulations require the same elements of information as the voluntary Serving Facts label: \n \n• Serving Size \n• Servings per Container \n• Alcohol by volume \n \n3 Executive Order, dated February 19, 2025, titled “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the \nPresident’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory” Initiative.”  \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-\npresidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/  \nExecutive Order, dated January 31, 2025, titled “Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation.”     \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/  \nPresidential Memorandum, dated April 9, 2025,“Memorandum for the Head of Departments and Agencies, \nDirecting the Repeal of Unlawful Regulations”    https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\nactions/2025/04/directing-the-repeal-of-unlawful-regulations/   \nExecutive Order, dated May 9, 2025, titled “Fighting Over Criminalization in Federal Regulations” at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/fighting-overcriminalization-in-federal-regulations/  and \nWhite House Fact Sheet at https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-\nfights-overcriminalization-in-federal-regulations/    \n4 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S.369 (2024) overruling Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).  3 \n \n• Fluid ounces of Alcohol per Serving   \n• Calories \n• Carbohydrate by grams \n• Fat by grams \n• Protein by grams  \n \nThe information may appear in a panel or in a linear display.   \n \nThe current requirements for the voluntary use of the Serving Facts label were issued in TTB \nRuling 2013-2, May 28, 2013, V oluntary Nutrient Content Statements in the Labeling and \nAdvertising of Wines, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.5   \n \nThe current proposed rulemaking seeks comments on whether the Alcohol Facts Statement label \nshould be mandatory information on a label affixed to the container or continue to be voluntary.  \nThe proposal also seeks comments on multiple options about the presentation of the label. In this \nregard, NABI is only commenting on the use of the electronic alternative to communicate the \nvoluntary information to consumers.   \n \nMandatory or Voluntary \n \nUnder the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,6 TTB is authorized to issue labeling regulations \nthat, among other things, will provide “adequate information as to the identify and quality of the \nproducts.”  TTB has broad discretion in issuing regulations under this standard.7  While the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) is required to issue such food labeling requirements on the \nnutrient statement under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, TTB is not covered \nby that law.  Accordingly, TTB’s decision to issue the Alcohol Facts/Serving Fact requirement is \ndiscretionary.   \n \nA review of the Supplementary Information on comments submitted previously to TTB opposing \nthe Serving Facts label requirement shows that the singular opposition raised is the potential \ncosts associated with a mandatory requirement.  In particular, the burden of these product testing \ncosts on small and medium size importers and producers was noted.8  \n \nNABI agrees that this information may be valuable to many consumers and believes that many \nindustry members will include it voluntarily on a label or in a QR code reference.  TTB lists a \nnumber of steps it has taken to mitigate these costs, such as increased tolerance ranges, use of \ntypicity charts, and the five-year transition period.   A pivotal concern is whether making this \nrequirement mandatory will attract or raise concerns in the regulatory approval process which \nwould not arise were the requirement remains voluntary.  \n \n \n5  https://www.ttb.gov/media/72036/download?inline   \n6  27 USC 205(e)(2).   \n7 Center for Science in the Public Interest v. Department of Treasury, 797 F. 2d 995 (D.C. Cir. 1986) at \nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/797/995/104822/  \n8 See, 90 Federal Register at 6664 (January 17, 2025) 4 \n \nIn a survey of NABI members, many of the following reasons were cited for keeping the Alcohol \nFact Statement voluntary.  \n \n• The voluntary option has worked.  Industry members can present this information if they \nbelieve that their consumers want it. \n• Congress did not enact a specific legal requirement for the Alcohol Facts/Serving Facts label \nfor beverage alcohol unlike other beverages.   \n• The information must be understandable to the consumer.  For example, does the average \nconsumer know what a serving size is?  It is not explained on the label and the consumer \nwould have to look at a chart in the regulations in order to determine it.  Similarly, do \nconsumers understand that the disclosures of quantities are subject to a tolerance of plus or \nminus 20 percent? \n• Have the petitioners established and do the past comments show that consumers want all of \nthis information?   \n• Compliance costs are passed along to consumers in higher prices.  \n• The necessary testing is expensive and is recurring.  While TTB cites ways to mitigate the \ncosts, do those undercut the value of the information for the consumer?  Broader tolerances \nand typicity charts provide less accurate and more general information to consumers.  \n• Logistical challenges of the global market in these products arise where labeled product \nenter U.S. to be shipped to another country’s market where that country does not allow the \ninformation presented in the same manner as does the U.S.    \n• From a cost perspective, a five-year implementation date still poses economic challenges to \nnew entrants near the effective date or those who enter the business after the effective date.   \n• Quick Response (QR) codes are a good option but still have costs to update and maintain.   \n• V oluntary option is consistent with the Administration’s executive directives that regulations \nmust not be burdensome and must be based on clear statutory authorization.   \n• Importers are currently under economic stress due to the tariffs and this labeling requirement \nis an additional expense to mandate now.   \n \nThese reasons support maintaining the Alcohol Fact/Serving Facts.as voluntary information.   \n \n \nQuick Response (QR) Codes for Voluntary Alcohol Facts Statements are Valuable if \nProperly Regulated \n  \nQuick Response (QR) codes are valuable for conveying large amounts of information about a \nproduct without cluttering a front, neck, and back label given the limited physical “real estate” \non a bottle or other consumer container.    \n  \nNABI supports the use of a QR code.  The quality and quantity of additional information that \nmay be given to a consumer via the QR code is enormous and, moreover, the QR code allows \nthis additional information to be updated constantly at a cost to the industry that is far less than a \npaper label.  The QR code gives the industry member the opportunity to include some \nexplanation about the element of information that would not otherwise be available on the \nlimited ""real estate"" of labels on the bottle or container.  Moreover, broad generational 5 \n \nacceptance of e-devices and I-phones necessitate their use today. Consumers today look for the \nQR code on a label as an information resource.     \n  \nThere is certain information about the wine, distilled spirits, and beer/malt beverages that must \nbe available to all consumers and appear on a label on the bottle or consumer container.  The \nbrand name, class and type of wine or distilled spirit or category of beer, name of the producer \nand/or bottler, and alcohol content are the elements of information that fall within this category.  \nThe alcohol by volume (ABV) content should appear on the label while the additional details \nprovided in the alcohol facts statement could be accessed through the QR code.     \n  \nFinally, as a practical matter, for a country like the United States that has a pre-approval review \nof labels, how does TTB envision the label specialist reviewing the QR code information?  The \ninformation on the QR code site would need to comply with the TTB advertising regulations.9  \nWould the importer have to submit a transcript or copy of all of the information behind the QR \ncode?  Given the importer must obtain the certificate of label approval (COLA) and it is possible \nthat the foreign producer will operate the QR code site, the importer will need to monitor the QR \ncode sites that appear on the label.  Whatever approach is adopted by TTB, it must be reasonably \nadministrable in order to protect the consumer.     \n  \nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or requests for clarification.  NABI greatly \nappreciates your time on this important public policy decision.  \n  \nSincerely,   \n  \n Robert M. Tobiassen   \nRobert M.

Its \npurpose is to  strengthen the identity of the spirit by disseminating good practices, promoting joint \nprojects and generating a positive impact on producing communities. With a focus on innovative  \nsolutions, the Alliance seeks to accelerate change and preserve the artisanal tradition that  defines \nMezcal.  \n \nThe Mezcal Sustainability Alliance thanks the TTB  for notifying its proposed regulation to the TBT \nCommittee, in compliance with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, in \naccordance with article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, which establishes that notifications of technical \nregulations should occur at a stage where comments can be considered and modifications to the initial \nproposal can be made. \n \nBackground \n \nOn January 17, 2025, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. published a \nproposal (Notice No. 237 ) to amend the labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The \nmain objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the \nalcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods \n \nKey points of the proposal: \n• ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel:  The creation of a mandatory panel on alcoholic beverage labels is \nproposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include  alcohol \ncontent per serving; calories per serving; basic nutrients; standard serving size and number \nof servings per container .  The proposal establishes specific serving sizes for each type of \nalcoholic beverage, which vary depending on their alcohol content.   \n• Flexible presentation formats:  The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different \nformats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. \n \n \n \n \n \n• Compliance Period : A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal \nRegister is proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. \n \nGeneral comments on the proposal:  \n \nAlcohol content \nIt is acknowledged that declaring the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is important to \ninform consumers and help prevent harmful consumption. However, expressing this content in fluid \nounces of pure ethanol per serving is considered unnecessari ly complex and not easily understood by \nthe average consumer. Therefore, it is recommended that only alcohol by volume (% ABV) be declared, \nand that this information be allowed anywhere on the label as long as it is clearly visible, without \nrequiring placement in a specific panel or format. \n \nServing and servings per container: \nThe proposal aims to standardize the declaration of serving size and number of servings per container \nacross all regulated alcoholic beverages, placing this information within the “Alcohol Facts” panel. \nWhile it is considered essential for consumers to understand how much alcohol is in a container and in \na standard drink to promote moderation, it is suggested that this information be provided voluntarily. If \nmandated, it should be included through electronic labeling (e.g., QR code, digital platform, or website), \nwhich would ensure access to relevant information without imposing unnecessary regulatory or \ncommercial burdens. \n \nNutritional information \n \nThe proposal seeks to include nutritional information —such as calories, carbohydrates, fats, and \nproteins—within the “Alcohol Facts” panel on alcoholic beverage labels. However, this approach may \nconfuse consumers by implying that alcoholic beverages offer  nutritional benefits, which contradicts \nCodex Alimentarius guidelines that prohibit the addition or promotion of nutrients in alcohol. Alcohol \n \nshould not be considered a food or nutrient and presenting it as such could mislead consumers into \nviewing it as comparable to non -alcoholic beverages, potentially influencing purchasing decisions \nbased on inappropriate criteria. This could divert attention from the health risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption and negatively impact public health perceptions. \n \n \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient content labeling statement be more consistent with the \nNutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? \nAlternatively, do the differences between alcohol beverages and other foods make it \nunnecessary, or even misleading, to adopt the type of nutrient labeling required on food \nlabels that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the \npercentage of the daily value of the listed nutrients provided by alcohol beverages be useful \ninformation for consumers? Alternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by \nimplying that they may rely on alcohol beverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily \nnutrient requirements? \n \nWe believe that requiring the inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not provide any \nbenefit to consumers, since the objective of alcoholic beverages labeling, from a health perspective, is \nto prevent harmful alcohol use. Therefore, including nutritional information on such beverages could \ncreate the perception that they have a ""nutritional benefit,"" which could cause confusion among \nconsumers. \n \nWe consider that this measure, which implies including information on caloric content, sodium content, \nsugar or fat content, among others, can influence the consumer’s perception of alcohol as healthier \nthan other products or foods. Therefore, it is extremely risky to combine two health objectives that could \nconfuse non -alcoholic beverages with alcoholic beverages, given that the calorie content, sodium \ncontent, sugar or fat content, among others, and the amount of alcohol, are diff erent elements in the \nconsumer\'s diet and are not comparable. \n \nBy its nature, alcohol should not be considered a food or a nutrient, so including the nutrimental \ninformation on the label of alcoholic beverages can lead to consumer confusion, understanding that \nalcoholic beverages provide nutrients similar to food, and this may influence their purchasing decision \nand favor the consumption of one beverage over another without taki ng into account the amount of \nalcohol that each product contains. \n \nMaking this labeling mandatory would also add costs for producers, importers, and distributors, which \ngoes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers to international  \ntrade. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly recommend allowing this \ninformation to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This makes the information accessible \nto consumers without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial burdens. \nDigital labeling offers many advantages: \n• Unlimited space to inform consumers. \n• Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n• Easy updating as regulations change. \n• Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks of \nharmful alcohol consumption. \n• Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. \n \nThis approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using \ntechnology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. \nFinally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to implement \nthese changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for distribution in \nthe U.S. \n \n2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be \nallowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further \nbreakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \n \nAs previously noted, the inclusion of expanded nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels \ncould lead consumers to mistakenly believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious \nconfusion. Evidence from the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) \nshows that labeling can be an effective tool for informing consumers, but only when the information is \nclear, concise, and relevant. Overloading labels with excessive or complex data may result in confusion \nor misinformation, undermining the goal of providing accessible and useful consumer information. \n \n \n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such \nas trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? \n \nAs previously mentioned, including nutritional information on alcoholic beverages may lead consumers \nto believe these products offer nutritional benefits, causing significant confusion. Specifically, elements \nlike dietary fiber could reinforce this misconception, suggesting added health value. Therefore, it is not \nrecommended to include any of the nutritional components proposed. Rather than being helpful, such \ndeclarations could directly mislead consumers and result in misinterpretation. \n \n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol \nbeverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create  \nan erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other \nhealth-related benefits? \n \nIncluding nutritional information on alcoholic beverage labels may lead consumers to mistakenly \nbelieve these products offer nutritional benefits, causing serious confusion. Specifically, elements like \ndietary fiber could reinforce this misconception by su ggesting added health value. Therefore, such \ninformation should not be required in any form.  \n \nIn Mexico, legislation explicitly prohibits alcoholic beverages from referencing any nutritional benefits \nor therapeutic properties. According to Article 308 of the General Health Law, advertising must focus \nsolely on product characteristics, quality, and production methods, without implying health or wellness \nbenefits. Additionally, Article 307 prohibits associating non -alcoholic food and beverage advertising \nwith alcohol consumption or promoting harmful dietary habits, while Article 6 of the Advertising \nRegulation reinforces the ban on attributing preventive, therapeutic, or nutritional qualities to products. \nThese declarations, rather than being helpful, could mislead consumers and distort public health \nmessaging. \n \nIn summary, Mexican legislation is clear in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or health \nbenefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such declarations \non labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. \n \n \n5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in \nadvertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? \nNo comments on this topic. \n \n \n6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage products? How might \nconsumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the identity \nand quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not  include Alcohol Facts \nlabeling? How do those benefits compare to the costs and regulatory burdens associated with \nsuch revisions? \n \nThe current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol Facts"" \npanel would not provide any benefits to consumer s and would generate unnecessary costs and \nregulatory burdens. \n \n \n7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol \nbeverage market? \n  \nMaking a change in the labels of these products would generate an extra cost for manufacturers, \nimporters, and distributors, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. Therefore, if adopted, \nthis proposal would create unnecessary barriers to trade in violation of Article 2.2 of the WTO \nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, that establishes that “… technical regulations shall not be \nmore trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non -\nfulfilment would create”. \n \n8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and,  in \nparticular, new businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? \n \nThe proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, especially \nsmall and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional analyses, packaging \nand labeling modifications, new shipments, and the re structuring of supply chains for the U.S. market. \nThis burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. \n \n9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect international trade of \nalcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the \nproposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? \n \nTo reduce operational costs and improve access to detailed information, electronic labeling is \nrecommended. This approach would help avoid trade barriers and harmonize requirements \ninternationally, minimizing the impact of new labeling rules on producers and supply chains. \n \n \nConclusion: \n \nDetailed nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages may confuse consumers by implying health \nbenefits. If required, such information should be provided voluntarily or via electronic labeling to avoid \nregulatory burdens and disproportionate costs, especially for international and small producers. \n \n \nBest regards, \n \n \n \nRocio Melendrez Ramirez \nRepresentative \n \nMembers of the “Alianza para la Sustentabilidad”: Casa Xipe; Del Maguey Single Village Mezcal; Mezcal Los Danzantes; Mezcal Amarás; Mezcal El Tinieblo; \nMezcal Júrame; Marqués del Jaral de Berrio; Casa Mezcal Huitzila; Mezcal Amaxak; Promotora y Comercializadora de Destilados SA de CV; Casa Parada \nMezcal; Santa Fátima; WYN Spirits S. de R.L de C.V./Dos Hombres.

The \nmain objective is to provide consumers with more comprehensive and clear information about the \nalcoholic beverages they consume, similar to the nutrition information found on foods. \nKey points of the proposal: \n\uf0b7 ""Alcohol Facts"" Panel: The creation of a mandatory panel  on alcoholic beverage labels is \nproposed, similar to the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel on foods. This panel would include: \n1. Alcohol content per serving:  Expressed as alcohol by volume (ABV) and as fluid \nounces of pure alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). \n2. Calories per serving: The amount of calories in each standard serving. \n3. Basic nutrients: Includes the declaration of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. \n4. Standard serving size and number of servings per container:  The proposal \nestablishes specific ser ving sizes for each type of alcoholic beverage, which vary \ndepending on their alcohol content. For example: \ni. Malt beverages with no more than 7% alcohol: 12 fl oz (355 ml) \nii. Wines: \n1. 5 fl oz (148 ml) for wines with 7-16% alcohol. \n2. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) for products with 16% to 24% alc./vol. \niii. Distilled spirits: \n1. 12 fl oz (355 ml) if they contain up to 7% alc./vol.; \n2. 5 fl oz (148 ml) between 7% and 16% alc./vol.; \n3. 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) between 16% and 24% alc./vol.; and 1.5 fluid \nounces (44 ml) \n4. 50 ml for 50 ml containers if they exceed 24% alc./vol. \n \n\uf0b7 Flexible presentation formats: The ""Alcohol Facts"" panel would be presented in different \nformats, adapting to the container size and beverage content. \n \n \n \n \n \nCompliance Period: A period of 5 years from the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register \nis proposed for producers and distributors to comply with the new requirements. \n \nComments on the proposal: \n\uf0b7 Alcohol content: We view the inclusion of the alcohol content declaration positively, but \nquestion the necessity of including fluid ounces of ethanol, as this information is not \nconsidered relevant to the average consumer. In fact, the Official Mexican Standard NOM-\n006-SCFI-2012, Alcoholic Beverages -Tequila-Specifications already provides for the \ndeclaration of the product\'s alcohol content. \n\uf0b7 Serving and servings per container: The importance of consumers knowing the amount of \nalcohol in each container and each standard serving is recognized. However, it is suggested \nthat this information be provided voluntarily or through elect ronic labeling (QR codes, \ndigital platforms, websites) to avoid additional costs and unnecessary regulatory burdens. \n\uf0b7 Nutritional information: Including nutritional information (calories, carbohydrates, fats, \nproteins) on alcoholic beverage labels could confuse consumers. It could be interpreted as \nif these beverages have nutritional benefits, which is contrary to CODEX Alimentarius \nguidelines. It is emphasized that alcohol should not be considered a food or nutrient and \nthat nutritional information could di stract from the risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption. \nKey Questions from the TTB: \n1. Should TTB’s proposed nutrient  content labeling statement be more  consistent with the \nNutrition Facts Label found on foods that are under FDA’s labeling jurisdiction? Alternatively, do \nthe differences  between alcohol beverages and other  foods make it unnecessary, or even  \nmisleading, to adopt the type of nutrient  labeling required on food labels that are under FDA’s \nlabeling jurisdiction? For example, would information on the percentage of the daily value of the \nlisted nutrients provided by alcohol  beverages be useful information for  consumers? \nAlternatively, could such statements mislead consumers by implying that they may rely on alcohol \nbeverage consumption to satisfy part of their daily nutrient requirements? \nOur position highli ghts that requiring the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel on labels would not genuinely \nbenefit consumers. From a public health perspective, the true objective of alcoholic beverage \nlabeling is to discourage harmful alcohol consumption. Including nutritional information on labels \ncould easily lead people to believe that these beverages have some sort of health benefit, which \nwould only create confusion. Alcoholic beverages simply do not provide nutrients. Putting \nnutritional information on labels could give consumers t he wrong idea, making them think that \nalcohol fits into a balanced diet or offers essential nutrients. This could skew their purchasing \ndecisions, distracting them from the most important information: alcohol content. \nFurthermore, it is misleading to compa re alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because they are \nfundamentally different. Elements like calories, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats in alcoholic \nbeverages simply cannot be compared to normal food, because the key difference is the alcohol \nitself. At tempting to use nutritional labeling (including calories) to prevent harmful alcohol \nconsumption could even be counterproductive. It could make consumers perceive alcohol as \nsomehow healthy or harmless, potentially leading to worse health consequences than  current \nlabeling was trying to prevent. It is risky to confuse non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. They are \ndistinct products, with distinct target consumers, and should not be presented as comparable. Making this labeling mandatory would also add cost s for producers, importers, and distributors, \nwhich goes against trade agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT \nAgreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which prohibits creating unnecessary barriers \nto international tra de. However, if the ""Alcohol Facts"" panel becomes mandatory, we strongly \nrecommend allowing this information to be presented digitally (QR codes, websites, etc.). This \nmakes the information accessible without creating unnecessary regulatory and commercial \nburdens. \nDigital labeling offers many advantages: \n\uf0b7 Unlimited space to inform consumers. \n\uf0b7 Consumer-friendly and easy-to-understand format. \n\uf0b7 Easy updating as regulations change. \n\uf0b7 Effective communication with vulnerable groups (such as young people) about the risks \nof harmful alcohol consumption. \n\uf0b7 Opportunity to create engaging and educational content. \n \nThis approach is in line with the ""Guidance for providing food information to consumers by using \ntechnology"", which is being developed by the CODEX Alimentarius Committee on Food Labeling. \nFinally, we believe that a gradual implementation period of 5 years would be the best way to \nimplement these changes, particularly to give small producers time to adapt their supply chains for \ndistribution in the U.S. \n2. For greater consistency with the FDA Nutrition Facts Label, should Alcohol Facts statements be \nallowed or required to include other elements (such as sodium and cholesterol) or a further \nbreakdown of fat (to include saturated fat and trans-fat)? \nIt is not recommended to include additional information on sodium, cholesterol, or saturated and \ntrans fats. The inclusion of more nutritional information could increase confusion and reinforce the \nmisconception that alcoholic beverages have nutritional benefits. \n3. Would the inclusion of elements not ordinarily expected to be found in alcohol beverages (such \nas trans-fat and dietary fiber) be useful or potentially misleading? \nThe inclusion of items such as trans fats and dietary fiber would not be useful and could be \nmisle ading. These elements are not relevant to alcoholic beverages and their inclusion could \nconfuse consumers. \n4. Should TTB allow numerical statements of the vitamin and mineral content of alcohol \nbeverages, assuming the product contains vitamins or minerals, or could such a statement create \nan erroneous impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage has nutritional value or other \nhealth-related benefits? \nIt is not recommended to include numerical declarations of vitamin and mineral content. This could \ncreate a misleading  impression that alcoholic beverages have nutritional value, which is not true \nand could be harmful to public health. In Mexico, laws prohibit alcoholic beverages from being promoted with nutritional, therapeutic, or \nrehabilitation benefits. \nThe General Health Law, in its article 308, establishes that advertising for these beverages must be \nlimited to describing their characteristics, quality, and how they are made, without presenting them \nas something that improves health or well-being. \nFurthermore, article 307 of the same law prohibits advertising for food and non-alcoholic beverages \nfrom being directly or indirectly related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or from \npromoting harmful eating habits. \nThe Regulations of the General Health Law on Advertising, in its article 6, reinforces this prohibition \nby establishing that advertising for no product may attribute preventative, therapeutic, \nrehabilitative, nutritional, stimulating, or any other type of quality. \nIn summary, Mexican legislation is clear  in prohibiting the attribution of nutritional properties or \nhealth benefits that they do not possess to alcoholic beverages. This is because including such \ndeclarations on labeling could confuse consumers instead of providing useful information. \n5. How many industry members already provide nutrient content information on labels, in \nadvertisements (such as websites), or upon request (for example, to consumers or restaurants)? \nNo comments on this topic. \n6. Do consumers want to see Alcohol Facts labeling on alcohol beverage pro ducts? How might \nconsumers benefit from such a label? Do consumers have adequate information about the \nidentity and quality of alcohol beverages if alcohol beverage containers do not include Alcohol \nFacts labeling? How do those benefits compare to the cost s and regulatory burdens associated \nwith such revisions? \nThe current information on alcoholic beverage labeling is sufficient. The inclusion of the ""Alcohol \nFacts"" panel would not provide significant ben efits to the consumer and would generate \nunnecessary costs and regulatory burdens. \n7. How, if at all, would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect competition in the alcohol \nbeverage market? \nThis measure would impose excessive costs and regulatory burdens on producers, importers, and \ndistributors of alcoholic beverages, particularly harming small and emerging businesses. This would \ngo against the spirit of Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to prevent the imposition of technical \nregulations that unnecessarily restrict international trade, unless there are legitimate objectives \njustified by member states. \nAccording to the TBT Agreement, technical regulations sho uld not limit trade more than strictly \nnecessary to achieve a legitimate objective. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed measures \nwould have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers. This is mainly due to the increased \ncosts associated  with additional product analyses, modifications to packaging and labeling, new \nshipments, and especially the restructuring of supply chains for the U.S. alcoholic beverage market. 8. How would the new mandatory labeling requirements affect small businesses and, in particular, \nnew businesses entering into the alcohol beverage marketplace? \nThe proposed regulation would have a disproportionate impact on international suppliers, \nespecially small and new producers. This is due to increased costs associated with additional  \nanalyses, packaging and labeling modifications, new shipments, and the restructuring of supply \nchains for the U.S. market. This burden could even force some small producers to leave the market. \n9. How, if at all, would the new mandatory lab eling requirements affect international trade of \nalcohol beverages? Is there any information that should, or should not, be included to align the \nproposed labeling requirements with those of other countries? \nIt is certain that the new labeling requirements would have a negative impact on international trade \nin alcoholic beverages, as they would increase costs and complexity. To avoid this, it is suggested to \nconsider harmonizing such requirements with those of other countries, as well as implementing the \nuse of tools such as elec tronic labeling, which allows for much more information than physical \nlabels, while reducing operational costs. \nConclusion: Detailed nutritional labeling could confuse consumers, and information about alcohol \nis sufficient. It is proposed that, in any case , nutritional information be voluntary or provided \nelectronically. It is reiterated that the implementation of the proposal would generate significant \ncosts, especially affecting small and new businesses, as well as international trade in alcoholic \nbeverages in general. \nEnd of the document  '}, {'source': 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/TTB-2025-0002-0203/attachment_1.pdf', 'text': 'On behalf of the Government of Mexico, please find attached the consolidated \ncomments of the Mexican alcoholic beverages industry regarding the Alcohol \nand Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s (TTB) proposal (Notice No. 237) to amend \nthe labeling of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages, notified\n(G/TBT/N/USA/2182) to the WTO TBT Committee in accordance with Article 2.9.2 \nof the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement).\nWhile Mexico recognizes the objective of providing consumers with clear and \ncomprehensive information, our industry expresses serious concerns that the \nproposed mandatory “Alcohol Facts” panel—particularly the inclusion of detailed \nnutritional information—could mislead consumers by suggesting that alcoholic \nbeverages provide nutritional or health benefits.
